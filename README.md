# Birds

Birds is one of the domains, which is a part of the IndicWiki Project.

## Description

The aim of this domain is to create a large number of articles (about 10000) about Birds. Hence, we are generating these data-rich articles in telugu for about 10000 Birds, and uploading them to wikipedia, so that people who can read only in their native language (here, telugu) can benefit from this information.

## Installation and setup

Create virtual environment in the project folder using the following commands.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
pip install python3.9 
virtualenv -p python3.9 birdEnv
```

After the successful creation of virtual environment (venv), clone the repository or download the zip folder of the project and extract it. Run the following commands from the Birds (root) directory to activate the virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.

```bash
source birdEnv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

requirements.txt comes along with the Project Directory.

## Guide to generate XML dump, articles for different Birds

- Clone the repository into the local system.
- Enter the 'curDir' folder inside the cloned repo.
- Open the notebook file genXML.ipynb, Configure `From_n` and `To_n` variables then Execute the notebook by clicking on "Run all", where `From_n` and `To_n` correspond to the row numbers of the first and last desired articles (only serial order is possible). For example `From_n = 30` and `To_n = 50` would generate xml dump for Birds in rows 30-50 (inclusive). By default, dump is generated for all Birds (case where no mdifications are done).
- On executing the above Notebook xml dump is obtained in `birds.xml`. If `From_n` and `To_n` were modified then the file name would be birds_{From_n}-{To_n}.xml, names of these files would have the range passed in their filenames (such as `birds_30-50.xml` etc).

## Github Structure

- The Birds (root) folder contains files as
  - requirements.txt  → python requirements file
  - birds.xml   → the xml dump for all birds
  - report.html   → sweetviz report of the final dataset of birds

The folder curDir contains the entire implementation corresponding to article generation. This directory contains the codebase for the new model, converting knowledge base to intermediate structured article (dataframe of labeled article sentences) which can be modified and updated by users and then converting this data to XML page which can be imported in mediawiki.

It can be found [here](https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Birds/tree/main/curDir). All the below explained files and folders are inside this directory.

### data


> Github folder Link: <https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Birds/tree/main/curDir/data>
> Project Demo Video : [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR27ezvJV_4)

- This folder contains various datasets (final and intermediate), and the implementations as to how they were obtained. Different formats of the dataset are present as follows (like csv, excel etc):
  - _Birds.csv_  → This is a csv file containing all the data related to birds.
  - _Birds.html_  → HTML sweetviz report of the Bird dataset.
  - _Birds.pkl_  → This pickle file contains birds data.
  - _Birds.xlsx_  → Excel file containing data of all the 12000+ birds including all their attributes values.
  - _Birds\_Dataset\_English\_only.xlsx_  → Excel file containing data of all the birds only in english
  - _Dataset\_final.xlsx_     → Final Dataset of all the birds including both english and telugu translated values of attributes.

### scrape_new_data

> Github folder Link: <https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Birds/tree/main/curDir/scrape_data>

- This folder contains implementation and datasets corresponding to newly scraped data from different websites. There are 2 folders within this folder they are:

  - Translation  → Contains all the datasets that got translated columns wise in the form of csv, excel, pkl etc.
  - assets   → Contains all the datasets that are scraped from websites and put into an excel sheet and csv files.
    - all the intermediate files are saved in 3 types i.e,
   
   > CSV
   
   > EXCEL
   
   > PICKLE
  
  and sometimes `Log` files to log events while scarping.

- This folder also contains the code used to scrape the data from different websites.
  - Dibird\_Scrape\_Optim.py   → This is a python file used to scrape breeding region, Old Latin Name etc attributes of birds, Tools used are BeautifulSoup and Selenium. [dibird.com](https://dibird.com/)
  - _Ebird\_Scraper\_Optim.py_  → This is a python file used to scrape the data of birds, Tool used is BeautifulSoup. [ebird.org](https://ebird.org/home)
  - Eol\_Scraper\_Optim.py   → This is a python file used to scrape locomotion, Habitat etc attributes of birds, Tool used is BeautifulSoup [eol.org](https://eol.org/)
  - Iucn_Scraper_Optim.py   → This is a python file used to scrape the data of birds,Tool used is Selenium. [iucn.org](https://www.iucn.org/)
  - scrape_wikidata.ipynb   → This is a python Notebook file used to scrape the taxonomy data of the birds and the images of the birds, Tools used are BeautifulSoup and Selenium.
  
  
### assets

> Github folder Link: <https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Birds/tree/main/curDir/scrape_data/assets>

- This folder contains datasets corresponding to newly scraped data from different websites in units and code which can be recreated using python notebooks and merge them into a single dataset.
	- DataZone → This folder contains data of birds from the DataZone site, in which we got all then unique 12000+ birds to work on.
	- DCPP_Group_Assignment → This folder is a clone of github project named DCPP_Group_Assignment, which has code to scarpe data from wikipedia.

- Each of the below folder contains the data in 3 diiferent  formats namely csv ,excel and pickle to make them compatiable with all string encoding formats and softwares such as Microsoft excel , libre Office and etc.

	- ebird → This folder contains data scraped from the ebird site
	- rescrape → This folder contains data scraped from the ebird site, rescaped. 
	- rescrape_dibird → This folder contains data scraped from the dibird site
	- rescrape_eol → This folder contains data scraped from the eol site
	- rescrape_iucn → This folder contains data scraped from the iucn site
	- rescrape_wiki → This folder contains data scraped from the wikipedia site
	- Wikidata_Ultimate_Source → This folder contains data scraped from the Wikidata site


### Translation

> Github folder Link: <https://github.com/indicwiki-iiit/Birds/tree/main/curDir/scrape_data/Translation>

- This folder contains the backups, for every big progress in translation in dataset
	- Kaggle_out This folder contains all the out puts from the kaggle.com , which provides a GPU resource which speeds up translation.
