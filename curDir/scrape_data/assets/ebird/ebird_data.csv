Abbott's booby,"{""Abbott's Booby"": {'Order': 'Suliformes', 'Family': 'Sulidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Papasula abbotti', 'Description': 'Gangly, stretched-out-looking black-and-white seabird. Strikingly slender and strange-looking in flight. Breeds in the rainforest canopy of Christmas Island, and forages in the adjacent ocean. Some birds, especially immatures, will forage much farther afield, but the extent of these rangings is still poorly understood. Bizarre long-necked and slender-winged profile is unique, and should readily distinguish this species from any others in range. Bill is pale pink in females and grayish in males.'}}"
Abbott's starling,"{""Abbott's Starling"": {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Sturnidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Poeoptera femoralis', 'Description': 'A small, distinctive starling with a tiny range in Kenya and Tanzania. The male has a blue-black back and breast and a white belly. Females have a brown back and breast and a pale belly with brown streaks. Both sexes show a yellow eye. Uncommon and local in montane forest. Found in the canopy, in pairs or small flocks, often perching up conspicuously on dead snags and other open perches. Similar to Sharpe’s Starling, but has a dark breast. The calls include a sharp “sveet” and the song is a rapid, high-pitched tinkling phrase.'}}"

Abd al-Kuri sparrow,"{'Abd al Kuri Sparrow': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Passeridae', 'Scientific Name': 'Passer hemileucus', 'Description': 'Typical “rufous sparrow”, with a striped back and a gray crown, nape, and rump. Males have a black bib, and are brighter overall, with more rufous on the face and shoulder. Endemic to the Socotran island of Abd al Kuri, where it inhabits dry habitats, particularly rocky and scrubby slopes, sometimes around human settlements. The call is a cheerful “chirp”, often given in a slow series, similar to other sparrows. Similar to Socotra Sparrow, but separated by range.'}}"
Abdim's stork,"{""Abdim's Stork"": {'Order': 'Ciconiiformes', 'Family': 'Ciconiidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Ciconia abdimii', 'Description': 'A medium-sized, dark stork with a white belly. This gregarious African migrant often appears in huge nomadic flocks numbering in the thousands, normally in response to heavy rains or large fires, after which they forage on insect emergences. It prefers open grassland and woodland but also uses wetland margins and fields. Could be confused with the more solitary Black Stork, but Abdim’s Stork is smaller, has a white rump, and has a green-gray (not red) bill and dull (not bright red) legs.'}}"
Aberdare cisticola,"{'Aberdare Cisticola': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Cisticolidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Cisticola aberdare', 'Description': 'A large and relatively colorful cisticola endemic to Kenya, found locally in montane grassland and moorland. The cap and back of the neck are dull rufous with darker streaking, the back is heavily streaked with black, and there is a rufous panel in the wings. As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Very similar to Stout Cisticola, but has streaking on the back of the neck. The common vocalizations are a quick series of several squeaky notes, and a series of lower liquid notes.'}}"
Aberrant bush warbler,"{'Aberrant Bush Warbler': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Scotocercidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Horornis flavolivaceus', 'Description': 'Small shy warbler. Dull brown with a paler belly and brow stripe. Like most bush-warblers, difficult to see as it moves through dense foliage. Listen for its sweet song, consisting of a few introductory notes followed by two long whistles: “ti-ti-tchew weeeeee-cheeeeee’. Visually very difficult to separate from Yellowish-bellied Bush Warbler and Brownish-flanked Bush Warbler, and differences are extremely subtle. Himalayan breeders average more greenish on the back than either of the other two species, and have a strong yellow wash on the belly; Brownish-flanked, with which Aberrant overlaps in the eastern Himalayas, is much browner overall. In central China, Aberrant overlaps with Yellowish-bellied, which has a pale gray throat instead of a yellowish-buff one. Aberrant breeds in shrubby edge, bamboo stands, and open bushy areas in montane and hill areas; upper altitudinal limit averages higher than both Yellowish-bellied and Brownish-flanked.'}}"
Abert's towhee,"{""Abert's Towhee"": {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Passerellidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Melozone aberti', 'Description': 'Large, plain, long-tailed sparrow. Drab grayish-brown overall, with dark mask like a Northern Cardinal. Also note pinkish bill and orange undertail coverts. Inhabits riparian corridors, especially in dense brush. Mainly occurs in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, barely extending into surrounding states and northern Mexico. Rather secretive as it forages on the ground for seeds and insects. Visits feeders.'}}"
Abyssinian catbird,"{'Abyssinian Catbird': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Sylviidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Sylvia galinieri', 'Description': 'An unusual and distinctive warbler of the Ethiopian highlands. Mostly gray with chestnut under the tail, a red eye, black between the eye and bill, and a white patch above the eye. Found in dry montane juniper and hagenia forest. Easily separated from other gray warblers by the dark gray underparts and rufous undertail. Sometimes skulking, but will sing in the open; the male’s song is an explosive, variable combination of musical, fluted notes, usually accompanied by low ratcheting from the female.'}}"
