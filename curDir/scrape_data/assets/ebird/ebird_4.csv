Note neat black cap, bright white hindcollar, and black “M” across the uppersides of the wings. Extremely similar to White-necked Petrel; Vanuatu averages slightly smaller and smaller-billed overall, and with minimal amounts of white on the undersides of the primaries compared to White-necked. However, some Vanuatus can show significant white “tongues” in the primary undersides, and as such, identification remains extremely difficult away from the species’ core range in northern Vanuatu. Juan Fernandez Petrel can also be very similar, but lacks the bright white hindcollar and has even more extensive white tongues on the primary undersides.

Slightly smaller Parkinson’s Petrel looks very similar to Westland, but favors warmer tropical and subtropical waters and has a smaller, more rounded head and slightly slimmer bill.'}}"
Wetar figbird,"{'Wetar Figbird': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Oriolidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Sphecotheres hypoleucus', 'Description': 'A distinctive oriole confined to Wetar. A medium-sized, heavyset songbird with a stout bill. Male is striking, with a black head, obvious red skin around the eye, an olive upperside, and clean white underparts. Female is entirely gray-brown with extensive bold streaks on the underside. Juvenile resembles a poorly-streaked female. Groups occur in forest, edge, scrub, and cultivated areas. Male is unmistakable; heavily streaked underparts and bulky shape of female unlike any other species in range. Complex, chattering, buzzing starling-like song contains imitations of local birds. Call is a strident “WICK!”'}}"
Wetar ground dove,"{'Wetar Ground Dove': {'Order': 'Columbiformes', 'Family': 'Columbidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Alopecoenas hoedtii', 'Description': 'A fairly large ground-dwelling forest dove. Male is mostly dark with a diagnostic pale head and breast. Upperparts are rufous-brown, head pale gray, belly blackish-brown, and throat, neck, and breast cream-colored. Female entirely brown, with head, neck, and tail considerably more rufous than rest of body. Singles and small groups inhabit forested lowlands on Timor and Wetar islands. Female distinguished from Little and Timor Cuckoo-Doves by shorter tail, dark eyes, and absence of barring. The species gives a two-note hooting call with a short introductory note and an upslurred second one: “wu-wOOYOOP.”'}}"
Weyns's weaver,"{""Weyns's Weaver"": {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Ploceidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Ploceus weynsi', 'Description': ""A chunky weaver with a long, relatively thin bill.

Calls are usually an explosive pair or triad of notes that can be likened to “pee-bee!” or “pee-ah-bee!”'}}"
Whistler's warbler,"{""Whistler's Warbler"": {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Phylloscopidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Phylloscopus whistleri', 'Description': 'One of a confusingly similar complex of species, this medium-sized warbler has a bright yellow eye-ring, a pale and indistinct wingbar, and a grayish crown bordered by two long black stripes. The weakness and greenish cast of the gray crown separates this species from various other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, such as Gray-crowned. Golden-spectacled Warbler is very similar; in Whistler’s, look out for an unbroken eye-ring, a shorter bill, a longer tail, and slightly duller green upperparts. Whistler’s breeds in high-altitude temperate broadleaf forest from around 2000 meters up to the treeline; averages higher in altitudinal breeding preferences than Golden-spectacled Warbler. Like other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, Whistler’s typically forages at lower and middle levels of forest, often mixing with other species and making flycatching sallies. Song consists of a 2- or 3-noted whistled phrase repeated 2-3 times without pause, lacking the trills of Golden-spectacled Warbler.'}}"
Whistling cisticola,"{'Whistling Cisticola': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Cisticolidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Cisticola lateralis', 'Description': 'Large, plain cisticola. The most outstanding aspects of the plumage are the white underparts and two bands across the tip of the tail, one pale and one black. Found in a variety of open habitats, including moist savanna, scrub, overgrown cultivation, and forest edge and clearings. The distinctive song is a quick, liquid warble, given from a prominent perch. As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Fairly similar to Singing Cisticola, but lacks a rufous cap and panel in the wings. Also similar to Trilling and Chattering Cisticolas, but lacks rufous on the cap.'}}"
