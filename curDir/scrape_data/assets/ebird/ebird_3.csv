Also similar to male Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush, but smaller, lacking white on the back, and with a more extensive gray hood. The quiet song consists of musical phrases that can be short or quite long.'}}"
Little rush warbler,"{'Little Rush Warbler': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Locustellidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Bradypterus baboecala', 'Description': 'A nondescript long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Varies geographically: the back can be dark brown or rusty brown, and the underparts can have heavy distinct streaking or a bit of blurry streaking. Found in reedbed wetland habitat, including papyrus. Extremely secretive and skulking. Most often seen when it sits up to sing or gives a short display flight. Song starts with slow, hesitant, low wooden notes that speed up, then ends with a trill made by beating the wings together at incredible speed. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed-warblers and swamp-warblers. Very similar to Highland Rush Warbler, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Little sings a much lower-pitched song.'}}"

Mainly sedentary and relatively shy, feeding farther offshore than similar seabirds. Winter breeding birds mainly found around the Kermadec Islands, off southwest Australia, and off the northeastern coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The Fluttering Shearwater can be distinguished by its larger size, smudgy brown underwing, dark face, and tendency to congregate in flocks much closer to shore.'}}"

Male produces a series of burry, rising high-pitched whistles. Female has a lower ascending burry whistle. Both sexes repeat their call many times, often duetting.

Adults in breeding plumage are variably flushed with bright rusty orange on the head, neck sides, and upperparts, usually brightest in mid- to late-summer. Compared with breeding Red-necked Stint, note white throat and more uniformly bright wing coverts and scapulars on Little. Juveniles are typically quite bright and neatly patterned above, often with bold white stripes or ""braces"" down the back, and have very black-centered wing coverts and tertials. Nonbreeding birds rather plain pale gray and extremely difficult to separate from other small “peeps”. Note bill shape and overall structure. Temminck’s has longer tail and more crouched posture; Red-necked has slightly shorter bill and legs and more attenuated wings. Found in fresh and brackish wetland habitats.

Best distinguished by voice: a sharp, high-pitched “keek!” note, sometimes given in a series, unlike lower-pitched “tu-tu-tu” call of Short-billed. At all ages, look for subtle structural differences: Long-billed averages more hunch-backed, slightly longer-billed, and slightly taller, especially noticeable when in a mixed flock. Breeding birds have solidly salmon-orange underparts and rather dark upperparts with narrow rufous edges and white tips. Also look for sparse barring on the sides contrasting with denser spotting on the neck. Nonbreeding plumage is brownish-gray overall with a paler belly; extremely similar to Short-billed but averaging slightly darker and less patterned, especially on the breast and sides.

As with many other pipits, can be frustratingly difficult to identify in the field; habitat and voice are important clues. Prefers dry, open areas with clumps of vegetation and scattered rocks and boulders, typically on slopes. Calls include squeaky sparrow-like chirps and sweet two-noted whistles.

During the breeding season, favors fast-moving streams with lots of rocks to hop on. In the northern parts of its range, often in steep hemlock-lined ravines. Winters primarily in Middle America and the Caribbean, where it’s slightly less picky about habitat, and can be found around slower-moving water.

Males perform aerial displays high overhead in which they quickly open their wings and tails to create a two-parted sound like a bow on a string that gradually grows louder, “huhwa, huh-wa, HUH-WA.” Despite its distinctive displays, the bird can be frustratingly difficult to locate and see.'}}"

Females lack long tail; look for more prominent rufous collar to help distinguish from Swallow-tailed Nightjar. Often associated with steep road cuts, landslides, or cliff faces within forests of the subtropical zones. Males roost during the day on vines or branches that allow their long tail to hang down; females more apt to roost on the ground.

In North America, females can be tricky to distinguish from American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, and Mexican Duck where ranges overlap. Those species are all darker-bodied than Mallard. A good view of the wing can be helpful, too: white wingbars on the leading and trailing edges of the blue wing patch are bolder on Mallard.
