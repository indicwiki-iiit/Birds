Cuban martin,"{'Cuban Martin': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Hirundinidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Progne cryptoleuca', 'Description': 'A graceful aerial feeder found over a wide variety of open habitats, especially near water, including marshes and towns. Often chooses exposed perches including power and telephone lines in villages. Commonly found in flocks of up to twenty birds, sometimes mixing with other swallows and martins. The adult male is entirely glossy purple-blue and is inseparable in the field from male Purple Martins. The male Caribbean Martin can be distinguished by its bright white belly. Female and immature Cuban Martins resemble females and immatures of both Purple and Caribbean Martin. Purple Martin in such plumages can be identified by a scaly breast pattern and often fine streaks on the belly, which is lacking on female and immature Cuban Martins. Female Cuban Martins are probably not safely separable from Caribbean Martin, though on average the Cuban Martin has more restricted brown on chest. Note that Caribbean and Purple Martins are not present in this species’ range from March to September, which can help eliminate confusing species. Calls include a harsh “churr,” a buzzy “zwick-zwick,” and a musical buzzy burbling.'}}"

Grimwood's longclaw,"{""Grimwood's Longclaw"": {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Motacillidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Macronyx grimwoodi', 'Description': 'A large pipit-like bird that is much less colorful than other longclaws, with a dull pinkish-buff throat, cinnamon-tawny underparts and extensive dense dark streaking elsewhere. During the breeding season the throat and belly may flush brighter pink, and a small white shoulder patch may be visible. Pairs are localized residents, preferring short grass on floodplains and dambos (seasonally flooded wetlands); retreating to wettest habitats where other longclaws co-occur. Calls an extended series of high-pitched trilling or buzzing notes that sound insect-like, different from other longclaws. Similar but smaller Rosy-throated Longclaw differs from Grimwood’s by having a bold black gorget and brighter pink throat and underparts.'}}"
Groove-billed ani,"{'Groove-billed Ani': {'Order': 'Cuculiformes', 'Family': 'Cuculidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Crotophaga sulcirostris', 'Description': 'Anis are bizarre, coal-black cuckoos with long floppy tails and unique, curiously tall, flattened bills. Groove-billed occurs in a variety of open and semi-open habitats in tropical lowlands and foothills, typically staying low in shrubs and grasses. Gregarious and not particularly graceful; usually seen crashing around awkwardly in small groups. Flies with choppy wingbeats and long glides. Widespread and common throughout Middle America, as far north as Texas. In South America, primarily occurs west of the Andes; also in inter-Andean valleys and lowlands of northern Colombia and Venezuela. Compare with the very similar Smooth-billed Ani, which overlaps locally. Note especially the bill shape: Groove-billed typically has a lower, more evenly rounded top edge to the bill without an obvious keel, and the lower edge of the bill is straighter. Grooves are distinctive but can be difficult to see. Voice is also important: listen for a sharp “PIT!-tooee” and other sharp clicks and whistles.'}}"

Very long tail. Juvenile finely barred above. This species struts around in open arid and semi-arid regions in small parties or perches high in dead trees. Sometimes mistaken for Australian Magpie from a great distance, a species that also perches in snags. Calls include a loud, piercing whistle and chattering.'}}"
Ground tit,"{'Ground Tit': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Paridae', 'Scientific Name': 'Pseudopodoces humilis', 'Description': 'A strange little bird of highland pastures, meadows, and dry steppe. Doesn’t resemble any other tit; looks a bit like a tiny corvid, and formerly classified as one. Dusty brown above and white below with a dark, curved bill. Often in small groups, sometimes associating with larks and snowfinches, as well as with pikas and marmots, whose burrows they use as shelter. Bold and adaptable, often foraging in and around villages and towns.'}}"

In flight it shows distinctive large buff patches in the broad wings. The isolated simiensis race in the highlands of the Horn of Africa is warmer above and below and may be split as a separate species. Pairs and small groups occupy moorland, grassland, and open woodland, favoring heavily grazed and burned areas. It runs long distances on the ground hunting invertebrates, stopping bolt upright and flicking its wings. The song is a grating, unmelodic “lit-sit-siru-pa.”'}}"
Growling riflebird,"{'Growling Riflebird': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Paradisaeidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Ptiloris intercedens', 'Description': 'A large bird of lowland and foothill forest in eastern New Guinea. The bill is fairly long, slightly curved and more feathered in the base than its sister species. Male is mainly black with a blue breast shield, bordered with a pale line below. Female and juveniles are brown above and pale below with dark barring. Almost identical to the more widespread Magnificent Riflebird but does not co-occur. Female similar to female Twelve-wired Bird-of-Paradise, but has a striped rather than black head. More often heard than seen. Voice, a growled “raahh! raooo!”.'}}"

Bill is blackish with a reddish base. Prefers mature and dense secondary forest, often perching low. No other dwarf-kingfisher shares its range. Told from Common Kingfisher by smaller size and red base to bill. Call apparently nearly identical to that of other Melanesian dwarf-kingfishers: a high-pitched, weak repetitive whistle, often given in flight.'}}"
Guadalcanal honeyeater,"{'Guadalcanal Honeyeater': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Meliphagidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Guadalcanaria inexpectata', 'Description': 'A medium-sized honeyeater, mostly dark bluish-gray with olive tones to the upperparts. Bill relatively short and slightly decurved. Bright yellow neck tuft distinctive. Prefers primary montane forest above 950 meters of elevation, more commonly above 1450 meters of elevation. Vocally little known, but said to give a loud, musical “per-twee, per-twee.”'}}"
Guadalcanal thrush,"{'Guadalcanal Thrush': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Turdidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Zoothera turipavae', 'Description': 'Mostly ground-dwelling. A very dark, dusky bird with a rich brown crown and upperside. Underside is creamy brown with heavy scaling that becomes finer on the throat and face. Note the buffy eye-ring. Uncommon in forest above 1400 meters of elevation. Island Thrush has a similar shape but is black with yellow legs, bill, and eye-ring.

Small and slender with a long tail; mostly dark gray with a broken white eyering, white belly, and white outer tail feathers. Inhabits canopy of tall forest, especially in regions with sandy soils, and also occurs in shorter-stature forests on white sand. Usually seen with mixed-species flocks as it forages actively in outer foliage, sallying for insects and gleaning from leaves, moving long tail from side to side, like other gnatcatchers. Thin and indistinct call notes are easily overlooked among calls of other species in flocks, but distinctive shape, active behavior, and long tail with much white should clinch identification. Distinguished from Tropical Gnatcatcher by uniform gray body plumage and lack of a black cap.'}}"
Guianan puffbird,"{'Guianan Puffbird': {'Order': 'Galbuliformes', 'Family': 'Bucconidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Notharchus macrorhynchos', 'Description': 'Chunky, large-billed bird of rainforest canopy; easily identified by black-and-white plumage, relatively large size, and staid demeanor. Most often seen perched high in bare branches, sometimes near arboreal termite nests, in which it digs its own nest cavities. May also forage at lower levels.

Found in a variety of forest habitats including primary and secondary rainforest, low-stature forests with sandy soils, and along river edges. Often sits on leaf clusters at the ends of branches, sallying for insects; also feeds on fruit. Heard far more than seen. Most common call is a dry, two-noted hiccup that is easily overlooked; dawn song is a repeated, rising twitter.'}}"
Guianan warbling antbird,"{'Guianan Warbling-Antbird': {'Order': 'Passeriformes', 'Family': 'Thamnophilidae', 'Scientific Name': 'Hypocnemis cantator', 'Description': 'Small antbird; most easily identified by conspicuously striped head, contrasting tawny flanks, and sluggish behavior. Most common in disturbed and secondary forests, at forest edges, and near treefall gaps. Almost always found in pairs and within a few meters of the ground; sometimes follows army ants and understory mixed-species flocks. Very vocal and not shy but can be hard to see well; often scolds observers while darting from perch to perch.'}}"

Feeds on invertebrates and crabs in mud and marshes; often patrols the edges of ponds but does not grab fish from the water like other terns.'}}"
Gundlach's hawk,"{""Gundlach's Hawk"": {'Order': 'Accipitriformes', 'Family': 'Accipitridae', 'Scientific Name': 'Accipiter gundlachi', 'Description': 'A secretive raptor of wooded habitats including mangrove swamps. Though this species sometime soars, its flight is usually powered by several rapid flaps followed by a brief glide. In flight, note the long rounded tail, short rounded wings, and a large head that protrudes well in front of the wings. Adults are barred orange below while immatures are streaked brown. The similar Sharp-shinned Hawk is somewhat smaller in body and head and has a shorter, squared-off tail. Migrant Sharp-Shinned Hawks from North America are scarce within this species’ range, and are best told by structure and size. Resident Sharp-shinned Hawks, which share this species’ range are conveniently barred gray below. Immature Sharp-shinned Hawks can also be distinguished from Gundlach’s by their narrow, but distinct white eyebrow. The Broad-winged Hawk is somewhat similar, but it is much shorter tailed and somewhat longer winged.

At a distance, look for black back with “sails” sticking up, powdery-blue nape, and enormous orange knob on the face. Immature male is variable but usually dark brown or blackish overall with paler breast and orange bill. Female is buffy-brown with a blackish bill shaped to look like she’s smiling. Extensive breeding range across the Arctic tundra; winters at slightly lower latitudes, rarely as far south as the mid-Atlantic states of the U.S. Most often seen singly or in small flocks on the ocean, often mixed with Common Eider or other sea ducks.
