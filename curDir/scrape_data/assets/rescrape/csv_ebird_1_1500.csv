0,Abbott's Booby,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Sulidae,Papasula abbotti,https://ebird.org/species/abbboo2,"Gangly, stretched-out-looking black-and-white seabird. Strikingly slender and strange-looking in flight. Breeds in the rainforest canopy of Christmas Island, and forages in the adjacent ocean. Some birds, especially immatures, will forage much farther afield, but the extent of these rangings is still poorly understood. Bizarre long-necked and slender-winged profile is unique, and should readily distinguish this species from any others in range. Bill is pale pink in females and grayish in males."
0,Abbott's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Poeoptera femoralis,https://ebird.org/species/abbsta2,"A small, distinctive starling with a tiny range in Kenya and Tanzania. The male has a blue-black back and breast and a white belly. Females have a brown back and breast and a pale belly with brown streaks. Both sexes show a yellow eye. Uncommon and local in montane forest. Found in the canopy, in pairs or small flocks, often perching up conspicuously on dead snags and other open perches. Similar to Sharpe’s Starling, but has a dark breast. The calls include a sharp “sveet” and the song is a rapid, high-pitched tinkling phrase."
0,Abdim's Stork,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Ciconia abdimii,https://ebird.org/species/abdsto1,"A medium-sized, dark stork with a white belly. This gregarious African migrant often appears in huge nomadic flocks numbering in the thousands, normally in response to heavy rains or large fires, after which they forage on insect emergences. It prefers open grassland and woodland but also uses wetland margins and fields. Could be confused with the more solitary Black Stork, but Abdim’s Stork is smaller, has a white rump, and has a green-gray (not red) bill and dull (not bright red) legs."
0,Aberdare Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola aberdare,https://ebird.org/species/abecis1,"A large and relatively colorful cisticola endemic to Kenya, found locally in montane grassland and moorland. The cap and back of the neck are dull rufous with darker streaking, the back is heavily streaked with black, and there is a rufous panel in the wings. As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Very similar to Stout Cisticola, but has streaking on the back of the neck. The common vocalizations are a quick series of several squeaky notes, and a series of lower liquid notes."
0,Aberrant Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Horornis flavolivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/abbwar1,"Small shy warbler. Dull brown with a paler belly and brow stripe. Like most bush-warblers, difficult to see as it moves through dense foliage. Listen for its sweet song, consisting of a few introductory notes followed by two long whistles: “ti-ti-tchew weeeeee-cheeeeee’. Visually very difficult to separate from Yellowish-bellied Bush Warbler and Brownish-flanked Bush Warbler, and differences are extremely subtle. Himalayan breeders average more greenish on the back than either of the other two species, and have a strong yellow wash on the belly; Brownish-flanked, with which Aberrant overlaps in the eastern Himalayas, is much browner overall. In central China, Aberrant overlaps with Yellowish-bellied, which has a pale gray throat instead of a yellowish-buff one. Aberrant breeds in shrubby edge, bamboo stands, and open bushy areas in montane and hill areas; upper altitudinal limit averages higher than both Yellowish-bellied and Brownish-flanked."
0,Abert's Towhee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Melozone aberti,https://ebird.org/species/abetow,"Large, plain, long-tailed sparrow. Drab grayish-brown overall, with dark mask like a Northern Cardinal. Also note pinkish bill and orange undertail coverts. Inhabits riparian corridors, especially in dense brush. Mainly occurs in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, barely extending into surrounding states and northern Mexico. Rather secretive as it forages on the ground for seeds and insects. Visits feeders."
0,Abyssinian Catbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Sylvia galinieri,https://ebird.org/species/abycat1,"An unusual and distinctive warbler of the Ethiopian highlands. Mostly gray with chestnut under the tail, a red eye, black between the eye and bill, and a white patch above the eye. Found in dry montane juniper and hagenia forest. Easily separated from other gray warblers by the dark gray underparts and rufous undertail. Sometimes skulking, but will sing in the open; the male’s song is an explosive, variable combination of musical, fluted notes, usually accompanied by low ratcheting from the female."
0,Abyssinian Crimsonwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Cryptospiza salvadorii,https://ebird.org/species/abcwin1,"Small, dark member of the waxbill family. The back is red, the wings and tail black, and the underparts gray. Males and females are similar, though males show a bit of red on the flanks. Found in montane forest, mainly in thick and wet areas such as along streams, including forest edge and glades. Inconspicuous bird that is usually found in pairs or small groups. The call is a high-pitched “tsit.” Similar in size and overall coloration to Red-faced Crimsonwing, but darker, and doesn’t show red or yellow on the face."
0,Abyssinian Ground-Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucorvidae,Bucorvus abyssinicus,https://ebird.org/species/noghor1,"A huge ground-dwelling hornbill. Males have a mix of blue and red bare facial skin, while females have entirely blue facial skin. In flight, a large white patch is revealed in the wings. Found in savanna, grassland, and agricultural habitats, usually in pairs or small groups, walking on the ground. Breeds and roosts in trees. Similar to Southern Ground-Hornbill, but there is little overlap in range, and Abyssinian is easily separated by the blue facial skin. The call is a series of deep “boop” notes."

In flight, the spectacular wings are half pale blue and half dark blue. Found in dry savanna and other open country. Usually seen singly or in pairs. Easily separated from Lilac-breasted Roller by the blue throat. Occasionally lacks elongated outer tail feathers, and then very similar to European Roller, but separated by the dark blue rather than black outer wing. The calls are rough rasps."
0,Abyssinian Scimitarbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Phoeniculidae,Rhinopomastus minor,https://ebird.org/species/absbil1,"This all-black bird has a curved orange bill and a fairly long tail. Northern birds have white bars across the wings, which are conspicuous in flight, while southern birds have entirely black wings. Found in dry savanna and thornscrub. Separated from other scimitarbills by its orange bill. Similar to some woodhoopoes, but separated by its smaller size, shorter all-black tail, and black legs. Vocalizations include a series of wavering, rising notes and an agitated-sounding series of “dok” notes."
0,Abyssinian Slaty-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis chocolatinus,https://ebird.org/species/abyslf1,"A gray-brown flycatcher endemic to the Abyssinian highlands. Darker on the upperparts and paler below with a distinctive white eye. Found in montane habitats including woodland, forest edge, and lush gardens. Could be confused with African Gray or Pale Flycatchers, but found in different habitats, and easily identified by the pale eye. Found in the same areas as African Dusky Flycatcher, but larger, with a pale eye."
0,Abyssinian Ground-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Geokichla piaggiae,https://ebird.org/species/abgthr1,"Large, brown-backed, orange-breasted thrush with bold white wingbars.

0,Abyssinian Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe lugubris,https://ebird.org/species/mouwhe4,"A dark wheatear in which males and females are very different. Males are black above with a dark-streaked gray cap. There is individual and geographical variation in belly color, which can be either black or white. Females have a dark brown back and heavily streaked paler underparts. Both sexes have a buff undertail and a black-and-buff tail with a “T” pattern that is conspicuous in flight. Found in rocky areas with some trees and shrubs. White-bellied males can resemble other wheatears, but are distinguished by their black-and-buff tail. The song is a long, musical jumble of whistles and chatty notes."
0,Abyssinian Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Chloropicus abyssinicus,https://ebird.org/species/abywoo1,"A small, short-tailed woodpecker of the Abyssinian highlands. Note the pure golden-green back and the white facial streaks that frame a dark cheek. Males have a red cap and females a dark one. Found in montane woodland and open forest. Within its small range, most similar to Cardinal Woodpecker, but separated by the slightly larger size, the dark cheek, and the brighter yellow back. Quiet and inconspicuous, but sometimes gives a high, rattling call."
0,Acadian Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax virescens,https://ebird.org/species/acafly,"Small flycatcher with big peaked head and relatively long bill. Extremely similar to several other species, especially Alder and Willow Flycatchers. Greenish-olive above and pale whitish below. Note thin white eyering and very long wingtips. Best distinguished from other flycatchers by habitat and voice. Birds near the northern end of breeding range prefer shaded ravines with mix of hemlocks and deciduous trees; farther south, found in mature deciduous forests. Tends to stay high in the canopy.

0,Aceh Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus snouckaerti,https://ebird.org/species/orsbul2,"Rare and declining endemic of Sumatra’s northwestern mountains. Large grayish-brown bulbul with a bright orange forehead patch, dark olive wings, and a weak crest that gives it a pointy-headed profile. Once regarded as a subspecies of the very similar Orange-spotted Bulbul, but note present species’ distribution and dark (not white) belly. Inhabits foothill and lower montane forests, where localized and largely restricted to clearings with a substantial understory. Calls are generally similar to those of Orange-spotted Bulbul, and include a bubbly chatter."
0,Acorn Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes formicivorus,https://ebird.org/species/acowoo,"Medium-sized woodpecker with unique face pattern: red crown, pale yellowish forehead and throat, and pale eye. Otherwise glossy-black with streaky underparts. In flight, look for blazing white rump and wing patches.

The back and underparts are variably spotted and barred. The throat is gray in the male and white in the female. It swims slow and low in the water with its tail held on the surface. This secretive bird moves in pairs on perennial rivers, swamps, and quiet clear backwaters, foraging under overhanging cover for invertebrates, frogs, and fish. The short, thick neck and bright-colored bill and feet differentiate it from darters and cormorants."
0,African Firefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lagonosticta rubricata,https://ebird.org/species/afffin,"Small brown and reddish waxbill with a blue-gray bill and black under the tail. Varies geographically, but in many areas, has a mostly gray head. Found along forest edge and in cultivation, thick woodland, and scrub. Usually in pairs or small groups. Call is a short, low trill. Quiet song is a mix of low trills and much higher-pitched whines and whistles. Similar to Red-billed and Bar-breasted firefinches but shows black under the tail. Subspecies without gray on the head can be extremely similar to Jameson’s Firefinch, but they are darker and less pinkish overall."
0,African Fish-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Haliaeetus vocifer,https://ebird.org/species/affeag1,"The adult is a large, distinctive, chestnut-and-white eagle that sits prominently on perches near rivers, lakes, and other waterbodies. The scruffy immature is dark brown and mottled with white on head. In flight the white windows in the wings and pale, dark-tipped tail make the juvenile distinctive. It catches fish with a graceful, shallow plunge to the water’s surface, but it will also eat birds, reptiles, and carrion. It tosses its head backwards while making a loud penetrating “wheeee-ah-kleeuw-kleeuw-kluuu” call; it is one of the most distinctive bird sounds of Africa."
0,African Golden Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus auratus,https://ebird.org/species/afgori2,"Typical Old World oriole with mostly yellow plumage and a red bill.

0,African Jacana,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Jacanidae,Actophilornis africanus,https://ebird.org/species/afrjac1,"A distinctive chestnut, white, and black waterbird with a sky-blue bill and enormous feet. The immature lacks the blue bill and shield and is brown-headed. Resident and nomadic, this species trots on the surface of water lilies and other aquatic vegetation, using its long legs and ludicrously elongated toes to prevent it from sinking. It flies weakly, low over the water, with legs and toes dangling behind awkwardly, and calls with a honking repeated “kyaaan” and wheezy hurried “skreeeeeet’--most often in flight. Highly unusual mating system in which one dominant female maintains a harem of multiple males. After egg-laying, each male will raise a brood alone."
0,African Marsh-Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus ranivorus,https://ebird.org/species/afmhar1,"Large, brown, wetland harrier. Like all harriers, has long, slender wings and tail, and graceful, swooping flight. Found in and around marshes, swamps, and wet grasslands. Dark brown overall coloration separates it from all other harriers except female Eurasian Marsh-Harrier. African Marsh-Harrier can be identified by the presence of barring in the wings and tail, as well as by its darker head."
0,African Openbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Anastomus lamelligerus,https://ebird.org/species/afrope1,"A medium-sized, all-dark stork with a mostly greenish gloss and a uniquely-shaped bill that creates a diagnostic gap between the two halves of the bill. Its flight is slow and labored. The long neck and feet separate it from other dark waterbirds. It prefers still waters in shallow lakes, swamps, and seasonal pans, where it uses its odd bill to extract snails and mussels from their shells. A resident, migrant, and nomad; massive numbers can suddenly appear when conditions are favorable."
0,African Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus moquini,https://ebird.org/species/afroys1,"A plump, coastal shorebird that is glossy black in plumage with salmon-red legs and reddish eye, eye-ring, and bill. The juvenile is duller, with pink-brown bill and grayish-pink legs. Conspicuous on rocky coastlines and sandy shores, where it feeds on invertebrates like mussels, limpets, and worms. It is often first detected by its distinctive, high-pitched piping “pleek” and “peeka-peeka” alarm calls. Similar Eurasian Oystercatcher differs from African Oystercatcher by its white belly and throat."
0,African Palm-Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Cypsiurus parvus,https://ebird.org/species/afpswi1,"A very slender gray-brown swift with a long, deeply forked tail that is often held closed, making it look needle-like and pointed. The erratic flight pattern, with frequent direction changes and rapid wingbeats on long, scythe-shaped wings, is distinctive. Less gregarious than other swifts; usually found in pairs or small flocks, and association with other swallows and swifts is usually only fleeting. Forages over a wide variety of habitats with palms, including savanna, coastal scrub, towns, villages, cultivated areas, forest edge, and clearings, from sea level up to 1800 meters of elevation, preferring lowlands. Nests and roosts in palms and uses its tiny legs with hook-like claws to cling to the undersides of fronds. Gives a high-pitched, metallic “tre-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit” call, solitarily or in unison with others. Separated from other swifts by its longer and thinner tail."
0,African Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone viridis,https://ebird.org/species/afpfly1,"This remarkable flycatcher occurs in both rufous and white morphs, but it always has grayish underparts and a strong crest. The breeding male has ludicrous central tail feathers, twenty centimeters long, that trail like the ribbon of a rhythmic gymnast, while the female lacks the tail streamers and has a smaller crest. Singles and pairs occasionally join flocks in open woodland, riverine forest, and thickets, avoiding lowland evergreen forest. Very vocal, often giving a repeated grating “dzee-zwee” call and a sweet melodic “willie-willie-willie-wee-wooo” song. The very similar Rufous-vented Paradise-Flycatcher differs from African Paradise-Flycatcher by having a rufous undertail and a shorter crest."
0,African Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus demersus,https://ebird.org/species/jacpen1,"The only penguin regularly found within its range. A pudgy, flightless, black-and-white seabird with wings modified into flippers. Uncommon and declining, but still easily seen at well-known breeding colonies. It is extremely ungainly on land but is a supreme swimmer in the open ocean, where individuals dive down as far as 60 m in pursuit of small schooling fish. Juveniles are covered in flufflike down, and immatures have a white throat and frequently look scruffy as they molt. Call is a repeated, donkey-like braying: “haaaaaaahh, haaaaaaahh”."
0,African Piculet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Verreauxia africana,https://ebird.org/species/afrpic1,"A tiny woodpecker of forest and forest edge, more likely to be mistaken for a crombec than for another species of woodpecker. A squat bird with a round body, a large head, a short, stout bill, and a very short tail. Body is gray overall with greenish wings, white markings around the ears, and orange around the eyes. Males have an orange forehead. Voice is a weak trilling “si-si-si-si-si.”"
0,African Pied Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Lophoceros fasciatus,https://ebird.org/species/afphor1,"A small hornbill that is frequently encountered as it flies singly or in groups over the canopy, between forest gaps, and over road cuts. Distinctive, with a bright white belly and a black head, body, wings, and tail, giving it a bicolored appearance. The bill is pale yellow with a dark tip. Calls are a series of high-pitched whistles: “heu heu heu heu.”"
0,African Pied Wagtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Motacilla aguimp,https://ebird.org/species/afpwag1,"The only black-and-white wagtail in Africa shows a bold white eyebrow and wing panels and a broad black throat patch. The juvenile is brownish. Pairs and family groups frequent a broad range of habitats, including human-altered environments, but in drier areas they are associated with waterside habitats. The species runs on the ground foraging for insects, characteristically wagging its tail up and down in an exaggerated motion. The juvenile African Pied Wagtail may resemble the Cape Wagtail, but has extensive white panels in the wings."
0,African Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus cinnamomeus,https://ebird.org/species/afrpip1,"The default pipit across much of Africa. Brown above and pale below, with a streaked back, well-marked face, and white outer tail feathers. There is considerable geographic variation, from pale and sandy to rich brown and rufous. Found in a variety of open and usually grassy habitats, both near water and in dry areas. Call is a sneezing “tzsht”. Song comprises consecutive series of rattles, given in flight. Very similar to other pipits; some of the key features to look for include the yellow base of the bill, streaked back, and white outer tail feathers."
0,African Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Pitta angolensis,https://ebird.org/species/afrpit1,"An unusual and beautiful bird that is rarely seen, even by those expressly looking for it. Note the buffy underparts, green back, red undertail, and bold facial pattern. Found on the floor of forest and dense thicket. Very shy, remaining motionless for long periods. At least some populations are migratory within Africa. The call is an explosive, liquid “phwit.” Can only be confused with Green-breasted Pitta, but separated by the lack of a dark-green breast."
0,African Pygmy-Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Nettapus auritus,https://ebird.org/species/afrpyg1,"Colorful miniature waterfowl that is smaller than most ducks. Both sexes have rufous underparts, a dark back, white on the face, and white on the wing in flight. Males have a green patch on the back of the head and a yellow bill; females have a black-and-white head and a dark bill. Found in freshwater wetlands with floating vegetation, especially water lilies. Shy and inconspicuous, as it generally avoids open water. Voice is a high-pitched squeaking. Small size and bold and colorful plumage separate it from other waterfowl."
0,African Pygmy Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Ispidina picta,https://ebird.org/species/afpkin1,"Tiny, gem-like, woodland kingfisher. Note the orange face with a purple cheek mark and the narrow, dark blue crown. Found in the understory of woodland, thickets, and some forests. Inconspicuous bird that sits motionless for long periods before darting after prey. Call is a harsh “tsik,” often given in flight. Similar to Malachite Kingfisher, but smaller, has more orange on the face, and prefers upland habitats. Very similar to African Dwarf-Kingfisher, but pygmy-kingfisher has a dark crown."
0,African Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/afrrai1,"Classic, mid-sized rail. Note the brown back, gray head and chest, barred belly, and reddish bill and legs. Found in wetlands ranging from flooded grassland to deep swamps. Especially favors cattail marshes. Fairly reclusive but walks out into the open more often than most rails. Usually detected by call, a loud, accelerating series of notes that descend the scale. Shares a similar color pattern with African Crake, but African Rail has a longer bill and an unspotted back."
0,African Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus baeticatus,https://ebird.org/species/afrwar1,"A fairly small, plain and unstreaked warbler, brownish above and paler below. Very hard to distinguish from other reed warblers, although the relatively short, rounded wings are a useful feature. Song essentially identical to Eurasian Reed Warbler. Most safely identified on geographic range at seasons when migrant reed warbler species are absent. Largely restricted to marshy habitat, such as reed and sedge beds and the edges of papyrus, in addition to tall grass and bushes alongside rivers and ditches."
0,African River Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Pseudochelidon eurystomina,https://ebird.org/species/afrmar2,"Enigmatic and distinctive, this compact all-dark martin has striking red eyes and a bright orange-red bill. Juvenile is duller. In lethargic flight it appears bulky-headed, short-tailed, and triangular-winged. Small to large groups forage high over forested rivers, swamps, and coastal scrub. Birds migrate between two breeding areas, one in coastal central Africa from Gabon to northern Angola (August to December), and another farther inland, centered on the Congo River in west-central Democratic Republic of Congo (January to May), but their habits remain poorly understood. Calls include a scratchy chattering “skeer-skeer”; large flocks can become cacophonous."
0,African Sacred Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Threskiornis aethiopicus,https://ebird.org/species/sacibi2,"Striking white ibis with a naked black head and neck and black legs and feet. White wings framed by black wingtips and trailing edges. Can be encountered in almost any open habitat from wild wetlands to farmland and rubbish dumps. Originally restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, but now established in Taiwan and Europe, with feral colonies in France, Italy, and Spain."
0,African Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/afsowl1,"A small, compact, gray-brown owl with small ear tufts. It occupies moist woodland and arid savanna, provided there are trees with cavities for nesting. Its supreme wooden-stump-like camouflage keeps it well hidden during the day. At night a unique croaking frog-like “prreeeuup” call is repeated every 5–8 seconds, sometimes for long periods, and is the easiest way to track it down."
0,African Silverbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Euodice cantans,https://ebird.org/species/afrsil1,"A small, slender finch found in savanna, grasslands, fields, and thorn scrub. Cream-colored below and brown above with darker wings, a long, dark tail, and a thick silvery-gray bill. The tail is longer and more pointed than in other small finches. Often seen in flocks in semiarid savanna and plains, agricultural areas, and marshes. Male call is a metallic “tink” or “tsip”; female’s is a double note. Song is a peaking series of notes ending in a trill. Native to Africa; introduced to the Hawaiian Islands."
0,African Skimmer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Rynchops flavirostris,https://ebird.org/species/afrski1,"Distinctive tern-like bird with long wings, a short tail, and a bizarre bill in which the upper mandible is shorter than the lower mandible. In slow flight, shows a very white underwing and a white stripe along the back of the upperwing. Feeds by skimming its knife-like lower mandible through the water and snapping up small fish that it makes contact with. Found very locally on sandbars in lakes and rivers. Call is a husky “chep.”"
0,African Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago nigripennis,https://ebird.org/species/afrsni1,"Chunky, cryptic, short-legged, long-billed shorebird. In flight, shows much white on the outer tail and underwing. Found in thickly vegetated wetlands. Restricted to middle and high elevations across the majority of its range. Most often seen when it flushes explosively, often giving a rough “shrik” call. Display vocalization is a long accelerating series of “kik” notes, followed by a hollow booming made by the outer tail in flight display. Similar to Common Snipe, but darker and with much white in the outer tail. Also easily confused with the uncommon Great Snipe, but African is paler, lacks strong bars on the wing, and has a white rather than dark underwing."
0,African Spoonbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Platalea alba,https://ebird.org/species/afrspo1,"A distinctive pale waterbird with long pink-red legs, a bare bright pink-red face, and an odd and distinctive spoon-shaped bill that is obvious even in flight. The juvenile lacks the bright pink-red skin and has black tipped wings in flight. It breeds colonially in heronries. The African Spoonbill prefers large, quiet, shallow waterbodies where it forages by swinging its head from side-to-side, slicing its bill through the water, searching for small fish and aquatic invertebrates. It is mostly nomadic, wandering in response to local rainfall."
0,African Spotted Creeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Certhiidae,Salpornis salvadori,https://ebird.org/species/spocre2,"Although it is in a different family from the treecreepers, this species has typical creeper structure and behavior. The intricately spotted and barred plumage is gray-brown and white. Generally uncommon and local in a variety of moist woodland types, including miombo and Guinea savanna. Creeps its way up a tree, then flies down to start up another tree. The song is a quiet, high-pitched, up-and-down series of “seet” calls."
0,African Stonechat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Saxicola torquatus,https://ebird.org/species/afrsto1,"Small, chunky robin-like bird. Males are black and white, with a variable amount of rufous on the underparts. Ethiopian population has a black chest and no red. Females are dark brown on the back and pale below. Both sexes show a variable white wing patch. Found in a wide variety of open habitats, including grassland, heath, marsh, and scrub. Perches up conspicuously. Song is a quick jumbled mix of musical and raspy notes. Similar to the migratory Whinchat, but lacks conspicuous white eye-stripe, and shows white on the rump rather than the base of the tail."
0,African Swamphen,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Porphyrio madagascariensis,https://ebird.org/species/purswa2,"When seen in good light, shows spectacular purple, green, and pale blue coloration. In dull light, looks dark, but still shows red bill and feet and white undertail. Found in freshwater and brackish wetlands with thick vegetation, mainly at low and middle elevations. Gives a loud trumpeting call. Coloration similar to Allen’s Gallinule, but chunkier and larger, with a much larger bill. Larger than Eurasian Moorhen, with brighter coloration, red legs, and no yellow tip to the bill."

Note the orange bill and bare skin around the eye, and the white throat with black striping. Found in the thick undergrowth of a variety of habitats, including dry thorn savanna, scrub, and woodland. Fairly shy and retiring. There is only minor overlap in range with similar thrushes, such as African Thrush and Kurrichane Thrush, and in those areas, African Bare-eyed Thrush is easily identified by the bare skin around the eye. One common call is a short, low-pitched trill, and the song is a low-pitched combination of chatty whistles and trills, with frequent pauses."
0,African Wood-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix woodfordii,https://ebird.org/species/afwowl1,"Chunk brown mid-sized owl. Has a big, round head without ear tufts, heavy barring below, and white crescents on the face. Varies geographically from being dark brown to pale rufous-brown. Found in thick woodland, forest, gardens, and plantations. Male gives a long, rising “hu-wuuuuu” call, and both sexes give a gruff up-and-down series (“hu-ho-hu-ho-ho-ho”), often in duet. Larger than owlets, and lacks the ear tufts of eagle-owls."
0,African Yellow-Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Iduna natalensis,https://ebird.org/species/afywar1,"Mid-sized, long-billed warbler with rich yellow underparts and an olive-green back. The color of the cap varies geographically. In some subspecies, it is black, while in others, it is olive-green like the back. Found in wet scrub, often adjacent to wetlands. Generally skulks in thick undergrowth. Distinctive song is a couple of quick introductory chips followed by a vibrating trill. Other yellow-warblers are similar, but have a paler cap and are found in different habitats."
0,Agami Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Agamia agami,https://ebird.org/species/agaher1,"Reclusive, rarely seen heron of humid tropical lowlands. Found along quiet forest streams and locally in mangroves. Walks slowly and stealthily hunting from the water’s edge or a low overhanging branch. Note the very long and slender, dagger-tipped bill.

0,Ainley's Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates cheimomnestes,https://ebird.org/species/leastp2,"Rare and poorly known seabird found in the Pacific Ocean well off the coast of Mexico. It breeds in the winter on small islets near Guadalupe Island, located 160 miles from the mainland, and disperses southward during other times of the year. Plumage is dark gray with a notched tail, white rump patch, and pale stripes on the upperwing. The rump patch is variable in extent, and on some birds may be split down the middle by gray feathers. Identification is extremely difficult due to its similarity with other species, especially Townsend’s Storm-Petrel and Leach’s Storm-Petrel. Remains at sea when not breeding; flies erratically and often patters the ocean with its feet."
0,Alagoas Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula snowi,https://ebird.org/species/alaant1,"Very rare antwren, unmistakable in its tiny range, likely now restricted to one complex of humid forest fragments in the Brazilian state of Alagoas. Males are gray with a blackish throat and females are cinnamon-colored. Forages in the understory and middle levels of the forest, usually accompanying remnant mixed-species flocks. The song is a high sharp series of whistles."
0,Alagoas Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Mitu mitu,https://ebird.org/species/alacur1,"This impressive bird is found only in northeastern Brazil rainforest, and it is perilously close to extinction. Since the mid-eighties there have been no records of wild birds, and the species has only persisted in private aviaries. In 2019, several captive-raised birds were released into a reserve in the state of Alagoas as the first step in an ambition reintroduction program, but it remains to be seen if they will be able to survive and reproduce on their own. It is large and mostly glossy black, with chestnut lower underparts, red legs, and a bulbous, red bill. It is mostly terrestrial, but occasionally ascends to low branches."
0,Alagoas Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phylloscartes ceciliae,https://ebird.org/species/alatyr1,"Small flycatcher with a long tail, which is often held cocked. Has an olive back and whitish underparts. Note the two yellow wingbars and the white eyebrow.

0,Albert's Lyrebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Menuridae,Menura alberti,https://ebird.org/species/alblyr1,"A large brown bird with very long tail; the male’s is said to be lyre-shaped. These curved outer tail feathers are absent in juveniles and females, which can be mistaken for Superb Lyrebird, but location and underpart coloration (rusty tones in Albert’s) help in ID. Found in rainforests, where it forages in leaf litter for food. Usually heard before it is seen, it has a very powerful song and is known for mimicking other species. Note range, as this species is found only in a small region of Queensland and far northeast New South Wales."
0,Albertine Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium albertinum,https://ebird.org/species/albowl1,"Chunky brownish owlet. Shows bars and spots on the underparts and fine spotting on the nape and top of the head. Rare and enigmatic bird known from a small number of records in Albertine Rift montane forest. Gives a yelping series of “kow” notes, which are usually followed by emphatic, modulated, descending “ptrrrrr” notes. Very similar to African Barred Owlet, but has spotting rather than barring on top of the head, and a buff rather than white slash across the shoulder."

Found in all habitats with bushes and trees on the remote Seychelles island of Aldabra, including forest, mangroves, and thick scrub. Perches prominently in the open, swooping out to catch insects on the wing. Often follows Madagascar Coucals and Aldabra Giant Tortoises, feeding on insects that they disturb. Song is a repeated sequence of whistles, creaks, and rasps."
0,Aldabra Fody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia aldabrana,https://ebird.org/species/rehfod3,"A sparrow-like weaver. The mostly scarlet, yellow-bellied breeding males are distinctive, but females and non-breeding males are drab. Found in scrub, mangroves, and woodland on the island of Aldabra in the Seychelles. Similar to Red Fody, which recently reached Aldabra, and they have hybridized. Breeding males easily separated by their yellow belly. Females and non-breeding males very similar to those plumages of Red Fody, but can be cautiously separated by a stronger yellow wash, especially on the underparts and head. Calls are high, silvery notes, given in long series as a song."
0,Alder Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax alnorum,https://ebird.org/species/aldfly,"Small flycatcher, extremely similar to several other species. Prefers clearings and boggy areas, often with patches of alders. Grayish-olive above and pale below with thin white eyering. Wings dark with bold white wingbars. Nearly identical to Willow Flycatcher; once considered the same species. Also compare with Least Flycatcher, which is very similar but has slightly shorter wingtips and a bolder eyering. Best identified by voice: song is a rolling, rough ""freeBEER;"" call is a clear ""pip."" Silent birds, especially in migration, often best left unidentified."
0,Aleutian Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Onychoprion aleuticus,https://ebird.org/species/aleter1,"Beautiful, elegant tern of the Pacific Ocean. Breeding adults are silvery-gray overall with a black cap and crisp white forehead. Bill and legs are black.

In dull light, looks dark, but still shows red bill and feet, pale blue forehead shield, and white undertail. Juveniles are pale brown. Found in freshwater wetlands with thick vegetation, especially water lilies. Inconspicuous and shy, and will rarely emerge for long from thick cover. Call is a mournful wailing. Similar in coloration to African Swamphen, but slimmer and smaller, with a much smaller bill. Also similar to Eurasian Moorhen, but slimmer and smaller, with brighter coloration, red legs, and no yellow tip to the bill."
0,Allen's Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Selasphorus sasin,https://ebird.org/species/allhum,"Extremely similar to widespread Rufous Hummingbird; identical in plumage except for males' solid green back (which can be shown by Rufous too.) Breeds only along a narrow strip of coastal California and southern Oregon. See also: Rufous Hummingbird. On females and immature males, the only way to separate them from Rufous is by the shape of the tail feathers, which is extremely difficult to determine without good photographs."
0,Allpahuayo Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Percnostola arenarum,https://ebird.org/species/allant1,"Scarce antbird described to science in 2001. It is found in lowland rainforest in northeastern Peru, only in areas with white, sandy soil. Male is gray with a black throat and white wingbars. Female has gray upperparts with tawny underparts and wingbars. Very similar to Black-headed Antbird, and best identified by voice, range, and habitat. Inhabits dense understory, often in areas with lots of palm saplings. Song is a fairly rapid series of ringing notes, higher-pitched and faster than the song of Black-headed Antbird."

Greenish-brown with a bright yellow brow stripe and underparts. Lacks wingbars. Tickell’s has a paler throat and belly, as well as a slightly longer and straighter brow stripe. As the name indicates, this is a warbler of high-altitude areas, breeding in open areas with low vegetation. Wintering birds descend, often into scrubby patches, gardens, and forest edges. Song is an explosive burst of repetitive chittering notes, sharper-sounding than that of Tickell’s. Call is a dry “chit”."
0,Alpine Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus gutturalis,https://ebird.org/species/alppip1,"A medium-sized bird of Alpine Grasslands. Brown upperparts with faintly streaked back and crown, dark wing feathers with pale edges, cream to pale buff underparts and a broad pale eyebrow. Prefers short grass with bushes nearby. Similar to Australasian Pipit but Alpine is larger, found at higher elevations and has buffy underparts and unstreaked chest. A rich and varied song. Several whistled notes are given before changing to the next set with different pitch, tone, sometimes rising or falling."
0,Alpine Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus melba,https://ebird.org/species/alpswi1,"Spectacular and distinctive large swift, noticeably larger than Common Swift and Blyth’s Swift, but with slower wingbeats and a ""lazier"" and wider soaring flight. Dark brown overall with white belly; at close range, white throat patch is visible. Breeds colonially in cliff faces, mountains, larger buildings. Migratory in parts of its range."
0,Alpine Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera mollissima,https://ebird.org/species/alpthr1,"Chocolate-brown thrush with finely scaled white underparts. Very similar to Himalayan and Sichuan Thrushes, with which it was once considered a single species. Alpine is shorter-billed than the other two species, with a darker brown forehead than Sichuan Thrush; averages longer-legged and longer-winged than Himalayan Thrush. Long-tailed Thrush can also be similar, but lacks Alpine’s intense throat and chest speckling, and has thin but prominent pale wingbars. Alpine Thrush breeds in open rocky alpine areas with scattered shrubbery between 3000 and 4500 meters of elevation, though it descends lower into the foothills during winter. Song is simple but not altogether unmusical, consisting of fluid warbling notes and squeaky grating ones."
0,Alström's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus soror,https://ebird.org/species/pltwar1,"Sprightly, small warbler that poses a bevy of identification issues. Dull olive above and yellow below, with a bright eyering and a gray crown bound in by black stripes. Extremely similar to closely-related Martens’s, Gray-crowned, White-spectacled, and Bianchi’s Warblers; often impossible to identify if seen poorly in where range overlap is possible. Weak or absent wingbar distinguishes this species from Whistler’s, Bianchi’s, and White-spectacled warblers. Slightly larger-billed and shorter-tailed and with more restricted white in outer tail feathers than Martens’s and Gray-crowned warblers. Breeding altitudinal range (600–1500 m) can be helpful: does not overlap with higher-breeding Bianchi’s Warbler (1760–3100 m in China) and minutely with Martens’s Warbler (1200–2300 m). Overlap more extensive with Gray-crowned Warbler (120–1830 m in China) and White-spectacled Warbler (1000–1750 m in China). Simple, short song can be an identification clincher: a brief “che-witchy-chew-witchy-chew”, lacking the trilled notes of Martens’s, Gray-crowned, and White-spectacled warbler, and higher in pitch than Bianchi’s Warbler. Forages low, often in dense growth, of temperate evergreen forests, descending during the non-breeding season into forested lowlands, where overlap with non-singing similar species can make identification nearly impossible."
0,Alta Floresta Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Hylopezus whittakeri,https://ebird.org/species/alfant1,"Secretive species, almost tailless with long legs. Has a black-spotted breast, white throat, and conspicuous buff “goggles”. Found in humid forest with relatively dense undergrowth, where it moves quietly on the forest floor. Often perches on horizontal dead logs when singing its melancholy series of typically five whistles."
0,Altai Accentor,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Prunellidae,Prunella himalayana,https://ebird.org/species/himacc1,"Gray-brown overall with orange streaks on the breast and a white throat bordered by a thin black outline. Similar to Alpine Accentor, but darker and more extensively streaked. A common inhabitant of rocky alpine plateaus, meadows, and mountain slopes. Typically forages singly, but is often found in high numbers around campsites and towns where they scrounge for scraps."
0,Altai Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus altaicus,https://ebird.org/species/altsno1,"A burly brown inhabitant of high mountain passes, meadows, and plains, ranging from the low foothills up to isolated snowy peaks. The only snowcock throughout most of its range; minimal overlap with Himalayan Snowcock in far northwestern China and extreme northeastern Kazakhstan. Heavy contrast between the pale brown head and neck, white belly, and dark-brown-and-white back are unmistakable even from a distance and in poor weather conditions."
0,Altamira Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus gularis,https://ebird.org/species/altori,"Large bright orange oriole with thick dark bill, found in open shrubby woodland. Limited black on face and throat; black back and wings with white wingbar and orange shoulder patch. Young birds duller yellow. Most similar to Hooded Oriole but larger and stockier with orange shoulder patch and thicker bill. Song is a series of sweet, clear whistles like many other orioles, but slower with a more deliberate, even pattern. Visits fruit feeders."
0,Altamira Yellowthroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Geothlypis flavovelata,https://ebird.org/species/altyel1,"Brightly plumaged yellowthroat, restricted to northeast Mexico. Favors reed beds and adjacent marshy vegetation around lakes and ponds, also locally in cane fields. Common Yellowthroat is a common migrant throughout range of Altamira and is usually more numerous. Altamira is brighter yellow overall than Common. Male has yellowish border to black mask and extensively yellow underparts. Female is brighter and more extensively yellow on face and underparts than Common, but can be difficult to distinguish."
0,Amami Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera major,https://ebird.org/species/scathr6,"Large thrush, pale brown above, white below, with scale-like black-tipped feathers throughout the plumage. Inhabits undisturbed broadleaf evergreen forests of low elevations. Once considered a subspecies of White’s Thrush but now recognized as an endemic species of Amami and Kakeroma Islands. Amami Thrush is duller overall than White’s, which may appear during migration in the habitat of Amami. When foraging, Amami runs like a plover, stopping suddenly to listen for prey, whereas White’s walks along strangely, bobbing the head. Amami Thrush’s song distinctive and complex, very different from the simple song of White’s."
0,Amami Woodcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Scolopax mira,https://ebird.org/species/amawoo1,"Furtive, large, ground-dwelling shorebird endemic to the broadleaf forests of northern Okinawa Island and the Amami Islands. Similar to Eurasian Woodcock but darker overall, with notably longer legs and a thicker bill base. Patch of bare pinkish skin around the eye is diagnostic but absent in winter. Black bands on the top of the head not as thick and conspicuous as in Eurasian, which is a winter visitor. Like other woodcocks, displays both on the ground and in circular aerial displays. Flushes slowly and directly ahead."
0,Amani Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Hedydipna pallidigaster,https://ebird.org/species/amasun2,"A small sunbird with a short, slightly curved bill. Males are dark above and bright white below with an iridescent blue-green head and chest. Females are gray above and white below with an indistinct white eyebrow. Found very locally in forest and lush woodland at low elevations, mostly in the canopy. Female is similar to female violet-backed sunbirds, but is separated by the smaller size and the lack of a yellow wash on the underparts. The most distinctive vocalization is a two-part “twee-tree,” but also gives typical jumbled sunbird song."
0,Amazilia Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilis amazilia,https://ebird.org/species/amahum1,"A green-and-chestnut hummingbird with plumage that varies throughout its range. All variants have a red bill with a black tip. In most of its range, it has a green throat, white breast, and chestnut belly and tail. In the southern part of its range, white breast is reduced or absent and throat is blue or blue-green. At its northern limit, tail is mostly green. In the Andes of southern Ecuador, underparts are mostly white with only a little chestnut. Common in dry forest and scrub, and less prevalent or absent in more humid areas."
0,Amazon Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Chloroceryle amazona,https://ebird.org/species/amakin1,"Medium-sized kingfisher of tropical lowlands. Found singly or in pairs, along rivers and at the edges of ponds and lakes, often perched on wires or bare snags. Mainly flies low over the water. Size similar to Belted Kingfisher, but black bill much more massive and crest more tufted. Also differs from Belted in its dark oily-green head and upperparts. Green Kingfisher is much smaller with bold white spots and bars on the wings."
0,Amazonian Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Myrmothera berlepschi,https://ebird.org/species/amaant1,"Lowland rainforest antpitta of secondary growth. Typical antpitta shape, with long legs, almost no tail, and a plump body. Light brown above, white with diffuse brown streaking below, and a tawny wash on the face and breast. Lighter and more orangey than the similar Thrush-like Antpitta, which prefers more mature forest habitat. Does not have a strong facial pattern like other lowland antpittas. Secretive and difficult to see; listen for its song, a series of 3-5 loud “coop” notes."
0,Amazonian Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus amazonicus,https://ebird.org/species/amaant2,"Medium-sized, sluggish bird of tall rainforest. Males mostly gray and black; females very different, with dull to bright cinnamon head and breast, which can aid identification since this species generally occurs in pairs. Often found along river edges and in areas with much vine growth in the mid-story. Hops slowly through vegetation, searching for insects; found alone or with mixed-species flocks. Told from other antshrikes by song and brightly colored female; males have more extensive white wing markings than most other antshrikes. Song is a rapid series of notes with a trogon-like quality."
0,Amazonian Barred-Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Dendrocolaptes certhia,https://ebird.org/species/amabaw1,"Large reddish brown woodcreeper of lowland rainforest. Lightly barred from face to back and underparts; this barring can be quite diffuse and sometimes difficult to see in the field. Average-sized bill can be brown to dark red, depending on the population. A faint dark cheek pattern can often be seen. Similar to some other large unstreaked woodcreepers; weak pattern of horizontal barring and dark brown or red (not gray) bill help differentiate from Cinnamon-throated, Plain-brown, and White-chinned Woodcreepers. Prefers mature forest habitats, and is frequently found singly or in pairs around army ant swarms. Voice is a quick descending series of whistles, shorter and more quickly descending than Black-banded."
0,Amazonian Black-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Knipolegus poecilocercus,https://ebird.org/species/ambtyr1,"A rarely-encountered medium-sized dark flycatcher, most often found in flooded forests along rivers. Both males and females similar to the related Riverside Tyrant, but that species prefers more open habitat. Male Amazonian Black-Tyrant is shiny-black, smaller and glossier than male Riverside. Female Amazonian are warm brown with streaked underparts, considerably warmer in coloration than female Riverside. Notably quiet for a flycatcher."
0,Amazonian Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Cyanoloxia rothschildii,https://ebird.org/species/bubgro2,"Chunky, stout-billed bird of humid evergreen forest and edge in tropical lowlands. Occurs from throughout much of the Amazon basin (east of the Andes). Usually found in pairs, often skulking at low to middle levels in lush vegetation. In typical views, looks simply dark. Note the very stout bill and broad tail, which can be twitched side to side. Male is deep blue-black overall. Female is rich dark brown overall. Sharp squeaky call often doubled and rather distinctive."
0,Amazonian Motmot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Momotidae,Momotus momota,https://ebird.org/species/bucmot4,"Medium-sized motmot. Green with orange underparts, black mask, and blue crown. Other motmots in its range have orange heads. Found in the under and midstory of a variety of forest habitats, including humid forest, semi-humid forest, and forest edge. It often sits quietly on exposed perches, wagging its tail from side to side. Listen for its song, a low “BOO-boop” with the emphasis on the first syllable; often heard around dawn and dusk."
0,Amazonian Pygmy-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium hardyi,https://ebird.org/species/amapyo1,"Tiny owl of Amazonian lowlands. Found in a variety of habitats, including forest edges and mature rainforest. Gray head contrasts against broad reddish brown streaks down its white belly. Round head without ear tufts and largely white undersides distinguish it from screech-owls. Similar to larger Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl, but has a smaller, grayer head, and is less finely streaked. Also note vocal differences; Amazonian Pygmy-owl call is a rapid, slightly descending series of toots too fast to imitate. Sings mostly around dawn and dusk, but also sometimes during the day and at night."
0,Amazonian Scrub-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Sublegatus obscurior,https://ebird.org/species/amsfly1,"A confusing flycatcher, fairly small and nondescript. Look for the short bill and round head, sometimes raised into a slight crest. Dull grayish-brown head shows only a hint of a paler line above eye. Chest is paler gray, which blends into the pale yellow belly. Wingbars are present but not bold. Larger and lankier than a beardless-tyrannulet; looks rather like a diminutive Myiarchus flycatcher. Very similar to Southern Scrub-Flycatcher, which may overlap during the Austral winter, but note the overall darker coloration of Amazonian."
0,Amazonian Streaked-Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula multostriata,https://ebird.org/species/amasta1,"Small streaked antwren of riparian habitats. Males are white with black streaking; females are similar but with an extensive reddish wash. Tail very short in both sexes. Usually found in waterside vegetation around still or slow-moving water bodies like streams and lakes, where it forages low in vegetation overhanging the water. Gives two main songs: an even-pitched, accelerating trill of musical notes, and a slow ascending-descending series of whistled notes. The latter is one of the most characteristic bird sounds around oxbow lakes in Amazonia."
0,Amazonian Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Trogon ramonianus,https://ebird.org/species/viotro3,"Small yellow-bellied trogon of mature rainforest. Males are green with a blue head and breast and yellow eye ring, females dark gray with a broken white eye ring. Both sexes have yellow belly. Found in a variety of forested habitats, but usually a fairly uncommon species; most common in mature upland rainforest. Song is an even series of high “whew” notes, often sounding vaguely disyllabic, “whe-ew”; usually higher pitched and less breathy than Black-tailed."
0,Amazonian Umbrellabird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Cephalopterus ornatus,https://ebird.org/species/amaumb1,"Fantastic bird of the Amazonian region and adjacent Andean slopes. It looks like a huge crow with a bushy crest, a thick braid hanging from its throat, and pale eyes. Male is larger than female, with a longer (feathered) wattle and a white patch at the front of his crest. Flight is undulating and woodpecker-like. Inhabits tall rainforest, often along rivers, and males gather at display sites where they extend their wattles and give low pitched moos."
0,Ameline Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus amelis,https://ebird.org/species/palswi2,"Medium-sized brownish swiftlet with a weakly forked tail. Found only in the Philippine lowlands. Typically encountered alone or in loose groups over various open habitats, often soaring high. Fairly uniform brown plumage, lack of a pale rump, and size distinguish this species from most others in the area; Philippine Swiftlet is the most similar but is smaller, has a more square-tipped tail, and generally favors higher elevations (typically 700 meters and above)."
0,American Avocet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Recurvirostra americana,https://ebird.org/species/ameavo,"Distinctive large shorebird with a long, thin, upturned bill. Look for bold black-and-white wings and long blue-gray legs. Breeding adults have buffy-orange wash on head and neck; grayish in winter. Females have more sharply upturned bills than males. Widespread and fairly common in North America, although rare or absent from much of the eastern U.S. Usually seen in flocks, sometimes numbering into the hundreds, foraging in shallow wetlands or estuaries. Feeds by swinging its head back-and-forth through the water to catch small invertebrates."
0,American Bittern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Botaurus lentiginosus,https://ebird.org/species/amebit,"Stocky, brown heron found in marshes and bogs. Usually secretive and difficult to see, but occasionally found in the open. Most similar to juvenile night-herons. Note striped neck, plain unspotted wings, and even more secretive behavior of bittern. Most active around dawn and dusk, when it might be seen flying low over extensive marshes. Listen for its incredible vocalization in the spring and summer: a resonant, booming noise produced by air sacs on the neck, “oonk-GA-loonk.” Also gives single low squawks."
0,American Black Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas rubripes,https://ebird.org/species/ambduc,"A large duck, nearly identical to Mallard in size and shape but with a much darker chocolate-colored body. Bill is yellow with a slight greenish tinge on males, dull grayish-green on females. Note blue wing patch lacks any white borders. Fairly common in northeastern North America, especially along the coast. Large flocks can gather in the winter in saltmarshes and estuaries, but also occurs in smaller numbers on ponds and lakes, often mixed with other duck species. Frequently hybridizes with Mallard. Hybrids usually look darker than typical Mallards and may have an intermediate head pattern; also look for white in the tail or curled feathers above the tail to indicate Mallard genes."
0,American Coot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Fulica americana,https://ebird.org/species/y00475,"Plump, chicken-like bird that acts like a duck. Gray overall with blacker head and white bill. Tiny tail and short wings. Feet are large, yellow-green, and oddly lobed. Head jerks back and forth when swimming. Forages for aquatic vegetation anywhere with water: ponds, city parks, marshes, reservoirs, lakes, ditches, and saltmarshes."
0,American Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus brachyrhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/amecro,"This is the common crow over much of the U.S. and Canada. Most easily identified by voice, a familiar “caw,” often repeated. Common in any open habitats, including fields, open woodlands, marshes, and cities, thriving around humans. Very social, usually seen in flocks, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. Aggressive, sometimes seen chasing away hawks and owls. Separated from ravens by smaller size, smaller bill, shorter tail, and shorter, broader wings. Compare with Fish Crow, which is extremely similar in appearance, and best separated by voice. Includes the species formerly known as Northwestern Crow."
0,American Dipper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cinclidae,Cinclus mexicanus,https://ebird.org/species/amedip,"All-dark passerine that inhabits only fast-moving rocky streams in the West, from Alaska to Panama. Slaty gray overall with browner head. Forages for invertebrates by walking underwater. Unique shape, behavior, and strict habitat preferences make dipper unlikely to be confused with other species. Often nests under bridges."
0,American Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus ruber,https://ebird.org/species/grefla2,"Unmistakable but very local wading bird with very long, ‘coat-hanger’ neck and very long legs. Adult is hot pink, but 1st-year birds are brown and white overall, attaining fully adult colors in 2-3 years. Usually found in flocks in shallow, saline lagoons. Flamingoes fly in straggling lines, much like geese, and their honking and braying calls can also sound rather like geese. Beware that many people use ‘flamingo’ for Roseate Spoonbill, another (much more widespread) pink wading bird, which other than color is very differently shaped than a flamingo."
0,American Golden-Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Pluvialis dominica,https://ebird.org/species/amgplo,"Slender, long-winged plover usually found in relatively dry habitats. Breeding plumage shows black belly and face, white neck sides, and dark back and crown spangled with gold. Note sides and undertail coverts entirely black, but beware females and molting birds can be mottled with some white. Nonbreeding plumage is much drabber; grayish overall with distinct white eyebrow and dark cap. Juveniles are crisp and neatly spangled above, washed with gold on the upperparts. At all seasons, note slender shape and narrow bill to separate from Black-bellied Plover, along with grayish underwing in flight. Extremely similar to Pacific Golden-Plover; American is slightly longer-winged, shorter-legged, and smaller-billed, but these features are difficult to judge. Juvenile American is usually duller than Pacific, especially on the face and neck. Average habitat preferences are important (Pacific Golden and Black-bellied more regular on beaches and mudflats), but much overlap. Range is also important. Breeds on Arctic tundra. Fairly common migrant through central North America, uncommon on East Coast, rare on Pacific Coast. During migration, prefers sod fields, dry mudflats, and pastures; often in small flocks, sometimes mixed with Black-bellied Plover. Winters in South America. Note voice: a plaintive “pleedoo” call."
0,American Goldfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Spinus tristis,https://ebird.org/species/amegfi,"Small finch. Sharply pointed bill is pink in summer, grayish-brown in winter. Small head, long wings, and short, notched tail. Adult males in spring and summer are bright yellow with black forehead and wings. Females are dull yellow below and olive above with two distinct wingbars. In winter, they are drab, buffy-brown. Active and acrobatic. Sometimes in large numbers at feeders or on ground below. Found in weedy fields, cultivated areas, roadsides, orchards, and backyards."
0,American Kestrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco sparverius,https://ebird.org/species/amekes,"Petite falcon roughly the same size as Mourning Dove, but with a larger head and wider tail. In flight, note long, narrow wings and square-tipped tail. Often seen perched on telephone wires, along roadsides, in open country with short vegetation and few trees. From a perch or hovering, they usually drop to the ground to snatch small mammals and insects. Nests in cavities. Widespread across the Americas."
0,American Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus palliatus,https://ebird.org/species/ameoys,"Large, bulky shorebird with thick red bill. Unmistakable, striking plumage. Exclusively coastal; favors beaches where it feeds on shellfish and other invertebrates; less frequent in rocky areas. Gathers in flocks during migration and winter. Listen for loud yelps and whistles, often in a rapid series when excited. Hybrids with Black Oystercatcher occur locally in southern California and Baja; look for messy spotting where the black hood meets the white belly (sometimes very limited but often quite extensive)."
0,American Pygmy Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Chloroceryle aenea,https://ebird.org/species/ampkin1,"Tiny kingfisher of shady forest streams and mangroves. Often darts away when disturbed, but can be confiding if approached quietly and usually perches fairly low over the water. About half of the size of Green Kingfisher, and easily distinguished by rusty underparts and poorly contrasting pale neck collar (bright white on Green Kingfisher). Female has a narrow green breast band, lacking on male."
0,American Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga ruticilla,https://ebird.org/species/amered,"Adult males are striking and distinctive: mostly glossy black with bright orange flashes on the wings, tail, and sides. Females and young males are duller gray and olive with yellow patches instead of orange. Habitually flicks and fans tail while foraging for insects. Breeds in mature deciduous forests, often near water. Migrants can be found in any wooded habitat. Fairly extensive winter range throughout most of Middle America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Song is extremely variable."
0,American Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus migratorius,https://ebird.org/species/amerob,"Fairly large songbird with round body, long legs, and longish tail. Gray above with warm orange underparts and blackish head. Hops across lawns and stands erect with its bill often tilted upward. In fall and winter, forms large flocks and gathers in trees to roost or eat berries. Common across North America in gardens, parks, yards, golf courses, fields, pastures, and many other wooded habitats."
0,American Tree Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Spizelloides arborea,https://ebird.org/species/amtspa,"Hardy northern sparrow with plump body, small bill and long, thin tail. Note rusty cap and rusty (not black) eyeline, gray head and unstreaked grayish breast with dark smudge in center. Small flocks hop on ground, foraging for seeds, giving a soft, musical twitter. In winter, look for them in weedy fields with shrubs, forest edges, and marshes. Readily visit backyards. Rarely seen south of northern Canada in summer."
0,American White Pelican,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Pelecanidae,Pelecanus erythrorhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/amwpel,"Extremely large and conspicuous. White with black wingtips. Very long, orange bill with pouch for scooping up fish. Forages in flocks, swimming together to concentrate fish. Often soars in flocks, infrequently flapping, during migration and when traveling between feeding sites."
0,American Wigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mareca americana,https://ebird.org/species/amewig,"Breeding males have obvious white blaze on forehead and broad green slash behind eye. Females are plainer brown with rusty sides. Females are very difficult to distinguish from female Eurasian Wigeon; note colder grayish-brown head on American that contrasts with warmer orangey sides. Also look for brighter white, not gray, underwings in flight, but this can be difficult to judge, especially at a distance. Widespread and common in North America, occasionally wintering as far south as northern South America. Typically in flocks on lakes and wetlands, often grazing in nearby fields. Regular vagrant to Europe."
0,American Woodcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Scolopax minor,https://ebird.org/species/amewoo,"Plump, well-camouflaged shorebird that favors wooded or shrubby areas, usually near open fields. Plain buffy-salmon belly distinctive; also note intricately patterned upperparts with broad gray stripes down the back. Goofy-looking expression with huge dark eye placed high and far back on head. Extremely long bill used to probe the ground for worms. When flushed from dense cover, listen for high-pitched wing twittering and note rotund shape and long bill. Might be confused with Wilson’s Snipe, but woodcock is not nearly as dark and patterned. Fairly common throughout eastern North America, but secretive and rarely seen well in daytime. Always on the ground, except during well-known elaborate courtship display performed from dusk to dawn in spring. Listen for loud nasal “PEENT!” calls from the ground and high-pitched chirps and twitters (produced by the outer wing feathers) from high in the sky."
0,Amethyst Brown-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Phapitreron amethystinus,https://ebird.org/species/amedov1,"A medium-sized dove of foothill and montane forest. Brown on the upperparts, head, and chest, with a grayish belly and pale gray corners to the tail. Note the pale streak under the eye and the bare pink facial skin in front of and behind it. Similar to White-eared Brown-Dove, but Amethyst has purplish iridescence on the back of the neck and pale buff under the base of the tail. Voice includes a deep “hoop,” given singly or in series of two or three. Also gives a deep growling sound."
0,Amethyst Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Chalcomitra amethystina,https://ebird.org/species/amesun2,"Large sunbird with a long but thin bill. Males sometimes look all-black but also show green and maroon iridescent patches in good light. Females have pale eyebrows and streaked underparts. Found in forest, moist scrub, woodland, and gardens. Generally uncommon. The song is a mix of “chyup” notes and higher scratchy notes and twitters. Male is distinctive in good light. Female can be confused with female Scarlet-chested Sunbird but shows an eyebrow stripe and has streaks rather than smudges below. Also similar to female Green-throated Sunbird, but less boldly streaked below than that species."
0,Amethyst Woodstar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Calliphlox amethystina,https://ebird.org/species/amewoo1,"Tiny, short-billed hummingbird of forests, forest edges, and savanna woodlands. Both sexes are green on the back with a white band across the rump, but males have glossy pink throat and a deeply forked tail. Females have a white throat, a short tail, and cinnamon flanks and undertail."
0,Ampay Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus whitneyi,https://ebird.org/species/amptap1,"Dark gray tapaculo with a pale eyebrow known only from a few sites in the eastern Andes of southern Peru. While long known to be something different, it was finally described as a new species in 2020. Rump, tail, and lower underparts are brownish and faintly barred, though this is often hard to see in the field. The pale eyebrow is a good feature, but it is very inconspicuous on some birds, and ID is best confirmed by voice. Song is a slow, steady series of inflected chirps that may go on for a minute, and the notes sometimes have a buzzy quality. Inhabits high elevation forest and scrub near and above tree line. Stays low and often hops on the ground."
0,Amur Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco amurensis,https://ebird.org/species/amufal1,"The male of this small falcon is sooty gray with rufous-orange thighs and vent.

Similar to Golden-spangled and White-barred Piculets, but Arrowhead has chevron-shaped spots (not barring) on the breast and belly, and is strictly confined to coastal habitats."
0,Arrowhead Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga pharetra,https://ebird.org/species/arrwar1,"A small active species found high in moist woodlands. Frequently flicks its tail and often gives impression of being entirely heavily streaked. Blackpoll Warbler can be somewhat similar, but fall birds are tinged with some degree of yellow below, and spring males have a bold white cheek. Black-and-white Warbler is also similar, but it has bold black-and-white stripes (as opposed to distinct streaks as on Arrowhead Warbler) on crown and is usually found creeping along tree trunks or limbs. Call is a hard chip with a slightly squeaky quality. Song is relatively quiet and variable consisting of “tsi” notes; often with two or three introductory notes followed by one or two notes at a lower pitch then several notes at original pitch, given in rapid succession."
0,Ascension Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata aquila,https://ebird.org/species/asifri1,"A huge black bird with a very long hooked bill and a long, trailing deeply forked tail. Soars on giant wings, often harassing other birds to steal their food. Male is entirely black with a limited red throat. Female is black with a wide reddish chest band. Almost identical to Magnificent Frigatebird, but slightly smaller, with a more limited red throat patch. Lacks the pale upperwing panel of Great Frigatebird. Female is the only entirely dark female frigatebird; reddish chest band is diagnostic. Mostly pelagic."
0,Ash's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra ashi,https://ebird.org/species/ashlar1,"A chunky gray-brown lark with scaly-looking upperparts, a pink-buff mantle, and a red-brown wing panel. The pale eyebrow and buffy-white underparts are lightly streaked; the outer tail feathers are white. Rare and endangered, localized in coastal grassy plains on sand dunes with fossilized coral outcrops 80 kilometers north of Mogadishu. Vocalizations unknown. Most other larks within its range are browner or rufous on the upperparts."
0,Ashambu Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Montecincla meridionalis,https://ebird.org/species/kerlau3,"This is the only montane laughingthrush in its range and hence unmistakable. From forehead to nape it is pale brown with indistinct gray streaking. Short whitish eyebrow does not extend prominently behind the eye. Upperparts cold gray-brown, wings and tail browner; chin and breast whitish with broad gray streaking, central belly and vent white, flanks and sides of vent rufous-chestnut. Inhabits stunted montane and reed-bamboo forests; seen in pairs or noisy flocks, producing a melodious “pee-koo-pee-koo” song and several other chatters intermingled with musical notes. Heard more often than seen; its songs and calls are usually the first indication of its presence."
0,Ashy Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Hemixos flavala,https://ebird.org/species/ashbul1,"A particularly sharply-dressed bulbul. Throughout most of its range, gray overall with bright yellow-green wing panels, round brown ear patches, and a white throat. Birds in southern Indochina are browner overall, with less contrast. Dark bushy crest is often raised, giving the bird a messy-haired appearance. Inhabits a wide range of wooded habitats in foothill, submontane, and montane regions, often foraging in flocks with other bulbul species. Song consists of short, jumbled phrases of metallic warbled notes. Calls are variable, including both harsh chattering and tuneful piping notes."
0,Ashy Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola cinereolus,https://ebird.org/species/ashcis1,"A large, long-tailed, streak-backed upland cisticola. Note the lack of rufous or rich brown in the plumage, and also the pale tips to the tail. Found in dry thorn savanna and thornscrub. Similar to other cisticolas, especially Rattling, Tana River, and Boran, but identified by its song and by the absence of rufous or brown on the cap. Often sits on top of bushes and trees to sing. Song is a short musical whistled phrase, usually with a downward pitch trend, but sometimes trending upward. Much more musical than the song of Boran Cisticola, often with more variation in pitch. The calls are high-pitched squeaks."
0,Ashy Drongo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicruridae,Dicrurus leucophaeus,https://ebird.org/species/ashdro1,"A slim, medium-sized drongo with bright red eyes and gray plumage that is almost black in the western parts of its range and quite pale in the eastern parts of its range; eastern birds also often have an oval-shaped pale facial patch. It has a long slim tail with a deep fork. Common in wooded habitats where it sallies for insects and aggressively chases other birds that may compete for food or nectar. Most birds migrate south every winter. Similar to Black Drongo, but slimmer and usually in different habitats. Calls include harsh and sweet notes, and can mimic some bird species poorly."
0,Ashy Flowerpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum vulneratum,https://ebird.org/species/ashflo1,"A tiny, plump, short-tailed gray songbird. Male distinctive: uniform gray except for diagnostic prominent red breast patch and red rump. Female lacks chest patch, but still shows diagnostic red rump. Juvenile is gray, lacking any red.

Females lay eggs in the nests of other large birds, including crows, shrikes, and starlings. Song is a loud, persistent “ko-EL!” similar to a peacock’s call."
0,Asian Openbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Anastomus oscitans,https://ebird.org/species/asiope1,"A relatively small stork species with a grayish to white body and black wings and tail with a hint of gloss. The Asian Openbill gets its name from a distinctive gap in the dull grayish yellow bill. Note the pinkish legs. Asian Openbills inhabit wetland habitats including shallow marshes, flooded agricultural fields, and lakes. From a distance they could be confused with herons, but they can be clearly distinguished from herons by their feeding habits—wading slowly through shallow water. Soars frequently, often in large dense flocks; note extended neck, unlike retracted neck of herons and egrets."
0,Asian Palm-Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Cypsiurus balasiensis,https://ebird.org/species/aspswi1,"A small gray-brown swift with long thin wings and a long heavily-forked tail.

The song is variable, but most often is a burbling series of sweet notes given in three parts, with the middle part higher pitched. The call is a single loud sweet chip."
0,Barking Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox connivens,https://ebird.org/species/barowl1,Medium sized gray-brown owl with white underparts heavily streaked brown. Favors edge habitats and often roosts near creeks in woodlands. Feeds on small to medium sized mammals. Known for its diagnostic ‘woof-woof’ call which sounds like a dog barking.
0,Barlow's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Calendulauda barlowi,https://ebird.org/species/barlar1,"A medium-sized lark that has a rounded head lacking a crest, a slightly decurved bill, a bold face pattern, and a heavily streaked breast with unstreaked flanks. Upperparts coloration is mostly sandy-brown to tan, often matching prevailing soil color in the region. Pairs are resident in soft sands of semi-arid Karoo and coastal shrublands, preferring to dig in sandy areas for insects. The male sings from bushes, and in spring has a protracted aerial display 10 to 30 meters up in the air, with deep wingbeats, fluttering, and dangling legs. The song is a distinctive set of introductory clicks followed by a short, downslurred scratchy musical phrase that may or may not end in a semi-musical trill. The slightly smaller and more boldly marked Karoo Lark has streaking extending to the flanks that is lacking on Barlow’s Lark."
0,Barn Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Hirundo rustica,https://ebird.org/species/barswa,"A fairly large, colorful swallow. Usually easy to identify with its long, forked tail and dark rump. Iridescent navy-blue above with a rich orange throat and forehead. Underparts vary across range, from bright buffy-orange to whitish. Occurs in any open habitat, especially large fields and wetlands. Often seen foraging in flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of swallow. Typically nests close to human habitation; builds a muddy cup nest in a barn or under a dock. Listen for dry, scratchy “svit svit” calls. Note head and breast pattern and tail length to help separate from various similar species in Asia and Australia (e.g., Welcome Swallow, Hill Swallow, Pacific Swallow)."
0,Barnacle Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Branta leucopsis,https://ebird.org/species/bargoo,"Handsome and distinctive. A rather compact and fairly small goose with big white face patch, silvery upperparts, and black neck and breast sharply demarcated from white belly. Breeds mainly in Greenland, Iceland, and Spitsbergen, and locally around the Baltic Sea. Winters in farmland and grassy wetlands mainly in coastal lowlands throughout northern Europe. Free flying feral birds resident locally at lakes and parks in the U.K. In main wintering areas, occurs in hundreds or even thousands; elsewhere, singles and family groups can be found among flocks of other geese. Rare but increasing visitor to northeastern North America, almost always with flocks of Canada Geese."
0,Barolo Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus baroli,https://ebird.org/species/litshe1,"Scarce and poorly known seabird breeding locally on islands of Azores, Madeira, and Canaries; very rarely seen at sea, usually as single birds, often not with other seabirds. Small, stiff-winged seabird that flies fast and low over the water (almost like an auk), gliding mainly in windy conditions. Note white-faced appearance, extensively white underparts contrasting with blackish upperparts. Trailing edge of upperwings often has a frosty sheen. Appreciably smaller and quicker on the wing than much commoner Manx Shearwater."
0,Barratt's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus barratti,https://ebird.org/species/afswar1,"A skulky, dull brown warbler with a long and graduated tail, a pale grayish eyebrow, and a throat that is lightly streaked. It creeps around mouse-like in thick undergrowth and tangles in forest and forest edge. It is also found in isolated pockets of scrub, often adjacent to streams, and is frequently detected and identified by its song, mostly delivered between September and December: 2-3 sweet “tsiit” notes followed by a loud trill of 15-20 harsh “tchui” notes. It also has a strident chipping alarm call “tddd-ddr-ddr-ddr-ddr-tt.” The similar Knysna Warbler differs from Barratt’s Warbler by its shorter tail, darker underparts, less pronounced throat streaking, and different song."
0,Barred Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus doliatus,https://ebird.org/species/barant1,"A retiring bird of thickets, forest edge, and other tangled vegetation. Distinctive song is heard regularly and pairs are usually within earshot of each other, but antshrikes generally remain hidden. The sexes look very different, but both have a spiky crest that is often raised. Male is barred black-and-white in ‘convict stripes,’ whereas female looks a lot like a wren with a stout bill that has a slightly hooked tip."
0,Barred Antthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Formicariidae,Chamaeza mollissima,https://ebird.org/species/barant2,"Compact brown bird with a stubby black bill. Warm reddish brown with heavy black-and-white barring on the undersides, face, and eyebrow. Walks around the ground in dense montane forest with a springy gait, bobbing its tail up and down with each slow step. Exceptionally timid bird heard far more often than seen; listen for its long hooting song, an accelerating series of low toots."
0,Barred Becard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Pachyramphus versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/barbec1,"Becards are reminiscent of flycatchers but in a different family; they are medium sized and have a rather flat head. Barred is small for a becard; males have a distinctive yellow face, black cap and back, and thin barring on the underparts. Females have a gray cap, rufous wings, and more even yellow underparts. Singles or pairs are found in forested areas, including edges and second growth. Not usually super high in the trees."
0,Barred Buttonquail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Turnicidae,Turnix suscitator,https://ebird.org/species/barbut1,"Tiny rotund, short-tailed bird, scarcely larger than a sparrow; like a diminutive partridge or quail but only distantly related. Brown with scaly streaking above, extensive black barring on the chest (more extensive on the female), and rich tawny flanks. Extremely difficult to detect, moving about invisibly in dense weedy vegetation in fields, forest edges, and farmland. Flying birds have whirring flight, show contrast between dark flight feathers and paler coverts. Courting females give sonorous, booming calls from dense vegetation."
0,Barred Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina lineata,https://ebird.org/species/yeecus1,"Medium-sized slender bird with a short, pointed bill and bold yellow eye. Slaty gray except for white lower belly and undertail with fine gray barring. Usually seen high up in fruiting trees (often fig trees). Inhabits rainforest in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and tropical and subtropical east coast of Australia."
0,Barred Cuckoo-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Macropygia unchall,https://ebird.org/species/bacdov1,"Shy brown dove of forests with dense understory. Wings and tail are dark brown, and the rest of the body is closer to tan. Males are boldly barred on the chest, and both sexes have a bronzy-green tinge to the nape. Seldom seen out in the open, this species is quick to flee when approached, flying strongly and quickly through dense vegetation. Appears longer-tailed than Spotted Dove and Turtle Dove, both when in flight and on the ground."
0,Barred Forest-Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Micrastur ruficollis,https://ebird.org/species/baffal1,"Retiring and rarely seen raptor of humid forest in lowlands and foothills. Usually detected by sharp, barking call given mainly early and late in the day. Does not soar. Most likely encountered sitting quietly at middle to low levels inside the forest. Adult has orange-yellow facial skin and pale eyes. Immature is creamy below, often with some dark barring. Note the long yellow legs."
0,Barred Fruiteater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Pipreola arcuata,https://ebird.org/species/barfru1,"Chunky, short-tailed, flat-headed bird patterned in green and black. Male has black head and breast, pale yellow belly with bold dark barring, and mossy green upperparts with bold pale spotting on the wing. Female is similar but has a green head with barring all the way up the throat. On both sexes, note red bill and legs and pale eye varying from orange to gray to whitish. Fairly common in stunted forested habitats in the upper subtropical and temperate zone in the Andes. Sluggish; perches quietly in the middle levels of the forest, sometimes following a mixed-species flock. May be seen singly or in pairs, but several can gather around a fruiting tree. Listen for super high-pitched calls."
0,Barred Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Morphnarchus princeps,https://ebird.org/species/barhaw1,"This montane raptor has very broad wings and a disproportionately short tail. The black hood is a good mark that stands out at a distance, but the namesake bars on the belly are thin and indistinct. Sexes similar. More often seen flying over forest rather than perched. Often quite vocal; listen for the far-carrying descending whistles, usually repeated."
0,Barred Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Ianthocincla lunulata,https://ebird.org/species/barlau1,"Pale brown laughingthrush with a pale face, black barring on the back, and a blue-gray wing panel. Handsome but shy and inconspicuous, foraging quietly on the ground and in shrubbery and thickets. Very similar in appearance to the rarer, more range-restricted, and dark-throated White-necklaced Laughingthrush. Note Barred’s pale, relatively unmarked throat."
0,Barred Owlet-nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Aegothelidae,Aegotheles bennettii,https://ebird.org/species/barown1,"A common, medium-sized owlet-nightjar of lowland and foothill forests. Dark gray with fine barring over the whole body. A black central crown stripe, black eyebrows reaching the back of the neck and a pale collar. The similar Australian Owlet-Nightjar co-occurs, but Barred Owlet-Nightjar is darker and lacks the pale cheek. Voice, a short, raspy, falling “kiyo!” or low “wak!” repeated several times."
0,Barred Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Bolborhynchus lineola,https://ebird.org/species/barpar1,"Small, fast-flying parakeet of humid evergreen forest in foothills and highlands, especially in areas with seeding bamboo. Usually seen in pairs or small groups flying high overhead; rarely seen perched. Note pointed tail, fast and slightly bounding flight, and habitat (no other small parakeets occur in highlands of Mexico and northern Central America). Blackish barring on upperparts only apparent with a good view."
0,Barred Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Nystalus radiatus,https://ebird.org/species/barpuf1,"An unobtrusive bird with an oversized head and bill. Look for tiger-striped pattern—warm cinnamon-brown overall with uneven black barring. Also note slightly darker cap and staring pale eye. Uncommon; found around forest edge and secondary woodland in the lowlands from Panama to western Ecuador. Perches still for long periods of time, often on an exposed perch. Frequently detected by distinctive wolf-whistling calls."
0,Barred Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus torquatus,https://ebird.org/species/barrai1,"A strikingly marked rail with a short cocked tail. Olive-brown above and heavily barred black-and-white below and on throat, with a rufous band across the chest. Face is strikingly black with a thick white stripe. Favors damp marshy grassland up to 1000 meters of elevation. Similar to Buff-banded Rail, but easily identified by its white facial stripe and lack of a white eyebrow. Often heard giving a loud, harsh croaking chorus."
0,Barred Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Crypturellus casiquiare,https://ebird.org/species/bartin1,"Very rare and poorly known tinamou of remote lowland rainforest. Existing records suggest that it favors areas with sandy soil. Rather small for a tinamou, with a chestnut head, a black back, wings marked with rusty bars, dingy underparts, and a pale throat. Few birders have ever seen it, and even hearing one requires some luck. Song is a series of whistles that starts out by accelerating and rising slightly in pitch, then slows down and falls towards the end."
0,Barred Wren-Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Calamonastes fasciolatus,https://ebird.org/species/bawwar1,"Long-tailed brownish warbler. In all plumages, shows heavy barring below, but this barring is obscured by a brown band across the breast of breeding males. Generally uncommon in arid, thorny savanna. Often raises its tail in wren-like fashion. Normal song is a vibrating, metallic note that is frequently repeated. Another vocalization is a repeated two-part “gid-yup.” Similar to Miombo Wren-Warbler, but has little overlap in range and separated by dusky underparts and darker eye."
0,Barrow's Goldeneye,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Bucephala islandica,https://ebird.org/species/bargol,"Striking diving duck of coastal harbors, mountain lakes, and large rivers. Very similar to Common Goldeneye. Males are easiest: Barrow’s has more black on the back, a downward-pointing spur on the side, and a crescent-shaped (not circular) white patch on the face. Females can be very difficult. Barrow’s usually has a yellow bill, but Common can rarely show a dull yellowish bill. Head and bill shape are important: Barrow’s has a steeper forehead and a puffy nape, and a shorter bill with a more rounded lower edge. Fairly common in western U.S. and Canada; much less common in the northeast. Small population in Iceland. Frequently found in mixed flocks with Common Goldeneye."
0,Bartlett's Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Crypturellus bartletti,https://ebird.org/species/bartin2,"Small tinamou of floodplain rainforest. Reddish brown with limited black barring on the wings. Found in tall lowland rainforest, especially around water and in seasonally flooded areas, and can be quite common. Listen for a series of whistles given at a pace of about one note per four seconds that gradually accelerates until about twice as fast; recalls the song of Cinereous Tinamou, but faster and usually accelerating."
0,Basra Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus griseldis,https://ebird.org/species/barwar2,"Medium-sized Acrocephalus warbler with cold gray-olive-brown plumage and whitish underparts. Note the long and slender bill and the short eyebrow that reaches just behind eye. Distinctly larger that Eurasian Reed Warbler and smaller than Great Reed Warbler. Breed in extensive reedbeds. Call a harsh ""charr."" Song is rather quiet and slow mixed with deep, bulbul-like notes."
0,Bassian Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera lunulata,https://ebird.org/species/oltthr1,"Large thrush, greenish brown with black scallop marks above, pale with black scaly marks below. Smaller Russet-tailed Thrush has larger-appearing bill, is less strongly marked above. Bassian lacks white in tail corners, usually visible in flying or preening Russet-tailed. The smaller wingbar has less prominent pale tips in adult Bassian. Introduced Song Thrush has spots rather than scaly marks below. Inhabits wet forests, where it forages in leaf litter. Song recalls that of Common Blackbird, very different from Russet-tailed song."
0,Bat Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco rufigularis,https://ebird.org/species/batfal1,"Dashing small falcon of tropical lowlands and foothills. Prefers forest edge, adjacent semi-open areas with tall trees, buildings. Found at several Maya ruins in Mexico and northern Central America, also locally in towns. Looks dark overall with a contrasting white throat, and in flight can be confused with White-collared Swift. With a good view, note the rusty belly and ‘trousers.’ Hunts bats at dusk, but main food is small birds caught in flight."
0,Bat Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Macheiramphus alcinus,https://ebird.org/species/bathaw1,"An acrobatic, swift-like raptor with angular wings and a massive gape; capable of snatching prey from the air and devouring it in a flash while still on the wing. Dark with varying amounts of white on the underside; African birds have patchy white throughout the underparts, while white is restricted to the throat and lower belly on New Guinean birds and solely to the throat in Southeast Asian birds. Inactive during the day; hunts at dawn and dusk, and occasionally into the night if light is sufficient. Generally uncommon and localized, most reliably encountered near large bat roosts in forested areas, but can also be seen over open forest, fields, and fringes of habitation."
0,Bateleur,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Terathopius ecaudatus,https://ebird.org/species/batele1,"A very distinctive, short-tailed eagle. Young birds are uniformly dark brown, and adults are mostly black with a bright red face and legs. Sexes differ, especially in flight, and can be told by the width of the black band on the back edge of the white underwing: narrow in females, broad in males. It flies low when foraging, with wings lifted above the body and rocking from left to right in an unstable-looking fashion. Bateleurs hunt small animals and eat carrion, and they are often first the first raptors to arrive at a carcass."
0,Bates's Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgus batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batnig2,"Large, dark, long-tailed forest nightjar. Males have small white patches in the outer wings and at the corners of the tail; females have all-dark wings and can show small buff tail corners. Found in lowland rainforest, including forest edge and clearings. The distinctive vocalization is usually given from a tree: a single barking “kow,” followed after a pause by a quick series of several similar notes. Found in the same habitat as Brown Nightjar, but larger and longer-tailed; males further distinguished by the pale patches in the wing and tail."
0,Bates's Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batpaf1,"Both sexes show a dark gray head and underparts with a rufous back, tail, and undertail. Tail is usually short, but males in the southwest part of the range can sport very long central tail feathers. Both sexes have a blue bill and ring around the eye. Found in lowland rainforest and swamp forest. A restless, active bird of middle levels of the forest. Similar to Rufous-vented Paradise-Flycatcher, but has a paler gray head without a crest, and usually has a shorter tail. Can be similar to African Paradise-Flycatcher, but distinguished by the rufous undertail and lack of a crest. Call is a series of tearing “shreet” notes, and song is a fast, bubbling series of “twee” notes."
0,Bates's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batsun2,"A very small nondescript sunbird with a short orange-based bill that curves uniformly along its length; easily mistaken for females of other sunbirds. The only features on the olive upperparts are indistinct paler eyebrows and lines running under the eyes, and yellow edging to the wings. Although often hidden, the male has yellow or whitish (not red) tufts at the shoulders. Singles are local and inconspicuous at the edges of lowland and riverine forest, sometimes entering secondary growth; it joins mixed-flocks and is frequently attracted to epiphytes in mossy clumps. Calls a high-pitched “tseeep” and trills. Little Green and Fraser’s sunbirds are similar to Bates’s but brighter, with straighter bills and more distinct yellowish eye-rings; Ursula’s Sunbird has a long decurved bill and grayish face and underparts."
0,Bates's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batswi1,"A small, entirely blackish swift with a slightly dusky throat and a deeply forked tail. Flies rapidly over lowland forest, occasionally gliding briefly. Most often found over lowland forests, where it nests in abandoned swallow nests such as those of Forest Swallow. In profile, similar to African Palm-Swift or Scarce Swift, but Bates’s Swift has wider wings and a bigger body, and is overall much darker."
0,Bates's Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batwea1,"A weaver with a plain olive back and yellow underparts and different-looking sexes: the male has a chestnut head and face and a small black throat patch, while the female has a black hood reaching below the eyes and a yellow throat. Juvenile is like the female, but the hood is duller. Rare and restricted to southern Cameroon, where it remains poorly known from lowland rainforest. Vocalizations are undescribed."
0,Baudin's Black-Cockatoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Cacatuidae,Calyptorhynchus baudinii,https://ebird.org/species/whtblc1,"Black cockatoo with white ear patch and white tail panel. Inhabits moist eucalypt forest in the southwestern corner of Western Australia, where it eats seeds from large seed pods of Marri and Karri trees. Unlikely to be observed out on the coastal sand plains of Perth. Very similar to Carnaby’s Black-Cockatoo but with much longer, pointed upper mandible. Calls include mournful wailing cries that are more clipped than those of Carnaby’s."
0,Baudo Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope ortoni,https://ebird.org/species/baugua1,"Medium-sized turkeylike bird restricted to very wet rainforest in lowlands and foothills of western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. It is dark brown with white streaks on the underparts and a red dewlap. Similar to the more common Crested Guan, but is smaller, browner (lacking chestnut on the belly and tail), and shows little or no crest. Baudo Guan is usually found in small groups high in the trees, and is very sensitive to habitat alteration; it is rarely encountered away from remote, relatively undisturbed areas."
0,Bay Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria capitalis,https://ebird.org/species/bayant1,"Dark antpitta found in cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes in central Peru. Much of its range is remote and rarely visited by birders. Adult is similar to both Chestnut Antpitta and Rufous Antpitta, but note the larger size, gray crown, thin eye-ring, unbarred belly patch, and voice. The rarely-seen juvenile is even darker with buff and gray barring and a spotted crown. Inhabits forest understory, especially where there is abundant bamboo. Stays on the ground when not singing and usually very tough to see. Song is a quick series that consists of a short note followed by two to five slightly lower notes."
0,Bay Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus celebensis,https://ebird.org/species/baycou1,"A reddish-brown cuckoo with a long, often shaggy-looking tail. Juvenile shows a pale eye and a paler breast and throat than adults. The species favors vine tangles within forest and forest edge in lowlands and foothills, where it is usually encountered singly or in pairs. The entirely brown body, lacking black, separates this species from Lesser Coucal. Song is a series of “hoot” notes that often encourages other nearby coucals to respond. Alarm call is a harsh, short rasping “burr.”"
0,Bay Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Blythipicus pyrrhotis,https://ebird.org/species/baywoo1,"A medium-sized woodpecker of dense forests, often encountered only through its song, which sounds like maniacal descending laughter; also gives a loud, high-pitched grating chatter. Bright rufous overall, with black banding on the wings and tail, a paler brown head, and a long, bright yellow bill. Only the male has a red patch on the back of the head. May appear dark brown from a distance or when shaded, but often flashes bright orange when in flight. Drums infrequently, if at all."
0,Bay Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cantorchilus nigricapillus,https://ebird.org/species/baywre1,"Medium-sized wren; strikingly patterned if seen well. Rufous above with complex black-and-white face markings; clean white throat. Some populations have clean rufous flanks, others barred black-and-white. Black cap and nape give it a hooded appearance. Often stays hidden in tangles and thickets at forest edge or second growth, often near water. Difficult to get a clear look at. Listen for loud, ringing song, often given as a duet."
0,Baya Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus philippinus,https://ebird.org/species/baywea1,"A widespread weaver that is known for its nest—a long hanging nest with a bulbous chamber and a narrow tubular entrance. Breeding males have yellow forehead and crown, a dark throat that contrasts with yellow underparts. Nonbreeding males and females are similar except they have buffy colors where breeding males are yellow; also note the dark streaks on the back and the broad buffy eyebrow on females. Juvenile resembles female, but lack the female’s obvious eyebrow. Baya Weavers lack the strongly streaked appearance of Streaked Weavers. Regional variation in plumage exist mainly in the amount of yellow and black in breeding plumage. Occur as flocks, particularly in breeding season. Advertising calls of males are an easy way to detect the species as several males in the flock call together creating a cacophony of a series of rasping chatters followed by a buzzing whistle interspersed with long chatters."
0,Beach Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Todiramphus saurophagus,https://ebird.org/species/beakin2,"A large coastal kingfisher with a gleaming white head, a thin black line behind the eye, and a blue-green back. Juvenile duller, with buff on crown and underside. Found singly or in pairs in mangroves, on beaches, and along rocky shorelines, where it often perches on exposed rocks or in trees bordering coast. Clean white crown and narrow (not wide) black strip behind eye distinguish it from all forms of the smaller Collared Kingfisher. Vocal, giving harsh calls: a “choo-chew” descending on the second note and a rapid, agitated “kip-kip-kip-kip-kip.”"
0,Bearded Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Lybiidae,Lybius dubius,https://ebird.org/species/beabar1,"Large, colorful barbet with a huge ivory-colored bill. Note the red underparts with a thick black bar across the middle. Found in a variety of habitats, including moist and dry savanna, woodland, gardens, and secondary growth, often in the vicinity of figs and other fruiting trees. Most often in pairs or small groups. The call is a very rough, explosive “rwauk,” often given in a slow series. Similar to Double-toothed Barbet, but separated by the black chest band and the lack of a red bar on the shoulder."
0,Bearded Bellbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Procnias averano,https://ebird.org/species/beabel1,"Famously loud and distinctive-looking, this large cotinga is one of the iconic species of northern South America. Male is unmistakable with mostly white body, black wings, brown head, and throat full of dangling black wattles that look like the bird threw up a plateful of worms onto itself. Female is much plainer, greenish with faint yellow streaks on the underparts. Female is extremely similar to female White Bellbird; where range overlaps with White Bellbird, Bearded typically occurs at higher elevations. Most often found by the extremely loud and far-carrying “bonk!” call given by the male."
0,Bearded Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope barbata,https://ebird.org/species/beagua1,"Large chickenlike bird with a long tail. Chocolate-brown overall with pinkish-red legs and silvery frosting on head and neck. Restricted to southern Ecuador and northwestern Peru, where it occurs in subtropical and temperate forest from around 2,000 to 3,000 m. Typically in pairs or small groups in the mid levels of forest. Replaces Andean Guan south of Cuenca and west of Jaén; also note subtle differences in patterning: Bearded has more extensive silver on brow and a streaked, not scaled, breast."
0,Bearded Mountaineer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Oreonympha nobilis,https://ebird.org/species/beamou1,"Fairly large hummingbird with a striking facial pattern and a long tail. Brown above, white below, with a brown head and black-and-white forked tail. Males have an iridescent green and purple gorget, and in some populations a blue forehead; females are similar but duller. Found in dry mountain scrub at high elevations."
0,Bearded Reedling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Panuridae,Panurus biarmicus,https://ebird.org/species/bearee1,"Fairly common but local in extensive reed beds. Not easy to see well but sometimes feeds at edges, often very low or on adjacent muddy ground. Flight typically low over reeds with whirring wingbeats. Often in small groups. No other species looks very similar, particularly given habitat and behavior: note bright cinnamon-brown plumage, long tail, and yellowish bill; male has blue-gray head and broad black mustaches."
0,Bearded Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops barbarus,https://ebird.org/species/besowl,"Small, yellow-eyed owl of humid pine-oak forest in the highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala. Plumage much like other screech-owls, but ear tufts are very short and often not noticeable. It has relatively distinct whitish eyebrows and the dark marks on the underparts are somewhat scalloped rather than streaked. Song is a purring trill, which could be passed off as coming from a frog or insect. Favors denser and more humid areas than Whiskered Screech-Owl."
0,Bearded Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cercotrichas quadrivirgata,https://ebird.org/species/besrob1,"Pretty robin with a brown back, boldly marked face, and unstreaked rufous chest. Found in broadleaved woodland, moist savanna, and thickets. Shy bird that generally skulks in thick undergrowth. Song is a variable, musical series of whistles. Certain two-noted phrases can be repeated many times. Similar to Red-backed Scrub-Robin, but lacks white wings bars, and shows a rufous breast without streaks."
0,Bearded Tachuri,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Polystictus pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/beatac1,A small attractive flycatcher. Males have a striking face pattern with a black crown hiding concealed white feathers and a black face that contrasts with its brown back. Note the rusty rump and cinnamon wash below.

0,Blue Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Cyanograucalus azureus,https://ebird.org/species/blucus1,"A beautiful, entirely blue thrush-like bird that can be surprisingly hard to make out in the dark subcanopy of tropical forests as it forages high above the ground. When seen well, it is unmistakable, with its entirely blue body, red eyes, dark face, and black bill. When it is backlit in the trees, look for its distinctive profile perched close to branches with relatively short legs and tail, and its generally unicolored appearance. Occurs in small flocks whose calls consist of hoarse, whiny “tchuwee” and terse “tchup” notes. Song is a piercing “puuuEEEEoooo” or “wheeEEEr” that can be fairly variable in pitch and length."
0,Blue Dacnis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Dacnis cayana,https://ebird.org/species/bludac1,"Small active warblerlike tanager with sharply pointed bill.
