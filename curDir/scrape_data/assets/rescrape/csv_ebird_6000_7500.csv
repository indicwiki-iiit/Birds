0,Naretha Bluebonnet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Northiella narethae,https://ebird.org/species/bluebo4,"Brown parrot with yellow belly, red undertail, and blue face, found in dry woodland habitats of the extreme southeastern part of Western Australia, on the western fringe of the Nullarbor Plain. In flight, the blue wings and red shoulders contrast with pale brown back; lacks the bright green back of other desert parrots. Identify from the very similar Greater Bluebonnet by a completely yellow belly and also by range."
0,Nariño Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus vicinior,https://ebird.org/species/nartap2,"A standard Scytalopus tapaculo: plain dark gray with browner flanks and rump. Acts like a mouse, scurrying around on or near the ground within montane forest. Very difficult to see. Restricted range on the west slope of the Andes in Colombia and Ecuador. Occurs from around 1,250–2,000 m, which is higher than Choco Tapaculo but lower than Spillmann’s Tapaculo (but some overlap). Far more often heard than seen. Listen for fairly rapid trill with distinct notes; notably slower than Spillmann’s."
0,Nashville Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Leiothlypis ruficapilla,https://ebird.org/species/naswar,"Small warbler with sharply pointed bill. Look for gray head, white eyering, yellow underparts (including throat), and olive upperparts. Sometimes pumps tail. Two disjunct breeding populations are very similar in appearance. Breeds in coniferous or mixed forests, often near clearings, second-growth, or bogs. In migration and winter, tends to be found in patchy woodland or brushy areas, including field edges and thickets. Winters primarily in Mexico. Listen for its loud chipping song, broken into two parts. Compare dull immature Nashville with Virginia’s Warbler; Nashvilles always have greenish wings. Also sometimes mistaken for larger gray-headed warblers like Mourning or Connecticut, but Nashville is much smaller, shorter-tailed, and sharper-billed."
0,Natewa Silktail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Lamprolia klinesmithi,https://ebird.org/species/silkta3,"Small and stub-tailed, appearing mostly dark.

A forest-dwelling parrot that is more common on offshore islands, but flourishes in areas where mammalian predators are controlled; some visit city and rural gardens. Harsh, grating “kra-aa” call is often heard before the bird is seen. The species also whistles a series of tuneful notes while perched. Distinguishable from Kea by smaller size, olive-brown as opposed to olive-green plumage, and range."
0,New Zealand King Shag,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Leucocarbo carunculatus,https://ebird.org/species/rofsha1,"A large, thick-necked black-and-white marine shag endemic to the Marlborough Sounds of New Zealand.

In the U.S. restricted to riparian woodland with dense understory and mesquite in the Southwest. Plain gray overall with inconspicuous pale wingbars and pale yellowish belly. Peaked bushy crown. Similar to Empidonax flycatchers but note bushy crest, blunter bill, and less obvious wingbars. Generally quite active. Often detected by song: a series of descending plaintive whistles ""dee dee dee dee."""
0,Northern Bentbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Oncostoma cinereigulare,https://ebird.org/species/norben1,"Tiny flycatcher of humid forest and woodland in tropical lowlands. Inconspicuous, mainly foraging at low to mid-levels in forest interior and edge, where flits from perch to perch and then sits still. Heard far more often than seen: common call a low, frog-like churr. Overall plumage color and pattern much like many flycatchers, but note its tiny size, ‘broken-nose’ bill profile, pale eyes, and relatively long, thin, pale pinkish legs."
0,Northern Black-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis edolioides,https://ebird.org/species/nobfly1,"A slim, long-tailed all-black flycatcher with a dark eye. Found in savanna, woodland, and cultivated areas. Single birds or pairs sit out on conspicuous perches, sometimes quite low. Very similar to Southern Black-Flycatcher, but there is virtually no overlap in range, and Northern lacks gloss in the black plumage. Distinguished from drongos by the slimmer bill and dark brown eye. Could be confused with certain black cuckooshrikes or boubous, but has a more vertical posture, and sits motionless for much longer periods. Not very vocal, but does have a pretty song of various trills, wheezes, and whistles given with long pauses between phrases."
0,Northern Bobwhite,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Colinus virginianus,https://ebird.org/species/norbob,"Small and rotund with intricate brown, black, and white patterning. Some striking variation in plumage across range. Most males, including those in the eastern U.S., have bold black and white head pattern and heavy white spotting on belly. In Mexico, males can be entirely cinnamon-colored below and have a fully black head; some might have a white eyebrow or a dark chest band. Females are more consistent throughout range: look for buffy throat and eyebrow. Pairs or small groups are found in scrubby fields and brushy woods.

0,Oahu Amakihi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Chlorodrepanis flava,https://ebird.org/species/oahama,"A small Hawaiian honeycreeper of forests on Oahu. Males are bright yellow and females are grayer with two whitish wingbars. The bill is thicker and more curved than that of Japanese White-eye. Occurs in native and non-native forests, parks, and some suburban areas near mountains. Moves quickly among leaves and small branches in the understory and forest canopy in search of nectar, insects, and fruit. Song is a trill that does not change in pitch or speed. Call is a nasal “chee.”"
0,Oahu Elepaio,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Chasiempis ibidis,https://ebird.org/species/elepai4,"A small flycatcher of forested habitats on Oahu. Adults are brown above, whitish below, and have white wingbars, rump, and tail tips. Immatures are reddish brown and have buffy wingbars. Uncommon and local on Oahu, more numerous in valleys. Bold and curious; not afraid of people and may follow hikers. Often holds tail cocked up at an angle. Male song is a shrill “El-eh-pie-oh” for which the species is named. Both sexes give a variety of soft calls and scolding notes. Responds to pishing and squeaking."

0,Oak Titmouse,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Baeolophus inornatus,https://ebird.org/species/oaktit,"Completely nondescript: all gray-brown without any sort of color pattern. Still cute and personable, often in small family groups bustling through their namesake oak trees (though they occasionally stray into other species of trees). Visits feeders. Extremely similar to Juniper Titmouse, but separated by range."
0,Oasis Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Rhodopis vesper,https://ebird.org/species/oashum1,"Small hummingbird of desert lowlands and foothills. Found in gardens, agricultural areas with flowers, and native scrub; often fairly common. Best identified by combination of rather long arched bill and pale rusty rump patch; appreciably larger than most other superficially similar hummingbirds in its range, such as Peruvian Sheartail. Male has a magenta-rose gorget (often messy and incomplete). Female is drab whitish below with duskier sides."
0,Oaxaca Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Aimophila notosticta,https://ebird.org/species/oaxspa1,"Very local and endemic to interior of Oaxaca, where replaces larger and bulkier Rusty Sparrow (no known range overlap). Favors brushy woodland and edge and oak thickets with adjacent grassy areas. Usually rather skulking, on or near the ground, but often feeds at edges early and late in the day. Sings from more conspicuous perches in bushes and trees. Note the all-black bill and strong face pattern, with black lores setting off the broken white eyering."
0,Obbia Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Spizocorys obbiensis,https://ebird.org/species/obblar1,"A small, compact lark with a stout bill that appears swollen and a bold facial pattern, with pale eyebrows and eye-rings and dark moustachial stripes. Upperparts are dark and underparts are pale but heavily streaked, including on the flanks. Endemic to a narrow coastal strip south of Mogadishu, where it prefers sand dunes and coastal scrub with halophytic shrubs. Its short legs give it a hunched posture, unlike other larks within its range. Flight call is “tip-tip”; other vocalizations are unrecorded."

Song, a series of usually 5 “chip” notes, first rising, then falling."
0,Ocellated Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Phaenostictus mcleannani,https://ebird.org/species/oceant1,"Spectacular, chunky forest-dweller; generally uncommon. Electric blue facial skin, rufous body, black throat, and pale scalloped pattern renders this antbird unlikely to be confused with any other species. Larger than other antbirds in range. Can be difficult to see well; found close to the ground in mature forest, usually in pairs or small flocks following an army ant swarm. Listen for descending, scolding call. Sexes alike."
0,Ocellated Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Micropygia schomburgkii,https://ebird.org/species/ocecra1,"A tiny rail found in dense grasslands, often far from water. Extremely difficult to see, but striking plumage renders this species unmistakable: look for warm orange crown and breast, bold white spotting on upperparts, and pink legs. Far more often heard than seen. Listen for a long descending trill with a slightly musical quality, and a harsh growling call. Patchy distribution from Costa Rica to southern Brazil."
0,Ocellated Piculet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picumnus dorbignyanus,https://ebird.org/species/ocepic2,"Gray, spotted piculet of mid-elevation forests. Dusky gray above and white below, with extensive black spotting from the head to the belly; males have a scarlet red forehead patch. Found at higher elevations than most other piculets in its range; grayer, with much more extensive black spotting, than the pale Fine-barred Piculet. Forages singly or in pairs in the mid-story of humid montane forest, sometimes joining mixed-species flocks. Its song is a very high, descending series of sharp, metallic notes."
0,Ocellated Poorwill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Nyctiphrynus ocellatus,https://ebird.org/species/ocepoo1,"Dark brown nightjar of humid forests. Smooth reddish brown overall with small black spots, a clean white throat band, and white tail corners. In flight, appears dark brown overall with white tail corners but no white wing patches. Look for it in mature rainforest, with or without dense understory. Song is a single quavering, reverberating note, “PEEur,” like plucking a taut string."
0,Ocellated Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Cyrtonyx ocellatus,https://ebird.org/species/ocequa1,"Small, elusive quail of brushy pine-oak woods in drier highlands; favors areas with oak scrub and bunchgrass. Usually in small groups; rarely flushes until almost stepped on. It can be seen beside quiet roads and trails, mainly early and late in day, but it usually remains well hidden in cover. Male has striking harlequin face pattern and rusty underparts with complex patterning. Female has a bushy crest and a trace of the male’s facial pattern. Similar species: female Crested Bobwhite."
0,Ocellated Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Acropternis orthonyx,https://ebird.org/species/ocetap1,"The antithesis of a typical tapaculo, Ocellated is large and spectacular. The body is mostly black and covered with bright white spots. The face and rump are bright rufous. Look for the daggerlike hindclaws, which are used to scrape the ground in search of insects. Sexes alike. This chunky bird is quite shy, staying on or near the ground among thick understory and bamboo thickets in montane forest from 2,300–3,500 m. Not usually seen without considerable effort. Listen for its loud descending whistle, “wheeeu.”"
0,Ocellated Thrasher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Toxostoma ocellatum,https://ebird.org/species/ocethr1,"Handsome and uncommon thrasher of oak scrub, thickets, and brushy woodland; endemic to interior highlands of central Mexico. Tosses leaves noisily on the ground, but is usually skulking and rarely seen unless singing. Sings year-round and at any time of day (but mainly early and late), often from a prominent perch. Note the long arched bill, pale eyebrow, brownish eyes, and bold black breast spots (like eyespots, hence the name ocellated). Curve-billed Thrasher occurs in the same areas and is more common, but has golden eyes and weak blurry spotting on breast; beware, song can be similar."
0,Ocellated Turkey,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Meleagris ocellata,https://ebird.org/species/ocetur1,"Large, distinctive, spectacular gamebird of tropical forest, brushy fields, and adjacent clearings. Rarely seen away from protected areas, where can be common and tame. Note orange head ‘warts,’ copper-colored wing panel, and iridescent blue-and-gold eyespots (‘ocelli’) on rump and tail tip. Often in groups; feeds on the ground, but roosts in trees. Beware: domestic turkeys are common in the range of Ocellated, but are usually around people."

Typical song is a series of about five loud, rising whistles followed by “purr-whip!”"
0,Ochraceous Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Alophoixus ochraceus,https://ebird.org/species/ochbul2,"A brownish-olive bulbul with a wispy crest and a puffy, glowingly white throat. Inhabits lowland and foothill forests, where it prefers primary or well-aged secondary growth. Forages in the middle and lower levels of forest, usually in small, noisy flocks. Calls consist primarily of loud, dry “chek” notes; variable song is pleasant and warbling. Extremely similar in appearance to closely related Puff-throated Bulbul, but smaller Ochraceous has darker and browner upperparts, duller yellow underparts, and a shorter crest."
0,Ochraceous Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus ochraceus,https://ebird.org/species/ochpew1,"This rare flycatcher is restricted to the highlands of Costa Rica and western Panama from around 2,200–3,000 m. It is tawny-colored overall, paler yellow on the belly, with two brownish wingbars, an orange lower mandible, and a peaked crest. Very similar to Tufted Flycatcher, but larger and longer-billed. Perches conspicuously on exposed snags at the edge of montane forests. Listen for its piercing “pee-pit!” song and pip calls."
0,Ochraceous Piculet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picumnus limae,https://ebird.org/species/ochpic1,"Tiny woodpecker endemic to northeast Brazil. Gray above and whitish-buff below, with a black cap spotted white. Males have a red forehead. Found in deciduous and semi-deciduous forest, second growth, and nearby tall dry shrubs (caatinga). Call a high-pitched “sirr-sirr-sirr” and a descending trill “driée driée driée...”"
0,Ochraceous Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Troglodytes ochraceus,https://ebird.org/species/ochwre1,"Tiny short-tailed wren, plain warm brown with brighter buffy face and bold buffy eyebrow. Found in highland forests, where it can be seen sneaking up tree trunks and through vine tangles in search of insects. Often follows mixed feeding flocks. Similar to House Wren, but note warmer color and eyebrow. Listen for song, a high-pitched musical jumble of tinkling notes and short trills."
0,Oilbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Steatornithidae,Steatornis caripensis,https://ebird.org/species/oilbir1,"This bizarre nocturnal fruit-eating bird is unlikely to be mistaken. It is entirely rufous-brown with small white spots on the wings, tail, and body. The pinkish bill is strongly hooked. Sexes similar. Breeds and roosts in colonies in caves or steep dark ravines. Difficult to find away from a known colony. Occasionally seen flying over the forest canopy at dawn or dusk, when it can be told from other crepuscular birds like nighthawks by its larger size, bulkier shape, and floppier flight style. Occurs from the lowlands up into the subtropical zone in the Andes, occasionally straying even higher. Makes a variety of strange clicking and shrieking noises."
0,Okarito Brown Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx rowi,https://ebird.org/species/okbkiw1,"A large, dark grayish brown kiwi with brownish streaking, often showing white patches on face. Restricted to native forest near Okarito in New Zealand, with small populations on predator-free Mana, Blumine, and Motuara islands. Often heard at night foraging as it sniffs loudly, tapping the ground for invertebrates. Male call is a series of clear rising whistles. Female call is a harsh throaty wail. Both sexes repeat their call many times, and sometimes call simultaneously. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Okinawa Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus okinawae,https://ebird.org/species/okirai1,"A candy-red bill, curving white head stripe, and lacey black-and-white striping make this a unique and attractive species. Found only in and around the Yanbaru Forest on Okinawa Island, where it forages on the forest floor, often in pairs or small flocks. Most frequently seen as it crosses roads, trails, and clearings. Gives a variety of different calls, typically given during dusk, dawn, or nighttime hours.

Dull brownish-olive overall with few distinctive features; look for pale eyering. Occurs singly or in pairs in the lower and middle levels of forests in lowlands and foothills, up to around 1,000 m. Often follows mixed-species flocks. Widespread but disjunct range stretching from eastern Panama to southeast Brazil."
0,Olivaceous Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Fraseria olivascens,https://ebird.org/species/olifly1,"A canopy flycatcher, often found high above the ground in areas with continuous forest, away from the forest edge. True to its name, this flycatcher is mostly olive-brown with a pale throat, a pale vent, and dark grayish legs. Distinguished from other African flycatchers by its preference for the canopy, its voice, and its overall indistinct coloration and patterning. Call is a high-pitched rising “tseee!” and the song is a complex jumble of clear whistles and buzzy notes."
0,Olivaceous Greenlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Hylophilus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/oligre1,"A small, vociferous vireo of east Andean cloud forest. Yellow underparts and crown, pale eye, and pinkish bill help separate it from other species in range. Usually stays high in the trees and sometimes follows mixed-species flocks. Sings frequently, belting out a squeaky and sometimes monotonous series of notes such as “twee-twee-twee…” or “soowe-soowe-soowe …”"
0,Olivaceous Piculet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picumnus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/olipic1,"Tiny woodpecker somewhat reminiscent of a nuthatch. Short, chisel-like bill and short tail. Plumage unremarkable, olive-brown above and paler below; note dark crown with small white spotting. Found in forested habitats, even around gardens and edges.

0,Olivaceous Siskin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Spinus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/olisis1,"Small, yellow finch found in cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes. Note yellow patches in wings and tail. Male has a black hood. Difficult to separate from Hooded Siskin except by range and habitat. Olivaceous Siskin is generally found at lower elevations and prefers taller, more humid forest. Male may appear slightly more golden than male Hooded Siskin, but this is hard to judge. Female is always yellow below, whereas most (but not all) female Hooded Siskins in the area of overlap are grayish below. Not all birds can be safely identified."
0,Olivaceous Thornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Chalcostigma olivaceum,https://ebird.org/species/olitho1,"Dark, short-billed hummingbird found at very high elevations in the Andes. Plumage is olive-green; adult male has a colorful “beard” that is reduced or lacking in females and immatures. It inhabits open grassland and areas with scattered shrubs above treeline.

0,Olive Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Iole viridescens,https://ebird.org/species/olibul1,"Small, dark brown bulbul with dirty-looking olive-yellow underparts. Combination of dark eyes and fairly uniform coloration distinguish this species from other, dull brown bulbuls. Inhabits lowland and hill forests, often clambering in dense tangled vegetation at mid to lower levels. Social, but shy and skulking. Gives an ascending two-part call: “chee-ik”."
0,Olive Bushshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Telophorus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/olibus1,"A bushshrike that has two color morphs: an easily identified “buff morph” that has a pink-fawn chest and throat, and an “olive morph” that has an olive crown and yellow-orange underparts. Females are duller than males, with less distinct facial masks. Singles and pairs often join mixed-species flocks in coastal and montane forest, thickets, and dense woodland. The species hops and creeps stealthily in the canopy and mid-canopy, foraging for insects and fruit. It typically sings a distinctive series of 10 to 15 short musical notes, and also gives a strident alarm call and metallic croaking notes."
0,Olive Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Arremon castaneiceps,https://ebird.org/species/olifin1,"A shy, stream-loving, finch-like bird of Andean cloud forest. Plumage is olive with a chestnut crown and gray face and throat. Sexes look alike.

Olive upperparts, yellowish-olive below and brighter yellow throat. Note the split yellow eye-ring and bicolored bill, black above and orange below. Similar to Yellow-legged Flycatcher but Olive Flyrobin has a yellow rather than white throat. Also similar to Lemon-bellied Flycatcher but Olive Flyrobin has a distinct eye-ring and is found in forest rather than savanna. Voice, and up-and-down, medium-pitch, whistled song and a thin “tseep” call."
0,Olive Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Lichmera argentauris,https://ebird.org/species/olihon1,"A nondescript sparrow-sized songbird with a slender, downcurved bill. Entirely olive-green above and uniform pale gray below, but note head pattern, which includes a prominent whitish smudge on the cheeks and dull bare skin below the eye. Juvenile has a pink facial patch. Singles, pairs, or groups inhabit scrubland, wooded areas, and coconut plantations in lowlands. Confined to islets in the Moluccas and to West Papua, where it is readily identified by its head pattern.

Note the black bare skin on the face, the ragged crest, and the bright green shoulders. Found in wet areas of the rainforest understory and locally in mangroves. Very shy and generally scarce. Similar in appearance to Spot-breasted Ibis, but larger and chunkier, with unspotted underparts, black facial skin, and a different call. Somewhat like Hadada Ibis, but slightly smaller overall, smaller-billed, and found in forest rather than in more open habitats. The vocalization is a two-part, honking “hee-haa,” similar to Hadada Ibis calls, but simpler."
0,Olive Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Xenopipo uniformis,https://ebird.org/species/oliman2,"An inconspicuous, small, green bird of the tepui highlands. Key marks are entirely olive-green plumage and yellowish eyering. Inhabits humid, mossy forest undergrowth on tepui slopes, most commonly above 800 m but occasionally lower. Generally solitary, quiet, and easily overlooked; most likely to be seen feeding at fruiting shrubs. Calls include a high, wheezing note that may rise and fall in pitch. Distinctive eyering should easily separate this species from other manakins at higher elevations in the tepuis. Below 800 m, told from Olivaceous Schiffornis by smaller size, shorter tail, and strongly olive-green plumage. Told from female Black Manakin by eyering and olive plumage."
0,Olive Oropendola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Psarocolius bifasciatus,https://ebird.org/species/olioro1,"Large, dark oropendola of mature rainforest. Olive green with reddish brown wings and a bright yellow tail. Bill is black with colorful pink patch at the base and an orange tip. More likely to be found in mature upland forest than the similar Russet-backed Oropendola of open habitats. Nests colonially, building large hanging nests in the crowns of tall trees in the canopy."
0,Olive Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Arremonops rufivirgatus,https://ebird.org/species/olispa,"A very plain sparrow found in dense brushy woodlands and weedy fields. Gray overall with dull greenish back. Look for obvious dark stripes on head, usually brownish but darker in western Mexico. Sexes are alike; young birds are buffier and streakier. Fairly common but shy and sometimes difficult to see well. Always on or near the ground. Primarily a Mexican species, with limited range in U.S. and an isolated population in Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Listen for song, a series of sharp notes that speeds up towards the end. Compare with brighter Green-backed Sparrow of the Yucatan Peninsula; especially note different voice."
0,Olive Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cranioleuca obsoleta,https://ebird.org/species/olispi1,"Restless long-tailed species with an olive-brown back, whitish chin, and buffy underparts. Note the whitish eyebrow, rusty wing patch, and rusty tail. Mostly found in the canopy of humid forests and second growth, including Araucaria forests, where it often accompany mixed-species flocks. The song is a repetitive and fast high-pitched series of “psee” notes, which gradually descends in a trill."
0,Olive Straightbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Timeliopsis fulvigula,https://ebird.org/species/olistr1,"A small honeyeater of mid-montane forest. All over olive plumage, richer on the chest. Straight, dagger-shaped bill with a pale line along the inside edge and orange eye. Joins mixed-species flocks in which it forages for insects. Similar to scrubwren species, but Olive Straightbill is slightly larger with olive rather than brown plumage, a paler eye and sharper bill. Voice, an incessant scolding call given whilst foraging."
0,Olive Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cyanomitra olivacea,https://ebird.org/species/eaosun1,"Large, dark, olive-green sunbird with a long, down-curved bill. Can show yellow tufts on the shoulders, though these are usually hidden. Found in forest and adjacent gardens and lush scrub. Usually in the understory. Less social than other sunbirds, and often seen alone. Most distinctive vocalization is a pretty, up-and-down series of clear notes. Mouse-colored Sunbird is similar, but Olive Sunbird is more olive-green than gray."
0,Olive-backed Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mitrospingidae,Mitrospingus oleagineus,https://ebird.org/species/olbtan1,"A bulky bird of tepui highlands, often encountered in groups. Unlikely to be confused within its limited range; plumage mostly coppery-olive (may tend toward yellow in sunlight) with a contrasting gray face and throat. Stout bill is silvery gray. Occurs in canopy of tepui highland forest, generally above 800 m, where groups forage noisily through vegetation, probing into epiphytes and dead leaves and hopping clumsily along branches, eating whatever is in their path. Frequents fruiting trees, and may join mixed-species flocks but are just as likely to be found away from them. Most typical call is a dreadful high-pitched screech, modulated as if the bird is being squeezed, and sounding quite literally like fingernails on a chalkboard."
0,Olive Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/olithr2,"A typical thrush with olive-brown upperparts and rufous underparts. Its taxonomic status remains under review, and it is most easily identified by range. In the north it is primarily a species of montane forest and forest edge, but farther south it occurs in gardens, woodland, plantations, and heath. It has a varied song, and often reveals its presence with typical thrush “chk-chk” or thin “tseeep” calls. An understory specialist that sometimes skulks, but at other times can be quite bold. Most similar thrushes do not overlap geographically. One that does is the Karoo Thrush, which differs from Olive Thrush in its gray (not rufous) flanks; its yellow-orange (not brown) eye-ring; its yellow (not dark brown) base to the upper mandible of the bill; and its less streaky throat."
0,Olive Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Peucedramidae,Peucedramus taeniatus,https://ebird.org/species/oliwar,"Small songbird of mountainous coniferous forests.

0,Pale Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/pabfly2,"A rather large flycatcher, usually found sitting still on a branch in the middle levels of dense forests. Male is pale blue overall with a pale gray belly. Immature Verditer Flycatcher can be similar, but is a greener shade of blue, has a pale eyering, and shows pale barring on the vent. Female Pale Blue Flycatcher is gray-brown with a white throat and belly and a slight ruddy tint to the tail; her general lack of warm coloration and size help distinguish her from other female flycatchers."
0,Pale Chanting-Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Melierax canorus,https://ebird.org/species/pacgos1,"A tall, long-tailed, pewter-gray hawk with pink-orange legs and bill base. In flight the wing pattern is strongly contrasting, with pale inner hind wings and a dark tip. Pairs inhabit thornveld, steppe, and desert below 2000 m. Chanting-goshawks give a strong gull-like “kleeeu” call, hence their name. Dark Chanting-Goshawk prefers moister woodland, has darker flight feathers creating a uniformly colored wing, and always has a gray-barred rump; Pale Chanting-Goshawk is paler, with pale panels in the wings and an unbarred white rump."
0,Pale Cicadabird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Edolisoma ceramense,https://ebird.org/species/pagcus1,"Male is a pale ashy-gray songbird with darker, pale-edged wings. Female is paler, especially underneath, and shows more extensive pale wing markings. Juvenile is still paler than female with faint breast streaking. Found in a variety of woods and forests in lowlands and foothills, where singles, pairs, or groups inhabit upper levels. Smaller than Black-faced, Moluccan, and Buru Cuckooshrikes, with a noticeably slimmer bill and much less black on the head. Differs from Wallacean Cuckooshrike in its paler appearance and in showing less black on face. Calls include a dry rattle, “grrrrrrrt,” a short single “chuck” call, and chattering phrases."
0,Pale Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Agricola pallidus,https://ebird.org/species/palfly2,"Fairly large, long-tailed, very plain flycatcher. Note the grayish underparts and unstreaked crown. Found in moist savanna and broadleaved woodland, including miombo. Sits in the midstory for long periods, occasionally flying out to grab an insect on the wing or on the ground. Call is a dry “cheeyp”, and song is a quick, scrambled series of similar notes.

0,Pallas's Fish-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Haliaeetus leucoryphus,https://ebird.org/species/pafeag1,"A pale-headed raptor of inland marshes and lakes. Tends to be uncommon and thinly distributed throughout its range. Adult is dark brown above with a paler belly and dirty-gray head. When in flight from below, a broad white band on the dark tail is the most eye-catching feature. Juveniles have an all-dark tail, but have two bright white panels on the undersides of the wingtips; this patterning can be similar to that of some kites, but the fish-eagle is much larger, with a longer-winged and comparatively shorter-tailed profile."
0,Pallas's Grasshopper Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Helopsaltes certhiola,https://ebird.org/species/pagwar1,"Furtive streaky brown warbler; typically buries itself deep in tangled vegetation and is very difficult to see. If seen well, note well-streaked upperparts, long wedge-shaped tail, and rufous rump. Only other well-streaked Locustella warbler in range is the smaller Lanceolated, which has a shorter tail and more extensive streaking on the underparts. Favors wet habitats; breeds in boggy taiga and vegetated riverbanks, winters in reedbeds and marshy fields. Clattering song reminiscent of reed warblers. Call a sharp “tik”; also gives a rapid-fire dry rattle."
0,Pallas's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Ichthyaetus ichthyaetus,https://ebird.org/species/gbhgul2,"Large powerful gull of saline, brackish, and fresh water bodies. Breeding adult has a black head with a thin incomplete crescent around the eye and a red-and-black-tipped bill. Nonbreeding adults retain a partial “hood” of patchy black on the back of the head. Young birds also have this dark patch, though it is much smaller in size. The eye crescents and a flashing white rump help to distinguish first-winter birds from Herring-type gulls. Can be readily separated by size in any plumage from the smaller dark-headed gulls."
0,Pallas's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus proregulus,https://ebird.org/species/palwar5,"Tiny, chunky, sprightly warbler with a short tail and a big head. Strong head pattern: three bright yellow stripes on an olive green head. Overlaps considerably with other similar leaf warblers throughout non-breeding range, so identification warrants caution; always note strong head pattern, bright yellow rump, and overall bright coloration. Very active while feeding, often hovering to pick insects from leaves. Joins mixed-species flocks. Breeds in coniferous and mixed forest in the Siberian taiga, and winters in a wide range of forested and semi-wooded habitats. Song complex and prolonged, a beautiful rambling series of clinking, chirping, trilling, and warbling with many repeated phrases. Call is a twangy “jwee.” Vagrants often turn up in trees on coastal headlands."
0,Pallas's Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus roseus,https://ebird.org/species/palros2,"Robust, stout-billed finch with a reddish rump and pale wingbars in all plumages. Adult male has a bright red breast and head, the latter of which is frosted with silvery spangling on the crown and throat. Female is brown with a white belly, a streaked breast, and an orangey-brown head. One of the only rosefinches in its range for the most part. Common Rosefinches are smaller-headed overall and males lack spangling on the head while females are plainer-brown with weaker streaking."

0,Pallid Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Leptotila pallida,https://ebird.org/species/paldov1,"A rather plain medium-sized dove, mostly restricted to western Ecuador but also occurs in western Colombia and extreme northwestern Peru. Within range, the main confusion species is White-tipped Dove. Pallid Dove has notably darker and warmer brown upperparts that contrast more with the whitish underparts. Like other members of the genus, Pallid is typically found on the ground (or flushing up into the understory). It is most often seen walking on roads or trails, or flying across quickly. There are a few places where it visits feeders. Within its limited range, it is fairly common, but be careful to separate from the equally (or more) common White-tipped Dove. Listen for its low-pitched, single “hoo” call."
0,Pallid Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus macrourus,https://ebird.org/species/palhar1,"Males are ghostly gray above with black wingtip wedges. Females more difficult to separate from other harriers; pay attention to the underwings with their barred primaries and dark secondaries. Juveniles are rufous and similar to Montagu’s, but appear dark rather than pale faced. In flight, a bit bulkier than Montagu’s but much more buoyant than Hen Harrier. Found in steppes, wet grassland, and agricultural areas. Breeds mainly in Eastern Europe but increasingly recorded in Western Europe."
0,Pallid Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator meliphilus,https://ebird.org/species/palhon1,"Small and nondescript honeyguide. Note the short but chunky bill and the white patches on the sides of the tail. Found along forest edge, in forest, and in thick woodland, where it is uncommon and inconspicuous. The main call is a slowly repeated “twee-ya.” Very similar to Least and Lesser Honeyguides, but has a smaller bill and a paler head that lacks a dark facial stripe.

A habitat generalist often found around palm trees and in open shrubby areas, gardens, and forest edges. Usually in pairs or small flocks, sometimes with other species. Often quite noisy and conspicuous; gives a series of sputtering squeaks or a single nasal “swee?”"
0,Palm Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga palmarum,https://ebird.org/species/palwar,"Subtly patterned brown-and-yellow warbler, known for constantly bobbing its tail. Often forages on the ground, unlike most other warblers. Breeding plumage shows a rufous cap. In fall and winter, look for pale eyebrow and dark line through the eye, diffuse streaks on underparts, and bright yellow undertail coverts. Two populations: “Western” is browner overall, brightest on the undertail coverts; “Yellow” is more suffused with yellow overall; they overlap extensively in range, especially during fall migration. Breeds in bogs and clearings in the boreal forest. In migration, found in a variety of open, shrubby habitats.

The white corners of the dark tail are conspicuous during its weak, fluttering flight. Found in grassland with some bushes and trees. Similar to Yellow-throated Longclaw, though there is only minor overlap in range; orange-throated birds are easily identified, but some individuals have a yellow throat, and these can be separated by their paler and much more heavily streaked flanks. Brownish immatures can be confused with pipits, but are larger and more robust. Not very vocal, but gives a high-pitched whistle and a simple song of doubled phrases."
0,Pantepui Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus murinus,https://ebird.org/species/bkbthr4,"A drab thrush, found only in tepuis. Nondescript grayish-brown with a pale whitish belly. Note pale throat with indistinct streaking. Sexes similar. Usually seen singly or in pairs.

0,Papuan Parrotfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Erythrura papuana,https://ebird.org/species/pappar1,"A rather attractive small finch, mostly pale green with a red tail and a dull bluish-purple face. Found in evergreen forest and forest edge from 1200 to 2600 meters of elevation, rarely lower. Blue-faced Parrotfinch is similar but slightly smaller, with a slighter bill and more vivid coloration. The two do not often, if ever, overlap. Papuan’s common call is a thin, weak high-pitched “tsit tsit.”"
0,Papuan Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Erythropitta macklotii,https://ebird.org/species/pappit1,"A distinctive plump, short-tailed, long-legged bird with a bold red belly. Note the rusty nape, black throat, broad blue chest band bordered below with a thick black line, and greenish upperparts. Singles or pairs forage on the forest floor or call from a low perch within forest and secondary growth. More abundant in the lowlands but also occurs in the foothills. No similar species in range. Song is typical of the genus, with a quivering, rising first note and a falling, mournful second whistle: “waaaaop-aaaaaawoo.”"
0,Papuan Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Drymodes beccarii,https://ebird.org/species/papscr2,"A medium-sized, long-tailed bird of foothill and lower montane forest floor.

Unmistakable if seen well. Voice, a long, high-pitch, piping."
0,Papuan Scrubwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Sericornis papuensis,https://ebird.org/species/papscr1,"A small bird of upper montane forest understory. Brown upperparts, rufous wing and tail, pale brown underparts and a pale brown to gray eye. Note the dark spot in the wing with pale base to the flight feathers, buffy eye-ring and forehead. Searches for insects in small groups. Similar to Large Scrubwren, but Papuan is smaller and lacks the rusty face. Also similar to Buff-faced Scrubwren, but Papuan is usually higher elevation and lacks the gray crown. Song, a repeated, cheerful, whistled phrase."
0,Papuan Sittella,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Neosittidae,Daphoenositta papuensis,https://ebird.org/species/varsit1,"Tiny, short-tailed bird with a thin, slightly upturned bill. All plumages show yellow eyering and heavy dark streaks on the back and belly. Different subspecies vary tremendously in head pattern, ranging from black-headed to white-headed, streaked to unstreaked. Inhabits montane rainforest, where usually seen in small flocks that methodically clamber along tree trunks, probing for insects in bark. Birds give frequent “chip-chip” call as they forage."
0,Papuan Spinetailed Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Mearnsia novaeguineae,https://ebird.org/species/papnee1,"A small, short-tailed swift over lowland forest and open areas. Stubby-body, pale belly contrasting with short, dark, square tail. Distinguished from other swiftlets by distinctive cut-out in the base of the hindwing and also translucent base to the flight feathers. Less soaring and more ‘twitchy’ flight than other swiftlet species. Voice, typical swiftlike chips, screeches and chatters."
0,Papuan Treecreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Climacteridae,Cormobates placens,https://ebird.org/species/paptre1,"A medium-sized creeping bird of montane forest. Mainly a dull, gray-brown color with pale flecks on the flanks, a paler throat. Female has a rufous moustache stripe. The only treecreeper on New Guinea. Climbs up a trunk, then flies down to the base of another trunk. Sometimes followed by a fantail. The only other similar colored birds with this behaviour are the sittellas, which are distinctively smaller and most have a streaked back. Call, a level series of piping notes which increase in volume."
0,Papuan Whipbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Psophodidae,Androphobus viridis,https://ebird.org/species/papwhi1,"A rare and little known, medium-sized bird of montane forests. Overall olive-green plumage with a longish tail which is often held cocked. Male has a black throat and chest with a white moustache stripe. Usually in pairs and very skulking. Similar to female Fan-tailed Berrypecker, but Papuan Whipbird lacks the paler belly, white in the tail, side streak and pale around the base of the bill. Voice, a rising whistle similar to a jewel-babbler, and a quiet scolding note."
0,Papyrus Canary,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra koliensis,https://ebird.org/species/papcan1,"This canary is typical in its appearance but unusual in its papyrus-dwelling habits. The male and female are similar but the male is more boldly marked, especially on the face. Found in papyrus swamp and adjacent habitats. Uncommon and inconspicuous. The song is a complex mix of quiet twitters and whistles. Similar to Western Citril, but separated by the lack of a yellow eyebrow. Extremely similar to Southern Citril, and best separated by the more bulging, pinkish bill."

The duller immature has orange underparts and a gray crown. Found in papyrus swamps, where it skulks with great skill. The male gives ringing “chonk” or “chuwee” notes, often in rapid-fire or up-and-down series. The female gives a low ratcheting call which is sometimes given in a duet alongside the male’s vocalizations. Similar to Black-headed Gonolek, but has a yellow crown and a white wingbar."
0,Papyrus Yellow-Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Calamonastides gracilirostris,https://ebird.org/species/paywar1,"Mid-sized, long-billed warbler, with rich yellow underparts and an olive-green back. The underparts often show an orange tint. Found in papyrus swamp. Very localized and poorly known species. The song consists of simple repeated phrases and is easily missed. Other yellow-warblers are similar but have different songs, lack orange tones to the underparts, and are found in different habitats."
0,Paradise Jacamar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Galbulidae,Galbula dea,https://ebird.org/species/parjac1,"Unmistakable. Fairly common and widespread across much of Amazonia. Very long pointed tail and long straight bill lend to its distinctive silhouette. Overall dark glossy-black with a white throat. Wings are iridescent blue-green in good light. Sexes similar. Unlike most other jacamars, tends to perch conspicuously on open branches in the canopy, often in pairs. Typically found around clearings or at the edge of mature lowland forest, even along roadsides."

Males display from a prominent branch, holding both wings high above their heads."
0,Paradise Shelduck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Tadorna variegata,https://ebird.org/species/parshe1,"Large, colorful duck, endemic to New Zealand. Sexes told apart by head color; male has a black head with slight green iridescence, female has a white head and upper neck. Note the large white wing patch on the outer wing of both sexes in flight. Widely distributed throughout New Zealand. Utilizes rivers, wetlands, and lakes, as well as open grassy areas and farmland. Noisy; males give loud honking alarm calls, while females are higher-pitched. Found in pairs or in large flocks, especially post-breeding. Distinguishable from vagrant Australian Shelducks by absence of white neck ring, chestnut or buff breast, and black undertail."
0,Paradise Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Tangara chilensis,https://ebird.org/species/partan1,"Small, stunningly colorful tanager of Amazonian lowlands. Bright green head contrasts with red, blue, and black body. Sexes alike. Often quite common within its range. Found in the canopy of humid forest, often in mixed-species flocks. Likes to stay high in the canopy, but occasionally moves lower into the midstory, moving quickly between perches as it forages."
0,Parakeet Auklet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Aethia psittacula,https://ebird.org/species/parauk,"Dumpy, medium-sized alcid with a bright orange bill. Pale button eye and upturned gape give it a distinctly maniacal, smiling appearance. Blackish above and white below, with a long white “whisker” extending down from behind the eye in breeding season; in wintering birds, white extends up onto the throat. Clean white belly distinguishes this species from other similar auklets. Least Auklet has a similar color scheme but is half the size, has white cheeks in non-breeding plumage, and has white-mottled upperparts when breeding. Parakeet Auklet breeds on offshore island colonies, often with other auklet species; it winters offshore."
0,Paramillo Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus canus,https://ebird.org/species/partap1,"A poorly known tapaculo found at high elevations near tree line in the northern reaches of Colombia’s western Andes. It was formerly considered a race of the more widespread Paramo Tapaculo. Adult is uniform gray, lacking obvious markings and without the brown coloration found on many other Andean tapaculos. Young birds are brown and heavily barred. Inhabits tangled understory of stunted forest and clumps of small bushes. Song is a long series of buzzy notes that is steady in pace but descends gradually in pitch."
0,Paramo Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus bogotensis,https://ebird.org/species/parpip1,"A nondescript buffy-brown bird found in high elevation grasslands and farmland from western Venezuela to Bolivia. Occurs from around 2,500 to 4,500 m. Upperparts have prominent dark streaking, but underparts are mostly clean buffy with only limited streaking on the upper breast and neck sides. Legs and bill are pinkish. Usually seen singly, walking on the ground or occasionally perched on a small shrub or fencepost. The only pipit in much of its range (north of central Peru); southward, note cleaner underparts (especially flanks) than possible confusion species like Hellmayr’s Pipit."
0,Paramo Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Catamenia homochroa,https://ebird.org/species/parsee1,"This rare seedeater is most often found around bamboo at the scrubby edge of temperate zone forest, up to near treeline in the Andes. Disjunct populations are also found in the Santa Marta Mountains in Colombia and the Venezuelan tepuis. The male is dark slaty gray with a blacker face, a contrasting pale pinkish bill, and rufous undertail coverts. Females are paler and browner than males, with dark streaks on the back. Note the warmer rufous undertail coverts and pale bill on females. Can be found singly, in pairs, or small groups, occasionally following a mixed-species flock through the understory. Compare with Plain-colored Seedeater, which is often found in more open grassy habitats."
0,Paramo Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus opacus,https://ebird.org/species/partap2,"Small, mouse-like bird found at very high elevations in the Andes. Inhabits scrub and edge of elfin forest. Male is mostly dark gray; female has brown upperparts and gray underparts. Both sexes have very faint barring on lower underparts. Similar to several other species of tapaculos, and best identified by range, elevation, habitat, and voice. Song is a dry, cicada-like rattle that usually lasts two to six seconds, and then repeated again after a pause. Skulks in dense vegetation, usually close to the ground."
0,Crested Berrypecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paramythiidae,Paramythia montium,https://ebird.org/species/creber1,"A medium-sized bird of upper-montane forest and shrubland. Mainly slaty-gray color with olive or green back and yellow lower belly and sides. Note the black face, chest and crest which it can hold up or down. Also note the striking white mark from above the eye to the back of the head. Often joins mixed flocks. Not likely to be confused with any other species. Sometimes split into Eastern and Western. Voice, various scratchy calls or a nasal “wek!”."
0,Parasitic Jaeger,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius parasiticus,https://ebird.org/species/parjae,"Slender gull-like seabird; the middle-sized of the three jaegers. Breeds on Arctic tundra; spends the rest of the year at sea. Difficult to separate from other jaegers. Breeding adults have a long pointed tail (not as long as Long-tailed Jaeger). Plumage varies from entirely dark blackish-brown to paler with white belly and yellowish on the side of the neck. Immature birds are variable but usually warm brown with cinnamon barring on wings. Barring on underwing and undertail is weaker than on Pomarine Jaeger. Shape and flight style are intermediate between Pomarine and Long-tailed. Typically shows white shafts on four to six outermost wing feathers, more than Long-tailed, but less than Pomarine. Bill is relatively long and slender. All jaegers chase other birds and steal their food."
0,Pardusco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Nephelornis oneilli,https://ebird.org/species/pardus2,"An odd, warbler-like bird found near treeline in the Andes of northern and central Peru. Pardusco means “brownish” in Spanish, and that fits the bird very well. It is best identified by its lack of field marks, its small and pointy bill, and its specialized habitat. Behavior is also a good clue, as it is typically found in little flocks that chatter and squeak as they move through elfin forest, often accompanied by other species."
0,Paria Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Arremon phygas,https://ebird.org/species/sthbrf7,"Range-restricted striking sparrow with black head and gray eyebrow. Back and tail olive-yellow, underparts gray; black band across chest.

Song and calls are repetitive and very high-pitched. No similar species in range. Endemic to the Turimiquire and Paria regions of northeastern Venezuela."
0,Parker's Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacroides parkeri,https://ebird.org/species/parant2,"Fairly small, long-tailed, plain antbird endemic to Colombia. Male is all gray with some white fringes on the wing feathers and tip of tail. Female is dull brown above and cinnamon below without wing or tail markings. Found in understory of subtropical forest and edge, where pairs are usually quite skulky and difficult to see. Very similar to Dusky Antbird, but Parker’s is found at higher elevations, around 1,100–1,800 m, and has very different song."
0,Parker's Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cranioleuca vulpecula,https://ebird.org/species/parspi1,"Rusty above with pale brown underparts, a whitish throat, and a long spiky tail. Occurs on shrubby river islands favoring early successional vegetation. Song is an accelerating and descending series of “tew” notes, ending in a trill. The rather similar Rusty-backed Spinetail has buffy underparts, a less distinct eyebrow, and a different song, and occurs in seasonally flooded forests and gallery forests."
0,Parodi's Hemispingus,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Kleinothraupis parodii,https://ebird.org/species/parhem1,"Small olive-yellow tanager with a dingy brown face and crown and a yellow eyebrow. Found in humid elfin forest in the southern Peruvian Andes, where it forages singly or in pairs, often joining mixed-species flocks with other tanagers, flowerpiercers, and hemispinguses. Compared to the smaller Citrine and Pale-legged Warblers, note the blunter gray bill (black and thin in the warblers), larger size, and bolder behavior."
0,Parrot Crossbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxia pytyopsittacus,https://ebird.org/species/parcro2,"Bull-necked, big-headed crossbill with a deep and heavy bill, otherwise identical to Common Crossbill. Males are red; females and juveniles greenish. Deeper call notes ""chup, chup"" subtly different from Red Crossbill. Occurs mainly in mature and tall coniferous forests, especially pine forests, although may be found in spruce and conifer plantations during periodic irruptions following pine-cone crop failure."
0,Partridge Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Geophaps smithii,https://ebird.org/species/parpig1,"Medium-sized pigeon, usually seen on the ground in open woodland or along roadsides in northwestern Northern Territory and the northern Kimberley in Western Australia. Plain brown plumage, with white stripe along the edge of the breast. Distinctive facial markings, with comical red (Northern Territory) or yellow (Western Australia) facial skin. Takes flight with a loud clatter of wings. Compare Squatter Pigeon, Flock Bronzewing (with black-and-white facial markings), and both Chestnut-quilled and White-quilled Rock-Pigeons (with pale wing panels)."

0,Patagonian Forest Earthcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Upucerthia saturatior,https://ebird.org/species/pafear1,"Rather local breeder in drier Patagonian areas with open forest and shrubby slopes. Migrates across the Andes to winter in Chile, where it is found in matorral and other shrubby habitats. Often rather skulking. Very similar to Scale-throated Earthcreeper of the Andes and southern Patagonia, but limited range overlap. Patagonian Forest Earthcreeper averages darker with bolder pale eyebrow, slightly shorter and darker bill, and a different song. Also compare with Buff-winged Cinclodes, which has shorter and straight bill."
0,Patagonian Mockingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus patagonicus,https://ebird.org/species/patmoc1,"Fairly common in Argentine Patagonia, but local and scarce in southern Chile. Favors semiopen habitats, from shrub-steppe to farmland with hedges and shrubby patches. Often perches atop bushes and on roadside wires and posts. Runs well on the ground, usually with tail cocked; at times can be rather elusive, skulking in bushes. Identified by bold pale eyebrow, buffy-gray underparts, white wingbars, and white tail corners; compare with White-banded Mockingbird, which has much more white in wings and tail."

Despite the name, not really a bird of dry Patagonian habitats. Often in groups, especially in winter, and feeds from the ground to high in trees. Male has a gray hood and distinctive golden back. Female and immature are similar to Gray-hooded Sierra-Finch, but are more extensively yellow below and the whisker marks are weaker."
0,Patagonian Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Tinamotis ingoufi,https://ebird.org/species/pattin1,"Large, cryptically patterned chickenlike bird of Patagonian grasslands with bushes and low shrubs. Scarce and rarely encountered. Like related tinamous of open habitats, most often in trios or family groups (males take care of the young). Runs strongly in preference to flying (in flight note bright rusty wings). Striped head (without a crest) and spotted upperparts are diagnostic plumage features; only other tinamou in its range is the rather different Elegant Crested-Tinamou. Loud haunting whistles carry well, but the sound is easily whipped away in the wind."
0,Patagonian Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Colorhamphus parvirostris,https://ebird.org/species/pattyr2,"Rather plain but subtly attractive little flycatcher best known in migration and winter, when it occurs widely in gardens, parks, and open woodlands, often with fruiting shrubs. In summer, inhabits temperate native rainforest where it often stays rather high in the trees and is easily overlooked. Found as singles and pairs in summer, but sometimes small flocks in winter. No similar species in range: note the rounded head with dark cheek patch and rusty wingbars."
0,Patagonian Yellow-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sicalis lebruni,https://ebird.org/species/payfin1,"Fairly common to uncommon, but often rather local in Patagonian steppe and grassland, often with nearby stony areas and low banks or bluffs. Found in pairs or flocks, and like other yellow-finches feeds mainly on the ground. Both sexes rather drab, but distinctive in range (no overlap with other species of yellow-finches). Yellow on male strongest on throat; female can appear drab and colorless, with yellow wash on belly often hard to see."

Slightly curved bill pale at base. Look for dense breast streaking with abrupt border at white belly. Males are much larger than females, and have a large air sac in the throat which they inflate during breeding display. Plumage and yellow legs might recall Least Sandpiper, but Pectoral is much larger and looks longer-necked. Compare with Sharp-tailed Sandpiper, which is brighter overall and has a more distinct dark cap. Breeds on tundra in the high Arctic. Winters mainly in southern South America, but small numbers also winter in Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.

Readily confused with significantly larger Ameline Swiftlet, but present species has a more squared-off-looking tail (fork is shallow and often unnoticeable), tends to fly lower and more erratically, and more often forms flocks. Combination of dark rump, unglossed dark back, and medium size separates this species from Gray-rumped Swiftlet, Pygmy Swiftlet, and Ridgetop Swiftlet. Frequently calls while in flight, giving a squeaky chattering twitter."
0,Philippine Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Harpactes ardens,https://ebird.org/species/phitro1,"A fairly large, long-tailed bird of lowland and low-elevation montane forest. Brown on the back, with barred wings, a white undertail, a yellow bill with blue at the base, and blue bare skin around the eye. Female has mustard-yellow underparts and an olive-brown head, whereas the spectacular male has a black head, a pink chest, and a red belly. Unmistakable. The only species of trogon in the Philippines. Song is a descending series that first accelerates, then decelerates."
0,Oriental Bay-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Tytonidae,Phodilus badius,https://ebird.org/species/orbowl1,"Small owl with a distinctive, highly angular head. Dark chestnut above and pale creamy gray below with light spotting on the sides. Dark eyes are emphasized by the general paleness of the face and the vertical dark ridges above them which form into small rounded tufts. Typically stands quite upright, giving it a heavy-headed appearance. Small and often difficult to find but can be common in a wide range of habitats, including evergreen forests and mangroves. Vocalizations are variable, and include rasps, screams, inflected gulping hoots, and a high-pitched mellow whistled song with the first few notes downslurred and the last few notes upslurred, which can be likened to “hii-huu-huu-huwee-huwee-huwee”."
0,Phoenix Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma alba,https://ebird.org/species/phopet1,"A long-winged petrel, predominantly dark with a gleaming white belly. Throat patch often shows pale speckling, and birds sometimes appear distinctly pale-throated. Key identification feature is the prominent pale bar at the leading edge of the dark underwing between the elbow and body. Similar in pattern to Tahiti Petrel, but much smaller-billed and sometimes shows a pale throat. Usually flies with wings bent at the elbow, unlike the remarkably straight-winged Tahiti Petrel. Silent at sea."
0,Piapiac,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Ptilostomus afer,https://ebird.org/species/piapia1,"A unique, slender magpie-like bird with a long narrowing tail and a chunky bill. Adults are uniform glossy black; immatures have black-tipped pink bills. Resident in open savanna with palms, in cultivated areas, and in rural villages. Forages on the ground in groups, often near larger mammals including domestic stock, walking on the ground or riding on the back of the mammal. Also perches in treetops and palms when roosting or resting. Loaded with character. Groups sometimes become garrulous when calling to each other, mostly giving piping high-pitched starling-like “cheeet” calls."
0,Picazuro Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Patagioenas picazuro,https://ebird.org/species/picpig2,"A common pigeon frequently seen in a range of habitats from urban areas to savannas and light woodlands.

Breeding male is very handsome; warm brown overall with a bright white cheek patch and crown. Breeding female has largely white underparts and a dirtier white ear with a gray cast on her back. Wintering adults are darker and streakier, but retain the head patterning. Immature birds can be confusing, as they lack the large white cheek patch,and may be confused with Rustic Bunting; look out for a weaker crest, faint streaking on the belly, and a gray ear patch with a white dot near the end."
0,Pine Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax affinis,https://ebird.org/species/pinfly1,"Small flycatcher of pine-oak forest and edge in highlands; often in clearings and orchards with small deciduous trees (often not in pines). Other Empidonax flycatchers occur alongside Pine Flycatcher, especially very similar Dusky and Hammond’s Flycatchers, which are winter migrants. On Pine, note the bright pale teardrop-shaped eyering similar to Hammond’s and an entirely pale orangish underside to the bill (like Cordilleran Flycatcher, which is greener and has a broader bill ). Call is a rather quiet “pwip,” somewhat similar to Dusky but very distinct from Hammond’s."
0,Pine Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Pinicola enucleator,https://ebird.org/species/pingro,"Large, plump finch of the boreal forest.

In breeding plumage look for thin broken black collar across chest, black stripe across forehead, orange legs, and orange bill with black tip. Nonbreeding and immature birds have black bills and sandy-colored breastbands. White wingstripe visible in flight. Notably paler than other small plovers, with the exception of Snowy, from which Piping is distinguished by thicker bill and orange legs. Sometimes seen near other shorebirds, but rarely ventures far from the high, dry side of the beach. Often quite vocal; gives a sad-sounding two-parted whistle that drops in pitch: ""pwee-doo."" A species of great conservation concern, due to coastal development and disturbance at nesting sites on beaches."
0,Pipipi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mohouidae,Mohoua novaeseelandiae,https://ebird.org/species/pipipi1,"A small, noisy songbird endemic to New Zealand, found on the South and Stewart Islands. Favors myriad forest types. Note brown upperparts with an ashy-gray face and neck, and pale creamy-brown underparts. Often located first by its harsh chattering contact calls and canary-like song. Forms fast-moving flocks in the canopy that will come down to investigate “squeaking.” Associates with other species such as Silvereye and Gray Gerygone in the non-breeding season, forming noisy, continuously chattering flocks. Pipipi is the main host of the parasitic Long-tailed Koel, and so adults can be encountered feeding a much larger Koel chick. Distinguished from Dunnock by lighter underparts; does not feed on the ground. Look for sharp contrast between gray face and lighter underparts and larger size to distinguish from Gray Gerygone."
0,Piratic Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Legatus leucophaius,https://ebird.org/species/pirfly1,"Found in tropical lowlands and foothills, migratory in northern part of its range.

0,Principe Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis ornatus,https://ebird.org/species/prgsta1,"A large, chunky, dark starling. In poor light, looks black, but good light reveals purple, green, blue, and copper iridescence. Most of the glossy coloration is on the upperparts, while the underparts are duller, appearing blackish with bronze highlights. Common in humid forest, plantations, and secondary habitats on the island of Principe. Usually in small flocks. Similar to Splendid Starling, but separated by the bronzy rather than purplish underparts. Gives a wide variety of scolding, rasping, squealing, and liquid notes."
0,Pringle's Puffback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Dryoscopus pringlii,https://ebird.org/species/pripuf1,"A small bushshrike in which males and females are strikingly different.

Similar to Black-backed and Northern Puffbacks, but noticeably smaller, with a pale base to the bill. The most common vocalization is an explosive, repeated “kweea,” but the species also gives scolding and ratcheting calls."
0,Pririt Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis pririt,https://ebird.org/species/pribat1,"A cute, dumpy, colorful flycatcher-like bird. Sexes differ: the male has a black chest band, a short white eyebrow, and a white throat; the distinctive female has a mostly uniform sandy beige throat and breast, and a white wingbar. Pairs often join mixed-species flocks, actively hover-gleaning and hawking insects in riverine woodland in semi-desert and arid savanna. The species makes clicks by snapping its bill; also gives a monotonous series of piping “tseeep” notes that slowly descends in pitch, as well as a croaking “krunk.” The male Pririt Batis is very similar to the larger Chinspot Batis, but it differs by having a narrower chest band, often dark-speckled flanks, and a different call."

Widespread and fairly common, breeding on high Arctic tundra and wintering on coastlines around the globe, as far south as Tierra del Fuego. Most numerous on beaches and mudflats; less common inland. Occurs in flocks, often mixed with other shorebirds. Compare with larger, lankier, longer-billed Great Knot in Asia and Australia. Feeds on a variety of small invertebrates; West Atlantic population reliant on horseshoe crab eggs during spring migration."
0,Red Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Calendulauda burra,https://ebird.org/species/ferlar2,"A medium-large, chunky lark that has a rounded head lacking a crest, a short strong bill, a bold face pattern, and a heavily blotched chest. Color often matches the prevailing soil color in the region, varying from brick-red in areas of red sand dunes to rusty-brown in areas of shale and clay plains. Pairs are localized residents in the semi-arid Karoo, preferring dunes and sandy areas. Males sing from bushes, and in spring have a protracted aerial display 10 to 15 meters up in the air, with deep wingbeats and fanned tail. The call is a strident series of repeated “triiiiik” notes, and song a distinctive brief warble that is often repeated at short intervals. The Karoo Lark is smaller, browner, and daintier than the Red Lark, with a higher-pitched, faster song."
0,Red Lory,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Eos bornea,https://ebird.org/species/redlor1,"A spectacular red parrot with an orange bill, scattered dark purple-blue wing markings, a blue base to the undertail, and a dark tail. Juveniles are duller, with less blue. Found in pairs or small groups in the upper levels of forests, mangroves, and plantations within lowlands and foothills. Differs from Blue-eared Lory in the less extensive dark color to the base of the undertail and the absence of blue cheek markings. Noisy, giving harsh shrieks mostly in flight: “EEK” notes and two-tone “kirup” calls."
0,Red Myzomela,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Myzomela cruentata,https://ebird.org/species/redmyz1,"A beautiful small vivid-red myzomela with a slightly dark patch in front of the eyes. Female has distinctive plumage that is mostly olive with a reddish face, a red rump, and a reddish tail. Found in primary rainforest and forest edge as well as secondary growth, mainly above 600 meters of elevation but sometimes below. Unique coloration separates it from similar species, the male being entirely red, the female having the diagnostic reddish rump and tail. Vocally shy. Common call is a repeated high-pitched, insect-like “tseet.”"
0,Red Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Tytonidae,Tyto soumagnei,https://ebird.org/species/marowl1,"A rare and enigmatic owl that is endemic to Madagascar. Unlikely to be seen unless you are expressly searching for it. Found in eastern rainforest, and very locally in dry deciduous forest in the north. Call is a spine-chilling screech that drops at the end. Similar to Barn Owl, but much more rufous overall, especially on the back, which never shows gray tones."
0,Red Phalarope,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Phalaropus fulicarius,https://ebird.org/species/redpha1,"The chunkiest and thickest-billed phalarope. Of the three phalaropes, Red is the least likely to be seen inland. Breeding females are brighter and more contrasting than males: note bright body the color of tomato juice, with black cap and white cheek. Males are colored like watered-down tomato juice, with a streaky cap. Also look for yellow bill with dark tip. Nonbreeding is much less colorful: smooth gray above and white below with a black ear patch. Juveniles are dark above and stained with buffy tones; they molt quickly into nonbreeding plumage. Breeds on Arctic tundra. Primarily found on the open ocean during migration and winter; rare inland. Usually in small flocks, but can gather in larger numbers, often in mixed flocks with Red-necked Phalarope. Red is best distinguished by larger size, thicker bill, and slightly paler, smoother-looking upperparts."
0,Red Shoveler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula platalea,https://ebird.org/species/redsho1,"Distinctive dabbling duck: combination of very large, slightly shovel-shaped black bill and and pale blue forewing patches (brighter on male) identify all plumages. Male has a pale gray head with pale yellow eyes and a “red” body with black spots. Female is mottled brown overall, but note white sides to pointed tail, big black bill. Fairly common in wetlands and at lakes, river mouths, and sewage lagoons. Unlike many dabbling ducks, often rather quiet."
0,Red Siskin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Spinus cucullatus,https://ebird.org/species/redsis1,"A small bird with a unique color pattern. Red-and-black plumage of male is diagnostic; female is salmon-pink and gray. Found in a variety of habitats across its range, including savanna bush islands, forest edge, and disturbed humid premontane forest, but it is generally absent from humid lowland forest regions. Feeds on seeds and fruit, often associating with euphonias. May wander widely and can be difficult to find; population has been greatly reduced by trapping for the cage bird trade. Song is a jumbled series of high-pitched notes, trills, and buzzes; most readily detected by high, clear call note."
0,Red Spurfowl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Galloperdix spadicea,https://ebird.org/species/redspu1,"Slightly smaller than a domestic chicken, but longer bodied and reddish in color. Females have more barring on the upperparts than males. It is a bird of dry and moist forests as well as well-wooded villages. Males have a distinctive, rapidly repeated “k-r-r-r-kwek, kr-kr-kwek, kr-kr-kwek” call, often delivered in the mornings and evenings. When flushed males and females give a harsh, cackling “kuk-kuk-kuk-kukaak.” Forages in the undergrowth and is generally secretive, but often seen crossing roads or walking down paths in pairs or small groups. Birds from northern India are more buffish-gray while birds of southern India are darker."
0,Red-billed Pied Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mitrospingidae,Lamprospiza melanoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/rbptan1,"Social, black-and-white bird of rainforest canopy. Combination of pied plumage and red bill is diagnostic. Always seen at the uppermost levels of tall rainforest in groups of 4–10 individuals, ranging noisily through the canopy and moving from one emergent tree to the next. Often perches on bare branches but seldom remains in one place for long. Forages deliberately, hopping along branches and taking both insects and fruit. Often associates with other species, but tends to remain on the periphery of mixed-species canopy flocks, sometimes flying off long distances and returning. More often heard than seen; calls include a mixture of slurred and musical doubled notes. Calls are sharp, far carrying, and distinctive once learned."
0,Red Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Cardellina rubra,https://ebird.org/species/redwar1,"Unmistakable, active, bright-red little bird endemic to highlands in Mexico. Favors humid conifer forest, pine-oak forest, and adjacent brushy areas; fairly common. Usually in pairs, foraging at all levels, often moving with mixed-species feeding flocks. Cheek patch is white in central and southern Mexico and silvery gray in northwest Mexico. No similar species."
0,Red Wattlebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Anthochaera carunculata,https://ebird.org/species/redwat1,"Large, gray-brown, streaked honeyeater with small pink flaps of facial skin (wattles) and a bright yellow lower belly. Adult has black crown, red eye with white patch below, yellow belly, and streaking across neck, back, and breast. Juvenile is more uniformly brown, with less defined facial wattles. This species is found in a wide variety of habitats across southern mainland Australia. It can be quite aggressive and typically chases smaller species away from flowering trees. Has a wide variety of loud, harsh vocalizations, many of which are familiar noises across southern Australia."
0,Reddish Egret,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Egretta rufescens,https://ebird.org/species/redegr,"An entertaining heron to watch—known for sprinting, jumping, and spinning around in shallow water with its wings held up. Dark morph is more common than white morph. Adults are dark gray with a rusty head and neck. Immatures are paler grayish and rusty overall. In breeding plumage, the pink bill and blue lores can become shockingly bright. White morphs are similar to other egrets, but note behavior, grayish legs, and pink bill base (adults). Found exclusively near the coast, especially on mudflats. Typically uncommon, usually seen singly or in scattered small numbers. Dark morph most easily confused with Little Blue Heron, but Reddish Egret is larger and forages much more actively."
0,Reddish Hermit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Phaethornis ruber,https://ebird.org/species/redher1,Tiny and charismatic hermit hummingbird. Note a very contrasting black mask. Dark-olive above and cinnamon below and on the rump. Males have an incomplete black breast band and a shorter tail and wings than females. Common in the lower strata of forests and forest edges where it is fond of Heliconia flowers.
0,Reddish Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus rufescens,https://ebird.org/species/resowl1,"Small owl with large, dark red eyes and soft ear tufts. Like many other small owls, far more often heard than seen; listen for its quiet whistled hoots, given at approximately 10-second intervals. If seen, note its pale yellow bill and very lightly-speckled underparts. Found in lowland and foothill forest."
0,Redhead,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya americana,https://ebird.org/species/redhea,"This attractive diving duck often gathers by the thousands on lakes or bays in the winter. Males have cinnamon-colored head, yellow eye, and gray body. Females are plain brown overall, a lighter blond color than scaup and Ring-necked Duck. Also note evenly rounded head shape. About the size of Greater Scaup, but slightly larger than Lesser Scaup and Ring-necked Duck—this can be helpful when they are together in mixed flocks. Best separated from Canvasback by head and bill shape and male’s darker gray body. Breeds on marshy freshwater ponds and lakes; winters in flocks on any large body of water, often mixed with other diving ducks. Dives frequently to reach submerged aquatic vegetation."
