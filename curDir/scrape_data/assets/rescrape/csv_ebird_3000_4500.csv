0,Duida Grass-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Emberizoides duidae,https://ebird.org/species/dugfin1,"Slender, long-tailed bird found only from Cerro Duida, a tepui (table mountain) in southern Venezuela. It is so remote and inaccessible that the bird has not been observed by ornithologists since the original specimens were collected in the 1920s. It has olive-green wings, brownish breast, pale throat, yellow bill, and dark streaking on the back and crown. Very similar to Wedge-tailed Grass-Finch, but slightly larger. Inhabits grassy savanna, and voice is unknown."
0,Duida Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Lepidocolaptes duidae,https://ebird.org/species/linwoo4,"Medium-sized woodcreeper with a slender, curved bill. Combination of bill shape and unstreaked upperparts separate it from other woodcreepers. It is one of several species formerly known as Lineated Woodcreeper, all of which look very similar but have different voices and ranges. Duida Woodcreeper is known from eastern Ecuador, northeastern Peru, northwestern Brazil, eastern Venezuela, and near the southern and eastern borders of Colombia. Song is a series of whistles that decreases in pitch and accelerates near the end. Inhabits canopy of lowland and foothill rainforest, and often joins mixed-species flocks."
0,Dulit Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus harterti,https://ebird.org/species/dulfro1,"Large frogmouth of Borneo’s central mountains. Inhabits foothill forest (typically 600–1230 m). Heavyset, with a whiskered face and bright white spots on the wings. Similar Large Frogmouth is generally found at lower elevations; Dulit has broader (as opposed to Large’s sharply triangular) white wing spots, strong pale barring on the throat, and overall darker coloration. Song is a low, resonant, melancholy-sounding “hooooo’m”; call consists of barks, typically given in pairs: “woo’WUP!”."
0,Dune Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Calendulauda erythrochlamys,https://ebird.org/species/dunlar3,"A medium-sized lark that has a rounded head lacking a crest, a slightly decurved bill, a plain face pattern, and diffuse pale streaking that is restricted to the breast. Upperparts coloration is mostly pale sandy-pink to buff, often matching the prevailing soil color in the region. Pairs are restricted to the sand dunes of the Namib desert, where this species is often one of the few birds present. The male sings from dunes, and in spring it performs an aerial flight display 10-30 meters above the ground, with deep wingbeats, fluttering, and dangling legs. The song is a distinctive rolling set of dry raspy introductory clicks, followed by whistles and trills. The Dune Lark’s range abuts with the range of the similar but larger Barlow’s Lark, which is more richly colored and has bold brown breast streaks."
0,Dunlin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris alpina,https://ebird.org/species/dunlin,"Small, plump shorebird with droopy bill. Breeding plumage is distinctive with rufous or brown back and black belly. In fall and winter, plain grayish-brown above with white belly. Often in large flocks on mudflats and beaches, sometimes mixing with other shorebirds. Breeds on Arctic tundra; winters on coastlines throughout the Northern Hemisphere; typically less common inland. A late migrant, especially in fall; lingers longer at higher latitudes than most other small shorebirds. Very similar to Curlew Sandpiper in nonbreeding plumage, but Dunlin is more compact, shorter-winged and shorter-legged, and darker. Droopy bill might recall Western Sandpiper, but Dunlin is larger and darker. Also compare with Purple Sandpiper, which is even darker and more spotted and has orange legs. Listen for loud, slightly buzzy “dzeer!” calls."
0,Dunn's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Eremalauda dunni,https://ebird.org/species/dunlar1,"A chunky, large-billed lark of desolate sandy deserts and open arid plains in northern Africa. Plain sandy-brown above and paler below, with faint and indistinct white markings on the face. Also note the pinkish bill and the inky black outer tail feathers, most apparent in flight. Runs about on the ground, stopping abruptly. Found singly or in pairs when breeding, gathering in larger groups only during the non-breeding season. The song is a sequence of whistles and dry notes, given both from the ground and in song flight. Generally similar to other dry-country larks such as Desert Lark, Bar-tailed Lark, and Kordofan Lark, but combination of unmarked upperparts, black outer tail feathers, and the uniformly pink and bulbous bill is diagnostic."
0,Dunnock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Prunellidae,Prunella modularis,https://ebird.org/species/dunnoc1,"Fairly common to common but unobtrusive, found in a variety of open scrubby and wooded habitats, from low bleak heathland to parks, gardens, and farmland with hedges. Usually seen as singles or pairs, hopping on lawns or paths with distinctive shuffling gait. Appearance rather drab but distinctive: note slender, thrush-like bill (not stout, like superficially similar sparrows), blue-gray head sides, streaked back. Undistinguished, slightly tinny, rambling song has an even, warbled cadence; distinctive when learned."
0,Dupont's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Chersophilus duponti,https://ebird.org/species/duplar1,"The same size as Eurasian Skylark, with a longer and more slender down-curved bill and small head. Cryptically-plumaged upperparts with pale feather edges, a heavily streaked breast, and a white belly. North African race paler still than Iberian birds. Found in natural steppes and semi-deserts, walking with its head up, looking tall. Fiendishly hard to see. Prefers to run when disturbed rather than fly. Melancholic song delivered high in the sky at dusk and dawn."
0,Dusky Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacroides tyrannina,https://ebird.org/species/dusant1,"This skulking species lives in humid tropical lowlands, favoring thickets and tangles at forest edges and along streams. Often heard song of piping whistles usually reveals the presence of Dusky Antbirds, which usually occur in pairs but are difficult to see clearly. Male is slaty gray overall with narrow whitish wingbars. Female has a rusty “blank” face and rusty underparts."
0,Dusky Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides tenebrosa,https://ebird.org/species/dusbab2,"A very dark babbler with a pale eye. Found very locally in areas of moist woodland with thick undergrowth, almost always in small groups that feed by hopping across the ground. Much more elusive and skulking than most babblers. Similar to Black-lored Babbler, but Dusky Babbler is much darker, and there is virtually no overlap in range. Usually located by the raspy babbling call, typically given by a whole group in chorus."
0,Dusky Broadbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Eurylaimidae,Corydon sumatranus,https://ebird.org/species/dusbro1,"Strange-looking bird with predominantly dark plumage, a pale “bib,” and an enormous, deep-set pink bill. Its long body and bulky build makes it seem more like an aberrant roller than a large broadbill. Forages like a roller, frequently making forays from a perch, but much more social, often being encountered in noisy medium-sized groups. Found in forests from lowlands up into the highlands, typically in wetter areas. Gives many different calls, including an ascending series of squeaky notes, as well as mellow single notes and less pleasant-sounding croaks and rattles."
0,Dusky Crag-Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Ptyonoprogne concolor,https://ebird.org/species/duscrm1,"An overall dark brown swallow with paler underparts. It has a square tail with a white spot on each tail feather, making a white speckled band of sorts. Young birds have paler underparts. Mostly seen flying in pairs or small flocks along cliffs, but sometimes also near tall buildings. Flight action generally slower than Barn Swallow’s, but can wheel and loop at quick speed."
0,Dusky Crested-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Stenostiridae,Elminia nigromitrata,https://ebird.org/species/ducfly1,"A slim, dark member of the fairy flycatcher family with a blackish head, a slight crest, and slate-gray underparts. Found in the understory of rainforest at low and middle elevations. Perky and active; never seems to stop moving. Frequently joins mixed-species flocks. Similar to White-bellied Crested-Flycatcher, but generally found at lower elevations, and has a dark belly. Also similar to White-tailed Crested-Flycatcher, but smaller, with a dark belly and tail. Reminiscent of Blue-headed Crested-Flycatcher, but smaller, and the underparts don’t show a sharp divide between a dark breast and a paler belly."
0,Dusky Crimsonwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Cryptospiza jacksoni,https://ebird.org/species/ducwin1,"Small, dark member of the waxbill family. The back and face are red, the wings and tail black, and the underparts dark gray. Males and females are similar, though males have more red on the face. Immatures lack red on the face. Found in Albertine Rift montane forest, including forest edge and glades. Inconspicuous bird that is usually found in pairs or small groups. The call is a high-pitched “tsit.” Similar in size and overall coloration to Dusky Twinspot, but shows red on the face and none on the flanks."
0,Dusky Friarbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Philemon fuscicapillus,https://ebird.org/species/dusfri1,"A large gray-brown honeyeater with a long, powerful dagger-shaped bill and pink bare skin around the eye. Paler on the underparts. Singles or pairs inhabit canopy of forest, forest edge, and plantations in the lowlands. Similar to the entirely brown Halmahera Oriole by the bare skin around the eye. Bill shape also different, with a sharper, finer point to the bill on the friarbird. Gives a fluty, oriole-like song with repetitive “chewit-woow” phrases. Also gives a harsh “ker” alarm note."
0,Dusky Fulvetta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pellorneidae,Schoeniparus brunneus,https://ebird.org/species/dusful1,"A small dark brown bird of the shaded understory and forest floor, found hilly forests. Brown overall; gray face is marked with a thin, curving black eyebrow and a weaker black moustachial stripe, though these marks are often hard to discern in the darkness of the thick growth in which it likes to forage. Song is a short but melodic warble; various calls, including a low churring note and a quick “whee-chuck.”"
0,Dusky Gerygone,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Gerygone tenebrosa,https://ebird.org/species/dusger1,"Small bird with thin bill (longer than on most other gerygones), found only in dense mangroves along the northwestern Australian coast. Grayish brown above, off-white below, with pale eye. Juvenile has brownish eye. Similar Mangrove Gerygone has red eye, smaller bill, and white patches in tail; Large-billed Gerygone has dark eye and heavier bill. Unlikely to be seen outside mangrove habitat."
0,Dusky Grasswren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Amytornis purnelli,https://ebird.org/species/dusgra1,"Small rusty-brown bird with finely streaked plumage and long cocked tail, found in rocky areas and gorges around spinifex clumps of Central Australia, including Alice Springs and Tennant Creek. Upperparts rusty brown, underparts slightly paler brown, the adult female showing a small rusty flank patch. Usually seen on the ground, scrambling around rocks and spinifex clumps. Much more solidly built than fairywrens, and with fine white streaks on head and chest."
0,Dusky Grouse,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Dendragapus obscurus,https://ebird.org/species/dusgro,"Large, dark chickenlike bird found in wooded habitats, usually with conifers and shrubby undergrowth. Typically seen on the ground; easiest to see in mid-summer when females and chicks frequent roadsides and trails. When male displays, ruffles neck feathers to reveal wrinkled purple-red skin and makes deep hooting noise. Female browner and more intricately patterned. Note large size and relatively long tail. Feeds on plant matter, especially conifer needles. Separate from Sooty Grouse by range."
0,Dusky Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Phaeoptila sordida,https://ebird.org/species/dushum1,"Rather drab, “female-plumaged,” medium-size hummingbird of arid scrubby habitats, including gardens and open woodlands. Feeds at all levels and usually wags and fans tail persistently while hovering—a good field character. Both sexes are dull bronzy green above and dingy, pale grayish below. Male has more extensive red on the bill and female has small whitish tail corners. Female Broad-billed Hummingbird similar, but brighter green above with very little range overlap."
0,Dusky Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Pinarocorys nigricans,https://ebird.org/species/duslar1,"A robust, elongated thrush-like lark with dark, lightly scaled upperparts, heavily streaked pale underparts, and a boldly marked face. Pairs breed (July-October) in open broadleaf woodland, often in recently burned areas. Small post-breeding flocks disperse south and occupy suitable habitat in an unpredictable manner, sometimes irrupting. Pairs or loose flocks walk on the ground foraging for insects and seeds, flicking their wings. The Groundscraper Thrush differs by being larger and having a plain (not scaled) back."
0,Dusky Lory,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Pseudeos fuscata,https://ebird.org/species/duslor1,"Fairly large lory of lowlands and foothill forest and edge. Mainly dark plumage, with 2 obvious bands across the chest and a red bill. Coloration varies from yellow to red. In flight, bright yellow patch in the wing is highly visible. Distinctive fast and straight flight. Often seen flying high in large flocks. Somewhat similar to Black, Brown and Yellow-streaked Lories, but Dusky has a red rather than black bill and different flight. Coconut Lorikeet shows bright red in the fore wing. Very vocal. Noisy, high-pitch, ringing screeches."
0,Dusky Moorhen,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallinula tenebrosa,https://ebird.org/species/dusmoo1,"Dark waterhen with white edges to the under tail. Bill and forehead shield are primarily red with a yellow tip. Juvenile and non-breeding adult may be confused with other species due to their less colorful bills, which may appear primarily dark. Occurs in a wide variety of wetland habitats and is a common sight in urban parks. Typically fairly vocal, produces a wide array of shrieking sounds."
0,Dusky Munia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lonchura fuscans,https://ebird.org/species/dusmun1,"Entirely dark brown munia; widespread across Borneo’s lowlands and lower-elevation foothills. Frequently encountered in grassland, scrubby or weedy forest edge, and agricultural areas, particularly rice fields. Adult has a bright silver-gray bill and is darkest on the face and throat. Juvenile paler and more mottled, with a dark bill. Often calls while in flight; gives a tittering “chir-r-r-rip!”, as well as high, plaintive peeps and quiet “pip”s and “tsip”s."
0,Dusky Myzomela,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Myzomela obscura,https://ebird.org/species/dusmyz1,"Small, entirely dark sooty-brown honeyeater. Very plain and lacking any colorful distinctive features. Take care to separate from Brown Honeyeater (which is much paler, has yellow on the wings and a triangular patch behind the eye), female Scarlet Myzomela (which is smaller, paler, and has a longer bill), and White-gaped Honeyeater (which has a white patch near the bill). Found in New Guinea and northern and eastern Australia. Typically lives in coastal habitats, including parks and gardens, where vegetation is not sparse."
0,Dusky Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Antrostomus saturatus,https://ebird.org/species/dusnig1,"Small dark nightjar with very limited range in the highlands of Costa Rica and Panama. Few obvious plumage features: entire body is intricately patterned with dark brown, black, and buff. Pale corners to tail (white in male, buffy in female). Fairly common above around 1,500 m, where it can be found at the edge of cloud forest. Usually perches on a fence post or low branch. Strictly nocturnal, and easily detected by voice; listen for the trilled “whip, wee-per-wee!,” rising at the end. Closely related to whip-poor-wills further north."
0,Dusky Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Pionus fuscus,https://ebird.org/species/duspar1,"Medium-sized, stocky rainforest parrot. Can appear mostly black even at fairly close range. Tends to occur as single birds or pairs rather than large groups. Flight style distinctive; birds appear to keep wings below the horizontal, rolling from side to side. Usually first detected flying overhead; descends rapidly and silently into forests to feed on fruit and flowers in the canopy. In flight, confusion is possible with Blue-headed Parrot, but Dusky has different flight style with shallower wingbeats and different calls."
0,Dusky Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Patagioenas goodsoni,https://ebird.org/species/duspig2,"This pigeon is found in the Choco region of western Colombia and Ecuador. It is fairly dull grayish-brown overall, especially gray on the head and breast with a warmer reddish tone on the nape. Compare with Ruddy Pigeon, which is typically brighter reddish on the head and breast. Most easily distinguished by voice. Dusky sings a three-note song, with a higher, longer first note followed by two shorter clipped notes: “WHOOO, whoop, whoop!” Also gives a growling call similar to other pigeons. Occurs in lowlands and foothills up to around 1,500 m. Can be fairly common, especially by voice, but sometimes is difficult to spot in the canopy."
0,Dusky Piha,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Lipaugus fuscocinereus,https://ebird.org/species/duspih1,"This large, relatively long-tailed cotinga is completely lacking in distinctive plumage: it is entirely plain gray. Sexes alike. Found from around 2,000–3,000 m, far above the elevation range of any similar cotingas. Could be confused with Great Thrush, which is a similar size and color, but note dark legs and bill. Also focus on the Piha’s shape, with its long tail, short bill, and round head. Occurs in humid cloud forest, where it typically perches inconspicuously in the middle to upper levels of forest. Often found around fruiting trees."
0,Dusky Purpletuft,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Iodopleura fusca,https://ebird.org/species/duspur1,"Small, uncommon cotinga; usually seen perched in the uppermost bare branches of a high tree. At a distance, appears mostly black with a conspicuous white line down center of breast. Poorly known; found in tall rainforest and lower-stature forests on white sand where it is often seen in pairs or small groups. Feeds on fruit. Size, shape, and habit of perching in bare treetops recall the much more common Swallow-winged Puffbird, which lacks purpletuft’s white breast stripe. Calls are soft, indistinct whistles."
0,Dusky Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Melanodryas vittata,https://ebird.org/species/dusrob1,"Medium-sized, rather long-tailed Australian robin, both sexes plain brown overall. Darker than similar species and lacking any pale wing panels. Often perches on a rock or stump, from which it pounces on prey on the ground. Endemic to Tasmania, where inhabits open forests, gardens, and coastal heathland."
0,Dusky Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Synallaxis moesta,https://ebird.org/species/dusspi1,"An exceptionally shy spinetail found in cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes, ranging into lowland forest in some areas. Plumage is dark gray with a black throat and chestnut crown, wings, and tail. In central Colombia, birds are somewhat paler. Inhabits dense tangles in forest understory, where it is very hard to see. Usually first detected by its song, a low, guttural trill."
0,Dusky Starfrontlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Coeligena orina,https://ebird.org/species/dussta1,"Rare hummingbird known only from a few locations in the northern half of Colombia’s western Andes. Large and long billed with iridescent green belly and rump. Male has glittering green forehead and sapphire throat patch. Female lacks these features and instead has a buffy throat and mustache. Inhabits humid forest at high elevations up to tree line. Feeds on a variety of flowers, and regularly visits feeders in the reserve that bears its Spanish name, the Colibrí del Sol Nature Reserve above the town of Urrao."
0,Dusky Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris fuscus,https://ebird.org/species/dussun2,"A small sunbird. The male is dark overall, with a pale lower belly and orange tufts at the shoulder that are sometimes hidden. The female is plain gray-brown with a paler lower belly. Singles and pairs prefer arid scrub and savanna, feeding on insects and nectar. The species is nomadic and can irrupt in large numbers into areas where it is normally irregular, often on the fringes of its range. The female Dusky Sunbird has paler underparts than the similar female Southern Double-collared Sunbird."
0,Dusky Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus fuscus,https://ebird.org/species/dustap1,"Often heard but rarely seen; a retiring little gray bird of bamboo thickets and other dense shrubbery at forest edges, along streams, and in wooded patches, mainly in drier areas. Can move very quickly through bamboo like a mouse. Plumage is slaty gray overall, sometimes with paler barring, but overall plainer than Magellanic Tapaculo without silvery-white head spots. Best identified by voice. Also compare with Ochre-flanked Tapaculo, which has limited range overlap."
0,Dusky Tetraka,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Bernieridae,Xanthomixis tenebrosa,https://ebird.org/species/dustet1,"Extremely rare and enigmatic tetraka. Dark olive-green overall, with a pale yellowish throat and ring around the eye. Chunky and short-tailed. Madagascar endemic that is known from a handful of sites in the northeastern rainforest at middle and low elevations. Inhabits the ground and understory and acts much like Yellow-browed Oxylabes, but lacks that species’ bold eyebrow. Shorter-tailed than Spectacled Tetraka, with a duller eye-ring. Call is a very high, thin “seet” given singly or in a quick series."
0,Dusky Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus eunomus,https://ebird.org/species/dusthr2,"This heavily marked thrush is easily identified when seen well. Females average duller than males, but both sexes have a dark cheek on an overall white face, brown upperparts (strongly rufous-tinted in males), bright rufous wings, and dark underparts densely marked with white chevrons. Much darker than scarce Naumann's Thrush, with which it may associate and sometimes hybridizes. Very vocal, delivering loud chattering notes in both songs and calls. Breeds in taiga, tundra, and steppelands; winters in forests, as well as open habitat such as forest edges and fields."
0,Dusky Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Melaniparus funereus,https://ebird.org/species/dustit2,"Unusual forest tit that is all dark with a red eye. The male is mostly black, and the female dark gray. Found in humid forest, often around clearings or along the edge. Usually in pairs or small groups, readily joining mixed-species flocks. Gives a wide variety of vocalizations including a raspy up-and-down series, a typical tit “dree di-di-di,” and other whistled and scolding notes. Active tit behavior, small size, and small bill separate this species from other dark forest birds."
0,Dusky Turtle-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Streptopelia lugens,https://ebird.org/species/dutdov1,"Very dark dove with a black mark on the neck. When seen well, shows beautiful rufous edges to the wing feathers. Slightly paler gray corners to the tail are evident in flight. Found at middle and high elevations in a wide variety of habitats, including forest edge, woodland, gardens, and cultivation. The call is a quiet series of descending growl notes. Somewhat like Red-eyed Dove, but smaller and much darker overall, without a contrastingly paler head."
0,Dusky Twinspot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Euschistospiza cinereovinacea,https://ebird.org/species/dustwi1,"Unusual, very dark twinspot with small and faint “twin spots” on the belly. The red rump is conspicuous in flight. Found in grassy areas along forest edge and in lush cultivation. Not very vocal, but gives quiet twitters and a “tsip” call.

Cheek stripes and lack of bare skin at base of bill help distinguish this species from Snares and Erect-crested Penguins."
0,Firethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope pectardens,https://ebird.org/species/fireth1,"Male is stunning, with a metallic blue back, a black mask extending down to the shoulder, and a burning flame-orange throat and breast. Female is plain brown and very difficult to distinguish from female Indian Blue Robin (which generally breeds at lower altitudes than Firethroat) and Siberian Blue Robin (which overlaps with Firethroat only on migration); look out for the female Firethroat’s relatively brighter white throat, darker underparts, and lack of scaling on the breast. The species is shy, keeping to the undergrowth, but will emerge into the open to sing; song is repetitive and pleasant, with imitations and deeper notes thrown in. Breeds in dense, low montane vegetation; winters in similar habitat in lower foothills."
0,Fiscal Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis silens,https://ebird.org/species/fisfly1,"A large pied flycatcher that is most commonly mistaken for Southern Fiscal. However, the upright stance and slender unhooked bill are distinctive flycatcher traits, and the pattern of white in the flight feathers and basal windows of the tail is diagnostic. The female is duller than the male. Singles and pairs frequent a variety of open country habitats, including gardens, parks, shrubland, and woodland, where they perch conspicuously and hawk insect prey from the ground or aerially. The species is mostly silent but occasionally it utters a thin high-pitched song. The similar Southern Fiscal is more robust than the Fiscal Flycatcher, with a chunky hook-tipped bill, a white V-pattern on the shoulders, and a long tail with white outer feathers."

Note the ornate markings on the head: a moderate crest that is white-and-orange along the back, and white stripes above and below the eye. Like all turacos, shows large crimson wing patches in flight. Found in coastal forest and woodland and along forest edge. Acts like a typical turaco, bouncing through the trees and flying occasionally with short bursts of wingbeats and long glides. Overall similar to Livingstone’s and Hartlaub’s Turacos, but easily separated by the orange in the crest. Call is a gruff, accelerating series of “kow” notes."
0,Fish Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus ossifragus,https://ebird.org/species/fiscro,"A relatively small, glossy crow. Very difficult to separate from American Crow by appearance; look for Fish Crow’s slightly more tapered wings, quicker wingbeats, and shorter legs.

Pairs prefer grassy savanna and open woodland, where they forage for insects by running furtively between clumps of grass and shrubs. The male gives a distinctive aerial display that involves the mechanical “clapping” of the wings beneath the body. He rises to 50-100 meters in the air and slowly circles his territory, giving a series of short (one-second) bursts of wing-clapping, typically rendered “prrrrrt, prrrrrt, prrrrt….” The may be accompanied by a simple canary-like song “cheeroo-weee.” The similar Rufous-naped Lark is larger, with a completely different display."
0,Flavescent Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus flavescens,https://ebird.org/species/flabul1,"Brownish-yellow bulbul with a faint white eyebrow and a weakly tufted crest. Roams about in pairs or small groups, sometimes associating with other species. Prefers open forest and edge habitat over dense mature forests. Often found in scrubbier, less pristine habitats than other bulbuls in its range, though tends not to occur in cities as readily as Red-vented and Red-whiskered Bulbuls; a regular visitor of rural gardens and farm edges. Simple song consists of alternating sharp whistles, warbled notes, and buzzy gurgling. Also gives harsh low buzzing calls."
0,Flavescent Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiophobus flavicans,https://ebird.org/species/flafly2,"A relatively drab olive-yellow flycatcher with indistinct tawny wingbars (sometimes nearly lacking) and yellowish spectacles. Fairly common in Andean cloud forest from Venezuela to Peru. Singles or pairs found in the lower levels of forest, sometimes (but not always) with mixed-species flocks. Occurs from around 1,200–2,700 m. Compare with Orange-crested Flycatcher, which has a thin complete eyering."
0,Flavescent Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Myiothlypis flaveola,https://ebird.org/species/flawar1,"Yellowish warbler found in deciduous dry forests and gallery forests where it forages hyperactively on the ground.

0,Flightless Cormorant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Nannopterum harrisi,https://ebird.org/species/flicor1,"Brown, aquatic bird with brilliant blue eyes. Tiny, stunted wings look almost comical and seem out-of-place on such a large bird. Endemic to Galápagos (where it is the only cormorant), and restricted to rocky coastlines of Isabela and Fernandina islands. Breeds throughout the year in small colonies. Often seen carrying large clumps of seaweed, which it uses to build its nest."
0,Flock Bronzewing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Phaps histrionica,https://ebird.org/species/flobro1,"Large desert pigeon, typically observed as fast-flying flocks coming in to drink in the morning or evening in arid and semi-arid inland Northern Australia. Plain brown above, plain gray below. Male has black-and-white patterned head, in female and juvenile a more muted brown-and-white pattern. Upperwings plain brown, with plain gray outer wing; similar Common Bronzewing has a metallic wing panel."
0,Floreana Mockingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus trifasciatus,https://ebird.org/species/chamoc1,"A fairly large gray-and-white songbird with a long tail, curved bill, and black blotches on sides of breast. Endemic to Galápagos. Now found only on two tiny islets (Gardner and Campeón) off the coast of Floreana Island, it is the only species of mockingbird in its range. Tourists are not allowed to land on these islets, so the birds are usually seen from a boat while they are perched up on cacti or small trees."
0,Flores Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus florensis,https://ebird.org/species/flocro1,"An entirely black crow confined to the island of Flores. Found in small, vocal parties within forest in lowlands and hills. Overlaps with Large-billed Crow, and similarly large-billed, but Flores Crow is smaller-bodied with a relatively smaller bill, and lacks the pronounced steep forehead characteristic of Large-billed Crow. Flores Crow is also a forest species, avoiding open habitats, and has a distinctive voice. Vocalizations are odd for a crow, including babylike, whining, high-pitched “waa” and “we-we-we” calls, the latter sometimes followed by a deep “kyop.” Also gives high “kraaa” notes, a throaty, disyllabic “kwiyou,” and other gurgling sounds."
0,Flores Green-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Treron floris,https://ebird.org/species/flgpig1,"A small, largely green pigeon with bold, scattered pale markings on its wings. Adults show largely pale bills while immatures have dark bills. Small groups found in varied habitats with trees, from forests to open woodlands. In most of its range it is the only Treron green-pigeon, but where it overlaps with Pink-necked Green-Pigeon, note the extensive pale markings on the wing of Flores Green-Pigeon and the absence of a pink-orange breast patch. Song is a series of soft whistles, “woo-wo-OW,” rising at end. Also gives harsher guttural notes."
0,Flores Monarch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Symposiachrus sacerdotum,https://ebird.org/species/flomon1,"A small gray-and white songbird with a black mask and chin and a bright white undertail. Upperparts slate-gray and underparts clean white. Very local, restricted to the island of Flores. Found singly or in pairs in the understory of forested hills, where it often joins mixed-species flocks. Lack of peach wash on the breast separates it from Spectacled Monarch. Song is a series of repeated “weee-weee-weee-weee” notes, with a rise in pitch near the end. Also gives scratchy “churr” notes."
0,Flores Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus alfredi,https://ebird.org/species/flsowl1,"A small owl with yellow eyes, a pale bill, an unmarked rufous face and ear tufts, a pale forehead, mainly rufous upperparts with prominent white spots in the wings, and a faintly-scaled pale grayish underside. Juvenile is largely pale rufous, with little barring but strong tail bands. Inhabits montane forest on Flores. Distinguished from larger Wallace’s and Moluccan Scops-Owls by rufous appearance, pale bill, lack of prominent dark facial border, and absence of bold streaking on underparts. Song is a distinctive crake-like, stuttering “da-da-da-da-da-da-da,” wavering in pitch."
0,Florida Scrub-Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma coerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/flsjay,"Bold, blue-and-gray jay of oak scrub in central Florida. Juveniles have browner head and back than adults. Lacks crest and patterning on the wings and tail seen on Blue Jay. Very social, staying in close family groups to raise young. Readily hops on the ground while searching for food. Unique scrubby habitat must burn periodically in order to remain appropriate for Florida Scrub-Jays. Classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act."
0,Flutist Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Microcerculus ustulatus,https://ebird.org/species/fluwre1,"Tiny, mouse-like bird of tepui forest understory. Entirely dark rufous-brown with a stubby tail. Found only in humid, mossy forest on tepui slopes, mostly above 1000 meters, where it is difficult to see, staying close to the ground as it crawls over roots, rocks, and large branches. Usually encountered alone and does not follow mixed-species flocks. Most easily detected by its extraordinary song: a variable series of short, pure whistles, rising and falling but usually ending with several notes on the same pitch; humanlike and easily imitated. May pop into view in response to imitation or playback, bobbing nervously before disappearing. Could be confused with Tepui Wren, but is darker brown overall and lacks buffy eyebrow."
0,Fluttering Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus gavia,https://ebird.org/species/flushe1,"A small dark-brown shearwater with a white belly and a dusky patch under its wings along with dark markings on the inner wing visible during flight. A brown cap expands over the eye and runs down the back of the neck, blurring into the white chin and breast. Name is derived from distinctive low and fast “fluttering” flight with rapid bursts of wingbeats. Often seen feeding in flocks off the northern and eastern North Island and in the Cook Strait region. Easily confused with Hutton’s Shearwater where habitats overlap on the Cook Strait. Hutton’s is slightly larger with little white showing on the chin and more extensive gray armpit smudging. Little Shearwater also occurs in northern waters but is smaller, with white extending through or above the eye."
0,Fly River Grassbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Poodytes albolimbatus,https://ebird.org/species/flrgra1,"A fairly small bird of marshes in the Trans-Fly of New Guinea. Best seen by boat. Rufous crown, rump and upper tail, whitish underparts with buffy flanks, heavily streaked orange-brown back and black wing feathers edged with white. Inquisitive and often keeps its tail cocked and wings drooped. Similar to Tawny and Little Grassbirds, but Fly River has an unstreaked, rufous crown, and is smaller than Tawny. Voice, a monotone whistle and a harsh “chat!”."
0,Flying Steamer-Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Tachyeres patachonicus,https://ebird.org/species/flystd1,"A large, heavily built duck that is fairly common along rocky seacoasts and on lakes near the coast; also local and uncommon on larger lakes farther inland. Despite the name, rarely seen in flight; more often seen thrashing through the water like an old paddle steamer boat, hence the name. Male’s bill is mostly orange, while the female’s bill is mostly greenish. Plumage of both sexes is duller gray or brownish gray compared to Flightless Steamer-Duck; the two species sometimes occur together, but Flightless tends to be warier."
0,Foothill Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis olallai,https://ebird.org/species/fooela1,"Inconspicuous flycatcher of Andean cloud forest. Plumage varies geographically but always has a gray head, olive back, and yellow spots on wings that may or may not form distinct wingbars. Underparts are bright yellow in most of its range. In northern and central Colombia, it has a pale gray throat and breast and a yellow belly. Usually found at middle levels of the forest, often with mixed-species flocks. Vocalizations include a series of downslurred notes and a rapid trill."
0,Foothill Schiffornis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Schiffornis aenea,https://ebird.org/species/thlsch8,"Very plain bird of cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes in Ecuador, northern Peru, and far southern Colombia. It usually looks dull brown and featureless, though it may show an olive tinge and paler chin if seen in bright light. Sexes look alike. It is one of several species that together were formerly known as Thrush-like Schiffornis; they differ in range, voice, and elevation. Often best identified by its frequently given song: a wavering whistle that seems out of tune, rising and falling in pitch several times. Stays in the forest understory, and often perches motionless for long periods."
0,Foothill Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/foosco1,"Small, cryptically patterned, yellow-eyed owl of forest in lowlands and foothills, where it tends to stay well hidden in the understory. Occurs on the east slope of the Andes and into the lowlands, as far south as Bolivia and as far east as the Guyanas. Cannot be identified readily by sight, but it is the only screech-owl throughout most of its range and within its habitat. Song is a purring trill that can easily be mistaken for the purring of a toad or insect. Plumage varies from grayish brown overall to reddish."
0,Foothill Stipplethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Epinecrophylla spodionota,https://ebird.org/species/fooant1,"Small antwren of dense foothill forests. Male is grayish with the black speckled throat that gives this group of antwrens their name. Note also the bold whitish wingbars, and brown flanks, rump, and tail. Females are entirely tan with bold wingbars. Forages in the understory of mature forest, often in mixed-species flocks. Song is a rising-falling series of high pitched notes."
0,Forbes's Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Anumara forbesi,https://ebird.org/species/forbla1,"Medium-sized, slim blackbird with uniform matte black plumage. Note the long straight bill with a straight upper mandible. Has a very small, but disjunct, distribution; occurs at the forest edge near marshes and even in sugarcane plantations.

0,Forbes's Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius forbesi,https://ebird.org/species/forplo1,"Pretty plover that is found in both wet and dry habitats. Note the black cap, gray forehead, white stripe behind the eye, and two black bands across the breast. In flight, shows a small amount of white on the trailing edge of the wings and the corners of the tail. Found in a variety of open habitats, such as short grassland (including recently burned areas), cultivation, and muddy wetland edges. At least partially migratory. The call is a plaintive “treeow” which is sometimes given in a rolling series. Very similar to Three-banded Plover, but separated by the dark gray rather than pale forehead, and by the thicker lower breast band."
0,Forest Bittern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Zonerodius heliosylus,https://ebird.org/species/forbit1,"A large, shy bird of forest streams in the lowlands and foothills. Strong barring apart from white belly. Note the dagger-shaped bill with a broad base, striking yellow eyes and yellow legs. Solitary and feeds on small fish and crustaceans in streams. Flies up and perches in trees when flushed. Similar to the juvenile Rufous Night-Heron but found in more forested environments and has barring rather than streaks and spots. Normally silent."
0,Forest Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo trizonatus,https://ebird.org/species/moubuz3,"A resident, brownish buzzard of forest, forest edge, and adjacent open areas. The breast is heavily blotched with brown, and there is often a paler “U”-shaped patch on the lower breast. It calls a plaintive mewing “keeaaar”. The similar Common Buzzard is variable but it often has a more uniformly brown (less blotchy) chest than Forest Buzzard, it tends to have a rusty (not dark) tail, and it is a migrant that is present within the range of Forest Buzzard (in more open habitats) mostly between September and April."
0,Forest Canary,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra scotops,https://ebird.org/species/forcan1,"A very streaky yellow-green canary with a chunky pale pinkish bill. The male has a blackish face and chin and a yellow eyebrow. The female is grayer on the face. Pairs and small groups frequent forest edges, thickets, gardens, and the edges of cultivation. The jumbled song and call are high-pitched and varied. Similar looking citrils occur farther north in Africa."
0,Forest Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis gaimardii,https://ebird.org/species/forela1,"This nondescript flycatcher is most often detected by its call, a piercing two-parted “pee-sweet!” Visually it’s not overwhelming: yellowish underparts, olive upperparts, pale yellowish wingbars, and a gray head with a vague white eyebrow and black eyeline. Fairly small and similar to other species of elaenia and flycatchers; voice is most useful feature for identification. Usually seen singly in the canopy of lowland forest, often following mixed-species flocks. Widespread from Panama to Brazil."
0,Forest Fody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia omissa,https://ebird.org/species/forfod1,"Sparrow-like weaver in which red-hooded breeding males are distinctive, but females and non-breeding females are drab. Madagascar endemic that is found in and adjacent to rainforest, sometimes in flocks that may include other birds. Calls are high, silvery notes, given in long series as a song. Can be very similar to Red Fody. Breeding male Forest Fody lacks red on the back and belly, though molting male Red Fody can match this pattern. Females and non-breeding males very similar, but Forest Fody is darker and more greenish, with a larger bill. Hybrids are also common and further confuse identification. Unlike Red Fody, found in the rainforest interior."
0,Forest Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Microptilotis montanus,https://ebird.org/species/forhon1,"A rare, medium-sized honeyeater of foothill forest in northern New Guinea. Fairly uniform, brown plumage with a white ear spot and light mottling below. Forages singly for insects and doesn’t really visit flowering trees. The only other similar species with a white ear spot is Scrub honeyeater which is found more in scrub than forest and is green with an orange gape. Call, an upslurred “weep” is diagnostic."

Found in lowland rainforest, secondary forest, and sometimes plantations, usually in the canopy. Uncommon and inconspicuous, in pairs or small flocks. Similar to Yellow Penduline-Tit, but much duller and found in different habitat. Could be confused with Tit-Hylia, but duller overall, without streaking on the head and breast. Could also be confused with some dull sunbirds, but has a shorter, deeper-based, and sharper bill. The vocalizations are very high-pitched “sit” notes that are easily missed."
0,Forest Raven,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus tasmanicus,https://ebird.org/species/forrav1,"Australian crows and ravens are challenging to identify; concentrate on call, throat-hackles, behavior, and location. Calls slow and deep. Very heavy bill, with visible throat hackles. Does not flicks wings when calling. Inhabits Tasmania (where the only resident crow/raven) and coastal southeastern Australia, with an isolated subspecies in northern New South Wales, where it should be identified with extreme care."
0,Forest Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cercotrichas leucosticta,https://ebird.org/species/fosrob1,"A variable buff-brown scrub-robin with bold white on the tail tip, eyebrow, throat, and wing. Underparts are warm brown and rump is rufous. A secretive resident, found in pairs in primary lowland evergreen forest and thickets, entering farmbush and other secondary habitats, and scarp forest up to 1600 meters. It is often first detected by its varied up-and-down musical song “teee-tooo-tree-too-loo-dee-doo” and other similar delightful tunes. The similar Brown-backed Scrub-Robin differs from Forest Scrub-Robin by having a diffusely streaked breast and a rufous basal half of the tail."
0,Forest Rock-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Monticola sharpei,https://ebird.org/species/forrot2,"Chunky, mid-sized robin-like bird.

0,Frances's Sparrowhawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter francesiae,https://ebird.org/species/fragos2,"Typical small sparrowhawk with a gray or brown back and pale underparts. Females are much larger than males and show reddish barring below. Smaller male is pale-chested. Found in open forest, scrub, plantations, and even villages. Usually seen sitting on an open perch or dashing through the trees; rarely soars. Small, pale male is distinctive, but female and brownish immature very hard to separate from some Madagascar Sparrowhawks. On Frances’s Sparrowhawk, look for fine bars on the undertail, reddish chest barring, a single dark stripe down the center of the throat, and a short central toe."
0,Franklin's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Leucophaeus pipixcan,https://ebird.org/species/fragul,"Medium-sized gull with medium-gray upperparts. Breeding plumage shows black head with thick white eye arcs, large white spots on black wingtips, and deep red bill and legs. White underparts are often tinged with pink. Nonbreeding plumage has partial black hood and dark bill and legs. Juveniles have browner upperparts. Breeds around lakes and marshes in the prairies of north-central North America.

0,Friedmann's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra pulpa,https://ebird.org/species/frilar1,"A small, compact lark with dark brown upperparts that appear scaly in fresh plumage, a streaked crown that can be raised as a crest, an indistinct tawny eyebrow, a striking pale throat, and a pale belly with dark breast streaks. The bill is bicolored: pale below with a dark ridge on the upper mandible. The tail is mostly dark with white outer feathers that are conspicuous in flight. Movements of this very localized lark are poorly known, but small groups are probably partial migrants and nomads in dense grassland with scattered bush; likely often goes undetected when not singing. Best identification feature is the diagnostic song, a single-note strident loud up-and-down “wheeeeoooo” whistle, repeated incessantly every two seconds for minutes at a time."
0,Friendly Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella accentor,https://ebird.org/species/frbwar1,"Though frequently derided for the reputed inaccuracy of its name, this mouse-like bird can prove quite confiding. It is, however, generally quite difficult to see in dense undergrowth; best detected by its song, a series of three piercing whistles, the last of which is long and grating. If seen, note dark brown plumage, speckled gray throat and chest, and long broad tail. Found on only a handful of forested mountaintops in Borneo’s Crocker Range, where it skulks about in tangled mossy areas with extensive fallen debris."
0,Friendly Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura albolimbata,https://ebird.org/species/frifan1,"A fairly small, long-tailed bird of montane forest and edge. Uniform dark, slaty-gray with blackish face and wing. White throat, short brow and mark behind the eye, dotted wing bars and tail tip. Fairly tame as the name suggests. Forages actively like other fantails, with tail cocked, fanned and wings drooped. Sometimes joins mixed flocks. Similar to Northern Fantail, but Friendly is smaller with dotted white wing-bar and white stripe behind the eye. Song, a slightly metallic, jumbled series of high-pitch notes."
0,Frilled Coquette,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Lophornis magnificus,https://ebird.org/species/fricoq1,"Tiny hummingbird that is gray and green above and gray below. Like other coquettes it has a white bar across the rump. Males are astonishingly pretty with an orange crest, a ruff of white and green feathers on the neck, and a red bill with a black tip. Females have a white belly, and spotted throat, lacking the male’s crest and orange bill. Found at forest edges, in second growth habitats and in wooded savanna."
0,Frilled Monarch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Arses telescopthalmus,https://ebird.org/species/frimon1,"A slender, medium-sized bird of lowland and foothill forest interior. Fairly long tail and black face with gray bill and blue eye wattle. Male has white belly and collar, black tail, back and wings with a white wing patch. Female has orange chest, throat and collar with rufous tail, back and wings. Limited overlap with the similar Ochre-collared Monarch, but Frilled male has a white rather than orange collar, and the female a rufous rather than brown back. Voice, a series of buzzing notes, sometimes interspersed with a high-pitched “whip”, and an up-and-down whistled song."
0,Fuegian Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago stricklandii,https://ebird.org/species/fuesni1,"Large and heavy-bodied snipe of remote islands around Tierra del Fuego; very rarely seen and poorly known. Favors tussock grass and wetland habitats with grassy cover, where it runs in preference to flying, but can be very confiding. Plumage is similar to the more common and frequently seen South American Snipe, which has “normal” snipe proportions and is not fat-bodied like the Fuegian Snipe. Fuegian is often darker overall than South American Snipe, with dense pale spotting on upperparts and heavier dark barring on a buffy (not white) belly and thicker legs."
0,Fujian Niltava,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Niltava davidi,https://ebird.org/species/fujnil1,"A large flycatcher of tropical and subtropical forests. Male is bright blue above with a black face and orange breast and belly which becomes paler toward the vent. Rufous-bellied Niltava is extremely similar but has a bright patch on the shoulder and brighter orange underparts are uniform in intensity down to the vent. Vivid Niltava can also be similar but has an orange throat and is darker blue above. The mostly brown female is difficult to identify, but it is cooler and grayer overall compared to female Rufous-bellied. Female Fujian has a small bright white collar that is lacking in female Vivid.

Quail-like, it is secretive and terrestrial, scuttling between shrubs; most frequently seen when flushed suddenly at close proximity, flying away on whirring wings. The female has an orange-rufous wash to the breast and face and bright yellow legs, while the male is duller. It inhabits tussock-like restio-dominated fynbos around 50 cm tall, preferring coastal plains but occurring up to 1500 m in altitude. It’s likely nomadic, shifting between patches of suitable post-burn habitat 3–5 years after fire. Its call, given mostly at night, is a low, deep, repeated “oooooooppp”, slower and longer than that of Black-rumped Buttonquail."
0,Fülleborn's Boubou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius fuelleborni,https://ebird.org/species/fuebou1,"Mid-sized bushshrike that is completely black. Found in the undergrowth of humid forest at middle and high elevations. A skilled skulker that is most often detected by voice. Gives a wide variety of vocalizations, which include whistles, explosive notes, frog-like calls, and ratchets. The most common vocalization is a quick series of three whistles: “whit-whit-wee.” Very similar to Slate-colored Boubou, but found in montane forest rather than lower-elevation savanna and woodland."
0,Fülleborn's Longclaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Macronyx fuelleborni,https://ebird.org/species/fuelon2,"A large pipit-like bird with a golden-yellow throat and eyebrow emphasized by a circular broad black necklace and pumpkin-buff-colored belly and vent. The upperparts are subdued plain gray-brown and the outer tail corners are white, a key feature in flight. Pairs occupy upland grassland, dambos (seasonally flooded wetlands), and grassy savanna, especially close to water. It often perches up singing a strongly whistled “tu-wee-ti-chuuu” and variations thereof. The larger Yellow-throated Longclaw differs from Fülleborn's Longclaw by having a brighter yellow belly and vent, streakier head and neck, and distinct black streaking on the breast below the black necklace."
0,Gabar Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Micronisus gabar,https://ebird.org/species/gabgos2,"A small, slender grayish hawk with a distinct hood and a white rump; resembles a miniature chanting-goshawk.

Very similar to Coquerel’s Coua, but much larger, with pink facial skin. Similar to Red-capped Coua, but much larger, with a rufous belly."
0,Giant Cowbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Molothrus oryzivorus,https://ebird.org/species/giacow,"Rather large blackbird of tropical lowlands; male is much larger than female. Found in forest edges, pastures, orchards, and open grassy areas along rivers; often in small groups. In breeding season, hangs around oropendola colonies, where it lays its eggs in oropendola nests and relies on them to raise its offspring. Thick neck accentuates small head with very stout, pointed bill. Flight is strong and fairly direct, with distinctive flap-flap-flap-glide progression. Eye color varies: red in Mexico and Central America, yellowish in parts of South America."
0,Chattering Giant-Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Gymnomyza viridis,https://ebird.org/species/chagih1,"A very large, robust honeyeater. Entirely drab grayish-olive, with yellowish wings and tail and a bright yellow bill and eye-ring. Dependent on primary mature forest, mostly in the lowlands, but less commonly above 600 meters of elevation. Similar to Northern Wattled-Honeyeater, but much larger, and overall more yellow with a distinctive pale yellow bill. Does not vocalize often, but most common call is a very, very loud, ringing, far-carrying “kee-too.”"
0,Giant Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Patagona gigas,https://ebird.org/species/giahum1,"Largest hummingbird in the world, with its size compensating for rather drab plumage; no similar species. Plumage is drab greenish above with a big whitish rump patch and dingy below with variable rusty tones and dusky spotting. Favors rather open and dry habitats from matorral and gardens to Andean scrub; often perches conspicuously atop bushes or on roadside wires. Flight is “slow” with powerful wingbeats, often hovering in jerky manner and chasing insects. Loud sharp calls can draw attention."
0,Giant Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Pseudibis gigantea,https://ebird.org/species/giaibi1,"A hulking gray ibis the size of a large goose and with a distinctively long-bodied appearance, this increasingly rare scimitar-billed waterbird is unmistakable in its limited range. Size alone separates this species from other ibises that share its range; also note wrinkly bald head, dark back, and beautifully scalloped wings. Forages singly, in pairs, or in small flocks. Inhabits lowland plains, moving in response to water availability, occasionally gathering at waterholes during especially dry periods. Forages in marshy or flooded openings in wooded areas, and roosts and nests in nearby trees. Gives loud rolling bugles at dawn and dusk."
0,Giant Kingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus cubensis,https://ebird.org/species/giakin1,"A large flycatcher typically found singly or in pairs hunting from upper branches in wooded areas. It is grayish above and whitish below with a blackish crown and face, which resembles Eastern, Gray and Loggerhead Kingbirds, but none have the truly massive bill of the Giant Kingbird. Eastern Kingbird can also be separated by its bold white tail band, which is absent on Giant Kingbird. Gray Kingbird has a paler head with a dusky mask unlike Giant Kingbird. Loggerhead Kingbird has a gray tail band and its tail is typically squared off whereas the tail is usually notched in Giant. Calls include a squeaky “trrp-bee-bee-bip,” a shrill “trrree-bip,” and various peeps and chatters."
0,Giant Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Megaceryle maxima,https://ebird.org/species/giakin3,"A massive, chunky, black, white, and chestnut kingfisher with a huge dagger-like black bill and a small crest. Sexes differ in the location of chestnut plumage: upper breast on the male, belly and underwings on the female. Pairs patrol freshwater rivers, lakes and swamps, and saltwater estuaries, mangroves and coastlines, hunting for fish, crabs, frogs and invertebrates. Draws attention to itself with raucous harsh and rapidly repeated “kek” and “kakh” calls."
0,Giant Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Ianthocincla maxima,https://ebird.org/species/gialau1,"Large brown laughingthrush with an orange face and white-spotted back and wings.

0,Giant Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta magna,https://ebird.org/species/gianut1,"The largest nuthatch in the world, about the size of a bulbul. Coloration similar to many other nuthatches: gray above and white below, with a thick black line through the eye. Picky in its habitat preferences and as a result generally uncommon or absent through much of its range; requires extensive stands of mature tall pines in foothills and montane regions. Can be quite loud, giving a hoarse chatter reminiscent of a corvid; also gives a clipped fluty whistle."
0,Giant Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Hydrornis caeruleus,https://ebird.org/species/giapit1,"Extremely elusive and rarely-seen ground-dweller; listen instead for its haunting whistle. If seen, overall size and chunkiness alone should be sufficient to distinguish this species from other pittas. Male has bright blue wings and a grayish head with a thin black line curving downwards from behind the eye. Female is browner overall, with a blue rump and warm rufous-brown wings. Rare in lowland and foothill forests, particularly in swampy or riparian areas."
0,Giant Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus gurneyi,https://ebird.org/species/mineao1,"The largest scops-owl. Inhabits lowland and lower-elevation montane forest. Brown above and whitish below, with dark teardrop-shaped streaks on the chest and sides, a white V-shape between the eyes, a facial disk with a dotted black border, and orange around the large eyes.

0,Gilded Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Capitonidae,Capito auratus,https://ebird.org/species/gilbar1,"Large, boldly marked barbet of lowland rainforest. Plumage is variable: throat and breast range from yellow to red while the rest of the body is marked yellow and black. Found in a variety of habitats from forest edge to mature rainforest. Its hooting song is far reaching and can be told from other barbets by its pattern: a series of doubled hoots that accelerate."
0,Gilded Flicker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Colaptes chrysoides,https://ebird.org/species/gilfli,"Large woodpecker, very similar to Northern Flicker. Overall pale sandy brown with gray face and brown crown. Spotted below with black oval on chest. Underwing and shafts of flight feathers bright yellow. Males have red mustache stripe; sexes otherwise alike. Combination of face pattern and yellow in wings helps distinguish from both ""Red-shafted"" and ""Yellow-shafted"" Northern Flickers. Shows a strong affinity for saguaro cactus but also found in nearby woodland. Gives a piercing ""kleer"" call similar to Northern Flicker."
0,Gillett's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra gilletti,https://ebird.org/species/gillar1,"A typical-looking medium-sized lark of dry savanna and thornscrub. There is a pale eyebrow between a rufous crown and cheek, and rufous streaking on the breast. The wings show no obvious panel of rufous in flight. Foxy Lark can also be quite rufous, but Gillett’s Lark is separated by its contrasting rufous crown and cheek patch. Its bill is longer and slimmer than Singing Bushlark’s. Its song is a simple phrase of several high-pitched, tinkling notes, usually in a descending pattern."
0,Glaucous Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus hyperboreus,https://ebird.org/species/glagul,"Very large, pale gull. Adults are mostly white with a very pale gray back; note pure white wingtips. Immatures are white or pale tan with light brown markings; also look for the distinctive pink bill with sharply demarcated black tip. Most similar to Iceland Gull but larger, larger-billed, and usually even paler; Iceland typically shows more dark markings on wingtips. Also note shorter wingtips on Glaucous that do not extend far past tip of tail. Breeds in the High Arctic; winters farther south in a variety of habitats, rarely far from a large body of water. Often seen in small numbers mixed with flocks of other large gulls. Hybridizes with Glaucous-winged Gull and Herring Gull in parts of range; hybrids can show any mix of intermediate traits and are sometimes best left unidentified."
0,Glaucous Macaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Anodorhynchus glaucus,https://ebird.org/species/glamac1,"Mysterious and likely extinct, this large and magnificent macaw was only known from now much-reduced open grassy habitats with substantial palm stands. Very similar in appearance to Hyacinth and Indigo Macaws (neither of which overlap in range), but notably more greenish overall, with a grayish head and bare yellow skin around the eyes and at the base of the lower bill. Remoteness of habitat, combined with persistent reports by local communities, suggest that this impressive species may still persist, albeit in extremely low numbers."
0,Glaucous Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Thraupis glaucocolpa,https://ebird.org/species/glatan1,"Medium-sized tanager with gray head and back, blue-gray chest, white belly, and aquamarine wings.

0,Glossy Black-Cockatoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Cacatuidae,Calyptorhynchus lathami,https://ebird.org/species/glbcoc1,"Smaller brownish-black cockatoo of eastern Australia. Male fairly plain except for bright red tail panels. Female has blotchy yellow patches on neck and face and orange-red tail panels. Large bill used to feed on Allocasuarina and Casuarina seeds. The species is entirely dependent on these trees, and recently chewed seed-cones are good indicators of their presence. Usually observed in small groups rather than large flocks. Calls include drawn-out notes with a rougher, croakier tone than Red-tailed and Yellow-tailed Black-Cockatoos."
0,Glossy Flowerpiercer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa lafresnayii,https://ebird.org/species/gloflo1,"This glossy-black flowerpiercer has a distinctive silvery patch on the shoulder. Most similar to Black Flowerpiercer, which is smaller and lacks the shoulder patch in most of its range (although in east Andes in Colombia, Black Flowerpiercer has a small gray shoulder patch). Sexes similar. Also note the typical flowerpiercer bill: uniquely upswept with a hooked tip. Found in the Andes from western Venezuela to northern Peru from around 2,700–3,700 m. Typically seen singly or in pairs foraging at all levels in stunted forest and shrubby woodlands. Usually found in more humid areas than Black Flowerpiercer. Sometimes follows mixed-species flocks."

Call, a high-pitch, ringing “slik!” or longer, slurred “siikilik!”."
0,Goliath Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus goliath,https://ebird.org/species/golcou1,"An unmistakable massive black cuckoo with creamy-white wing patches that are visible both perched and in flight. Rare pale forms also occur that have pale heads and variable buff areas on their bodies. Juveniles similar to typical dark adults, but show chestnut on the underparts. The species is found in pairs or small groups within dense tangles in the understory of forest and in nearby thick undergrowth. Often detected by call, a series of deep, very low-pitched “boop” notes, descending toward the end. Also gives a very different, harsh, scraping “chow” call in alarm."
0,Goliath Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea goliath,https://ebird.org/species/golher1,"This enormous heron stands 1.5 meters tall and has a robust, dagger-like bill. The immature has rustier upperwings than the adult. Its flight is ponderous and labored. Goliath Heron inhabits large rivers, marshes, estuaries, and mangroves, hunting for large fish and other animals, stabbing them with an open bill. It has a distinct, barking “kowoork” call that can be heard from up to 2 km away. Purple Heron has similar plumage, but Goliath Heron is twice the size, has a much larger bill, and has a rufous (not blackish) top of the head."
0,Gorgeted Puffleg,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Eriocnemis isabellae,https://ebird.org/species/gorpuf1,"Rare and endangered hummingbird found in the Andes of southwestern Colombia. Accessing its tiny known range is difficult, and only a few intrepid and lucky birders have seen one. Male looks quite dark, but has a glittering blue throat bordered on both sides by iridescent green as well as white leg puffs and a blue vent. Female is mostly green with a buffy tinge to the underparts, faint whisker marks, and smaller leg puffs; she is similar to female Glowing Puffleg, but typically has a fainter throat patch and less buff on the neck. Inhabits stunted cloud forest at high elevations."
0,Gorgeted Sunangel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Heliangelus strophianus,https://ebird.org/species/gorsun1,"Unmistakable; glittering pinkish-purple throat is distinctive in good light, but also note the snowy white chest band, which is always obvious. Medium-sized with a rather short, straight bill. Like other sunangels, holds wings out for a few seconds after it lands. Based on plumage, could be confused with Purple-throated Woodstar, but the sunangel is larger with a much different flight style. The only sunangel within limited range on the west slope of Andes; occurs mostly in Ecuador, but barely extends into Colombia. Occurs in a rather narrow elevational band in the upper subtropical zone from around 1,700 to 2,300 m. Can be seen at all levels in the cloud forest, edges, and gardens, but most frequently at middle heights within the forest. Visits feeders."
0,Gorgeted Wood-Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Odontophorus strophium,https://ebird.org/species/gowqua1,"Scarce quail restricted to cloud forest in the northern half of Colombia’s eastern Andes. Adult has distinctive black and white crescents on the throat, which may be reduced or lacking in young birds. Male has chestnut underparts and white spots on the breast; female has gray underparts. Shy and not often seen, but with luck it may be encountered in small groups that walk on the forest floor. Song is like that of other wood-quails, a long and rollicking series of whistles."
0,Gorgeted Woodstar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Chaetocercus heliodor,https://ebird.org/species/gorwoo2,"Woodstars are tiny hummingbirds that fly like bumblebees. Gorgeted Woodstar is found in the subtropical and temperate zone of the Andes from Venezuela to Ecuador, where it inhabits cloud forest, edges, and second growth. Males are deep emerald-green (more of a bluish tone than other woodstars) with a glittering wine-colored throat and white patches on the sides of the rump. Females are trickier; note the rufous rump and tail with a black band at the base, extremely small size, short tail, and buffy infusion on the throat. On both sexes, bill often appears slightly decurved, more than other woodstars. Sometimes seen singly feeding in the canopy or at lower patches of flowers. Visits feeders."
0,Gosling's Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis goslingi,https://ebird.org/species/gosapa1,"A small, slender plain apalis with sooty-gray upperparts, pale gray underparts, a pale throat, and a shortish white-tipped gray-brown tail; eyes are red-brown. Juvenile is paler than adult, with dingy yellowish underparts. A local resident inhabiting middle levels of both primary and patchy degraded forest, especially along streams, in the northeast Congo Basin, where no similar apalises occur. Vocalizations include a rapid, monotonous strident “swit-swit-swit-swit” and “tet-tet-tet.”"
0,Gosling's Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza goslingi,https://ebird.org/species/gosbun1,"A bunting with cinnamon underparts, black-and-brown mottled upperparts, and a black-and-orange bill. The male’s head is boldly striped black-and-white and the throat is pale gray. The female’s head is less contrasting, with gray and buff stripes, and the throat is streaked blackish-brown. Juvenile is duller than adult. Prefers rocky outcrops, quarries, and gullies in arid and moist savanna and semi-desert, favoring open ground. Often found in pairs. It is often detected by its grating song. The similar Cinnamon-breasted Bunting differs from Gosling’s Bunting by having a black (not gray or blackish-brown streaked) throat and less rusty wings; birds in northern Ethiopia/Eritrea may be part of a hybrid swarm. House Bunting has a streaked (not solid) throat and breast."
0,Gough Island Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Rowettia goughensis,https://ebird.org/species/goifin1,"A large striking finch with a dagger-like bill and different looking sexes. Male is mostly olive with a black throat and yellow eye-ring and moustache; female is brownish and lacks the black throat. Juvenile similar to female but heavily streaked. A critically endangered species endemic to Gough Island, where it is the only songbird; pairs and family groups are widespread on the island, preferring areas above 300 meters of elevation.

Similar to Common Moorhen, which is a vagrant to the Tristan group, but stouter, with a black neck and underparts, no white on the flanks, and mostly red legs blotched with yellow (not all yellow as in Common). Juvenile has yellow legs but is flightless. Native to Gough Island and introduced on Tristan Island. Fairly common but somewhat secretive on both islands, preferring tussock grass and thickets below 500 meters of elevation. Calls include an electric rapid “cher-cher-chuk” and a soft “ek” in contact."
0,Gould's Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus stellatus,https://ebird.org/species/goufro1,"Cryptic, seldom-seen nightbird of lowland and foothill forests. Unlike other small frogmouths, sexes are alike. Light morph is bright rufous with scattered white dots on the wings and mottled-white underparts. Dark morph is brown but with the same general patterning. Compare with Sunda Frogmouth: male Sunda is much more heavily marked with white above and has patchier markings on the underparts, while female Sunda has a prominent white band across the chest. Sumatran and Bornean Frogmouths inhabit higher elevations. Song is a loud “weeow-wah.” Calls include “weeow” and a rapid series of “wuk” notes that resembles a thrush’s alarm call."
0,Gould's Jewelfront,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Heliodoxa aurescens,https://ebird.org/species/goujew1,"Chunky hummingbird with a stout bill. Glittering green with a huge orange breast patch and purple forehead. Male has a black chin; female lacks this and has a short, whitish mustache stripe.

Note distinctive dark gray cap extending from the crown down the sides of the face, nape and neck to the wing, contrasting with white face. Upperwings dark gray with distinctive dark ‘M’ that extends across the wings. Underparts all white apart from a broad black band at the bend of the wing which extends towards the tip and diagonally back towards, but not reaching, the body. Two subspecies; breeds off of New South Wales and along the central mountain range of New Caledonia respectively. Migrates east and north across Pacific Ocean after breeding. Distinguished from other gadfly petrels by darker cap, and broader dark band on underwing. Can be seen feeding in association with other seabirds, tuna and dolphins."
0,Gould's Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx stellata,https://ebird.org/species/gousho1,"Bizarrely for the cover-loving shortwings, this species breeds on treeless alpine slopes, where it takes shelter behind boulders instead of leaves. Coloration is unlike that of any other shortwing: bright rusty-orange above with an extremely finely barred throat and round white spots on the flanks. Descends into subalpine forests, where it can often be found in dense vegetation near streams."
0,Gould's Toucanet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Ramphastidae,Selenidera gouldii,https://ebird.org/species/goutou1,"Beautiful small, multicolored toucan. Males have a black crown and underparts; in females, the black is replaced by chestnut. Note the black and orange patches on the bill. Inhabits lowland humid forest, seasonally flooded forest, gallery forest, and old second growth. Forages from middle levels to the canopy, usually in fruiting trees.

Juvenile dull olive above, pale below, with paler bill than most other small finch-like birds. Feeds on the ground; when disturbed, flushes into trees, showing a flash of bright green backs. Inhabits grassy open woodlands across northeastern Western Australia, the Top End of Northern Territory, and parts of northern Queensland."
0,Grace's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga graciae,https://ebird.org/species/grawar,"A small gray warbler with a bright yellow throat and eyebrow. All plumages are very similar; immatures are slightly duller and browner. Occurs in pine forests from the southwest U.S. to Nicaragua. Usually stays high in the canopy. Listen for a choppy musical trill, often broken into two parts. Compare with “Audubon’s” Yellow-rumped Warbler, which has yellow on the sides and rump no yellow eyebrow, and yellow restricted to the throat (not breast)."
0,Graceful Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Microptilotis gracilis,https://ebird.org/species/grahon2,"A small olive-gray honeyeater with a circular pale yellow cheek patch and a relatively fine bill. Can be confused with Lewin’s Honeyeater and Yellow-spotted Honeyeater, but note the shape of the cheek patch: crescent-shaped on Lewin’s Honeyeater and oval on Yellow-spotted Honeyeater. Adults also have a blue-gray eye while Lewin’s has a bluish eye and Yellow-spotted has a brown eye. Found on the Cape York Peninsula and southern New Guinea."
0,Graceful Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Erythropitta venusta,https://ebird.org/species/blcpit1,"Rare and secretive jewel of the Sumatran highlands. Found at 400-1400 meters in wet forest, especially in gullies and ravines. Dark overall, with a rose-red belly and an electric-blue “eyebrow” and wing lining; in good lighting, note deep maroon on chest and back. Hops around quietly, foraging amongst the leaf litter and fallen debris. Song is a haunting machine-like whistle that begins and ends abruptly."
0,Graceful Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia gracilis,https://ebird.org/species/grapri1,"Tiny, disproportionately long-tailed, active, and vocal. The upperparts are gray-brown with heavy dark streaking, the underparts are pale, and each tail feather shows both pale and dark tips. Generally found in rather moist habitats within arid zones, including field margins, riparian woodland, scrub, gardens, and wetlands; can be quite numerous. Very vocal, especially in spring. The song is a long series of dry chirps with a very slight pause between notes, subtly different from the rattling song of Delicate Prinia. Males often sing from obvious perches. Visually extremely similar to Delicate Prinia, but there is little overlap in range. In any areas of overlap, best separated by song, but Graceful is also slightly shorter- and broader-tailed and grayer."
0,Gran Canaria Blue Chaffinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Fringilla polatzeki,https://ebird.org/species/blucha3,"Endemic to the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands. Medium-sized finch with a strong and heavy bill, broken white eyering, and bold white wing-bars. Male is a striking dark blue-gray while female is brown-gray.

0,Grand Comoro Brush-Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Nesillas brevicaudata,https://ebird.org/species/gcbwar1,"A robust, medium-sized brown bird with a long, spiky tail. Endemic to the island of Grand Comoro. Found at middle and high elevations in humid forest, including thickets, clearings, edges, and tree heath at high elevations. An inconspicuous bird, except by voice, that skulks in thick vegetation. The vocalizations are “chek” and “veet” notes often given in a series. There are no similar warblers on Grand Comoro, so identification is simple."
0,Grand Comoro Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Hypsipetes parvirostris,https://ebird.org/species/combul1,"A medium-sized greenish-gray bird with a black cap and a carrot-colored bill, endemic to the middle and high elevations of the mountains of Grand Comoro. Found in humid forest and in adjacent plantations and secondary areas. Often in small, noisy groups. Very similar in appearance to Madagascar Bulbul, and they overlap at moderate elevations, especially in degraded habitats. Grand Comoro Bulbul is separated by the slightly larger size, the olive tint to the plumage, especially on the back, the yellowish tint to the underparts, and the paler belly and undertail. Its song is an unmusical series of rattling and scraping notes, often given from a high perch, similar to Madagascar Bulbul’s, but slightly lower-pitched and more metallic."
0,Long-billed Rhabdornis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Rhabdornis grandis,https://ebird.org/species/lobrha1,"A medium-sized, long-billed bird of foothill and montane forest in northern Luzon with a white throat and belly, a brown back, rufous wings and tail, a black mask with a thin white eyebrow above, a gray crown, and brown sides broadly streaked white.

0,Grandala,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Grandala coelicolor,https://ebird.org/species/granda1,"Often seen swirling in flocks above mountain passes, scrubby alpine forests, and highland meadows, this large thrush is unlike any other. Adult male is a deep, almost eye-searing blue with jet-black wings. Females and immatures are brown with white streaks all over the head and underparts and weak white bars on the wings. Long-billed and sharp-winged profile, along with flocking behavior, is more reminiscent of starlings than thrushes."
0,Grant's Bluebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Spermophaga poliogenys,https://ebird.org/species/grablu1,"A large, chunky-headed black-and-red forest waxbill with a blue-and-red bill. Sexes differ: the male has a red forehead extending to the midcrown and eyes that appear to be rimmed by black spectacles, while the female has white spots on the belly and red only on the throat and rump. Juvenile is like the female, but lacks spotting and red on the throat. A scarce and secretive resident in the undergrowth of lowland primary and swamp forest in the Congo Basin up to 1400 meters of elevation. Song is a mournful series of 7–8 descending notes “deeeee-deee-deee-deee-dee-doo-dee-doo.” Male Red-headed Bluebill is very similar to male Grant’s, but red extends onto the nape and eyes appear to have whitish rims; male Black-bellied Seedcracker has a blue-black bill."
0,Grass Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cistothorus platensis,https://ebird.org/species/sedwre,"Tiny, bubbly, buffy-colored wren of dense grassy or shrubby habitats. Fairly common but locally distributed from central Mexico to the southernmost tip of South America; surely comprises multiple species. Occurs from open grasslands and marshes at sea level up to paramo in the high Andes. Generally secretive, but perches up when singing. Generally pale brownish with complex patterning on upperparts; compare with much plainer House Wren. Variable voice, usually including harsh chips, buzzes, and trills."
0,Grasshopper Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Butastur rufipennis,https://ebird.org/species/grabuz1,"A small, slim, fairly long-tailed buzzard. Gray and brown on the upperparts and rufous on the underparts. The white throat has a black line down the center. In flight, reveals distinctive rufous patches on the tops of the wings, with mostly white underwings. Found in a variety of savanna and grassland habitats. A migratory species that is often found in flocks, especially near fires. Best told from other buzzards by its structure, and in flight by its rufous wing panels. The call is a series of “ki” notes."
0,Grasshopper Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Ammodramus savannarum,https://ebird.org/species/graspa,"Small, short-tailed, flat-headed sparrow found in weedy grasslands. Warm buffy coloration with clean unstreaked breast. Thin white eyering and yellow patch above eye. Back and wings are patterned with gray and rufous. Easy to see when singing atop a shrub, but can be very secretive much of the year. Best detected by its dry, insect like trill preceded by a few introductory notes. Typically not in flocks."
0,Grassland Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Ammodramus humeralis,https://ebird.org/species/graspa1,"Small sparrow with a short tail found in grasslands including agricultural areas with grassy edges.

Juvenile duller. A scarce resident found singly and in pairs in the lower canopy and at middle levels of primary Albertine Rift Forest between 1760 and 2500 meters of elevation, preferring the edges of clearings. Highly localized, occurring in two isolated populations in Bwindi (Uganda) and Itombwe/Kahuzi (Democratic Republic of Congo), and inexplicably absent from ideal intervening habitat. May join flocks, but inconspicuous unless calling its soft high-pitched tinny “tsit-tsit,” repeated multiple times, and a rapid “tseet-tsit-tsit-sit-sit-it-it” in flight."
0,Grauer's Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina graueri,https://ebird.org/species/gracus1,"A cuckooshrike with a grayish head, throat, and upperparts and a white lower breast and belly; the male is dark slaty above with a mild sheen, and the female is matte gray with a buff vent. A scarce and extremely localized bird, restricted to the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, found in pairs in the canopy of western Albertine Rift mid-altitude and montane forest between 1150 and 1900 meters of elevation.

There is a white eyebrow and dark spotting on the throat and breast. Found very locally in high-elevation marshes of the Albertine Rift. Fairly secretive, but will perch up to sing. The song is a dry trill preceded by a couple of “chyet” notes. Very similar to Little Rush-Warbler, but has a bolder white eyebrow, dark chest spotting, and a very different song. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed warblers."
0,Grauer's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Macrosphenidae,Graueria vittata,https://ebird.org/species/grawar1,"Taxonomically unusual though not very boldly marked warbler. In poor light, or at a distance, looks dingy overall. A good look reveals a brown-olive back, and underparts that are heavily marked with fine barring. Found in thick understory tangles in montane forest of the Albertine Rift. Usually detected by its odd voice: a high, short, rising trill which sounds more like an insect than a bird. Most likely to be confused with Green-backed Camaroptera, but is larger, has a dark rather than red eye, and has fine barring below."
0,Gray Catbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Dumetella carolinensis,https://ebird.org/species/grycat,"Medium-sized songbird, smaller than a robin, with a smooth gray body, black cap, and rusty-red undertail.

Adults distinctive, all pale gray with thin white bars on underparts. Tail banded black and white. Juvenile is brown and streaky. Juveniles are similar to juvenile Broad-winged and Red-shouldered Hawks, but have bolder face pattern, paler underwings, and a small white patch at the base of the uppertail. Found in shrubby riparian woodland. Usually seen singly."
0,Gray Kingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/grykin,"A relatively pale kingbird, medium-gray above and white below with a darker face mask. Primarily a Caribbean species with limited range in U.S.; found around the edge of dense woodland, especially near the coast. Also seen in more suburban areas. Often perches conspicuously on a snag, treetop, or powerline. Feeds on insects. Listen for its high-pitched twittering calls. Compare with Eastern and Loggerhead Kingbirds; Gray Kingbird has lighter gray upperparts, a thicker bill, and lacks white tail tips."
0,Gray Thrasher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Toxostoma cinereum,https://ebird.org/species/grathr1,"Fairly large and long-tailed songbird found only in Baja California peninsula. Favors deserts with cactus, but also in adjacent scrubby woodland, thickets, and gardens. Feeds mainly on the ground, where runs well. Feeds less often in fruiting trees and bushes. Note the fairly long, slightly arched bill, golden eyes, and boldly spotted breast. Cactus Wren occurs in same areas and looks rather similar but is slightly smaller with white eyebrow, shorter bill, dark eyes, boldly barred tail, and different voice.

0,Gray's Grasshopper Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Helopsaltes fasciolatus,https://ebird.org/species/grgwar1,"An odd, thrush-like warbler; extremely shy and seldom seen as it lurks about in dense undergrowth. The largest grasshopper-warbler, with a distinctly robust appearance. Matte brown with pale brow, throat, and belly. Complete lack of streaking distinguishes this species from Middendorff’s and Pallas’s grasshopper-warblers; white throat and pale brow distinguish Gray’s from the much browner Pleske’s Warbler. Slightly warmer-colored Sakhalin Grasshopper-Warbler is extremely similar but has a whiter throat, a thicker brow, and more extensive brown on the underside."
0,Gray's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Ammomanopsis grayi,https://ebird.org/species/gralar2,"A stocky, pale, plain buffy-white lark that frequently matches the color of the stony terrain it lives in. Its dark-tipped pale gray-blue bill and white-fringed dark tail distinguish it. Pairs and flocks of up to 30 are resident and nomadic in barren gravel plains with sparse cover of grass and shrubs. Mostly at night, it sings a soft tinkling “tink tink” with upslurred “swee” whistles interspersed. Gray’s Lark is most similar to Tractrac Chat, but the latter flicks its wings and has a pale rump; Stark’s Lark has a crest and streaked upperparts, and female sparrow-larks have dark belly patches."

Long and heavy bill, gray crown and nape, brown forehead and upperparts, and buffy throat. Underparts and cheeks ochre with strong black barring. Sexes similar. Rare and difficult to see even when singing. Mostly in darker understory in very wet cloud forest rich in palms, on the floor or at mid-levels. Song is a long, trilled “Br’ur’ur’ur’ur’ur’ur’…” ending abruptly, very similar to Undulated Antpitta but more uniform in pitch and pace. Also very similar in plumage to Undulated Antpitta, which has a smaller bill and body size, as well a blackish moustache and less contrast between forehead and crown than Great. Endemic to Venezuela with three isolated populations."
0,Great Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Taraba major,https://ebird.org/species/greant1,"Strikingly patterned but very skulking bird of forest borders, thickets, and tangles in humid tropical lowlands; uncommon. Heard much more often than seen; typically sings from dense vine tangles. Song suggests some trogons, but ends with a quiet snarl audible at close range. Male is black above; female is rusty above. Both have clean white underparts, bright red eyes, stout hooked bills, and crests that can be raised or lowered."
0,Great Argus,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Argusianus argus,https://ebird.org/species/grearg1,"The great tail- and wing-fanning courtship display of the male Great Argus is among the most remarkable on Earth. At rest, the long feathers and tail feathers give the blue-headed male an excessively lengthy, freight-train-like appearance. Female more warmly colored than male but lacks long plumes and has paler blue head. Inhabits lowland to foothill forests with a relatively thin understory and mature trees, from which the male’s lovelorn-sounding courtship call “kow-WOW” resonates loudly, even as it remains frustratingly hidden."
0,Great Auk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Pinguinus impennis,https://ebird.org/species/greauk,"Extinct, last reported in 1844."
0,Great Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Megalaimidae,Psilopogon virens,https://ebird.org/species/grebar1,"This largest of the barbets is colorful, but often appears all-dark from a distance. No other barbet in its range combines the features of a massive pale bill, black head, and dark olive back. Sluggish and shy; tends to stick to dense forest canopy, where it is difficult to see. Its loud hooting song (typically a series of two repetitive notes) is often the only indication of this species’s presence. Also gives a harsh, screaming “karrrrr” that has a gull-like quality."
0,Great Black Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteogallus urubitinga,https://ebird.org/species/grbhaw1,"Uncommon in forest, marshes, and mangroves, where usually greatly outnumbered by similar Common Black Hawk. Slightly larger and lankier than Common Black Hawk, with longer legs and tail, and adults of the two species have very different calls in flight. Adult Great Black has 2 white tail bands (1 on Common) and less extensive yellow in face. Immature looks whiter-headed than Common (no big black moustaches), and its longer tail has narrower and more numerous pale bars. Usually warier than Common, which can be quite unconcerned by people."
0,Great Blue Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea herodias,https://ebird.org/species/grbher3,"Huge gray heron, no other similar species in range. Note large yellow-orange bill, short black plumes on head, and black and chestnut pattern on shoulder. Immatures are more brownish than adults, and have a dark crown. Fairly common and widespread throughout North America; wintering range extends to northern South America. Occurs in almost any wetland habitat, from small ponds to marshes to saltwater bays. Usually seen singly but can gather in numbers where food is plentiful. White form, sometimes considered a separate species (“Great White Heron”), is found in southern Florida and the Caribbean. It is most similar to Great Egret but has a larger bill."
0,Great Blue Turaco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Musophagiformes,Musophagidae,Corythaeola cristata,https://ebird.org/species/grbtur1,"Wonderful, cartoonish bird. Note the tall black crest and the red-and-yellow bill. The tail pattern is distinctive in flight: note the black bar across the end of the tail and the pale green sides. Found in rainforest, gallery forest, and lush secondary habitat. Usually in small groups. Gives two distinctive calls, sometimes in conjunction: a deep “jeeeow” and a rapid, cackling series of incredibly loud notes."
0,Great Bowerbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Chlamydera nuchalis,https://ebird.org/species/grebow1,"Large and noisy bowerbird. Bright pink crest can be raised and lowered. Primarily gray brown with white scalloping on the back. Females are smaller and may lack the pink crest. Males create a very large bower out of twigs and grasses; it is then decorated with small objects, which are often red, green, or white. Found in northern Australia, usually in dry woodlands."
0,Great Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Otis tarda,https://ebird.org/species/grebus1,"Huge, unmistakable, regal bird of treeless open plains and natural steppes, occupying some low-intensity agricultural areas. Walks in a stately manner, but may run rather than fly if disturbed. Flight is heavy and gooselike. Highly gregarious, especially in winter. Males are much larger than the females and the sexes do not mix much outside of the breeding season. Spectacular ""foaming bath"" display at leks (display sites) as males bristle their body and wing feathers forward, turning them white, while burying their head in the plumage."
0,Great Cormorant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax carbo,https://ebird.org/species/grecor,"Large cormorant found nearly worldwide. Note large size, white patch on throat, and lack of crest. Breeding adults show circular white patch on flanks. Immatures typically have contrasting white belly; African ""White-breasted"" also has extensive white underparts in all plumages. Often spotted standing on rocks or pilings.

Note the small, rounded head with only a vaguely crested look, and broken whitish eyering. Brown upperparts contrast with paler olive-gray underparts; also has pale wingbars. Typically found alone or in pairs, perching on the top of small trees and bushes. Occurs in scrub, forest edges, and savanna with small trees. Vocalizations are loud and variable; one common variation is a “SQUEE’ch’ch’ch-cheet-cheet” with both nasal and chattering notes. With a poor view can be surprisingly similar to Black-billed Thrush, but that species lacks wingbars and has a longer bill."
0,Great Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata minor,https://ebird.org/species/grefri,"A large black seabird that holds its wings in a distinctive crook. The long, forked tail may appear pointed when folded. Males are all black with a red throat pouch. Females have a white breast. Immatures have a white head and breast. All-dark plumage of male and lack of a pale “armpit” in female and immature separate this species from Lesser and Christmas Island Frigatebirds. Separation from Magnificent Frigatebird can be difficult; note pale wing panel in males and indistinct pale throat in females (Magnificent females have a clean all-dark head). Nests in trees and bushes on tropical islands. Often seen flying along the shoreline, sometimes very high, and sometimes inland. Chases other seabirds to steal their prey."
0,Great Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps major,https://ebird.org/species/gregre1,"Huge grebe with a long dagger-like bill, a dark gray head, and long, thin rufous neck.

Preys upon a variety of animals, including mammals, birds and reptiles."
0,Great Iora,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Aegithinidae,Aegithina lafresnayei,https://ebird.org/species/greior1,"A yellowish canopy-dweller with a long, powerful-looking bill. Male is dark above and yellow below, while female is ironically distinctive in her lack of distinctive characteristics; she is plain gray-green above and yellow below. Both sexes can be separated from other ioras by the proportionally larger bill, greater size, and lack of wingbars. Inhabits primary and late secondary broadleaf forests, as well as forest edge, in lowland and foothill regions. Song is a rapid-fire series of high-pitched “chew” notes. Like other ioras, frequently joins mixed-species flocks."
0,Great Jacamar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Galbulidae,Jacamerops aureus,https://ebird.org/species/grejac2,"The largest jacamar is glistening emerald-green above and orange below with a thick black bill. Sexes generally similar; males have entirely green throat and inconspicuous white collar, females have orange throat. Size and bill shape could recall a motmot more than a jacamar, but no motmot combines green head and orange belly. Singles or pairs are typically uncommon to rare in lowland forests, up to around 600 m. They typically perch in the middle to upper levels, and can be quite vocal. Listen for the long descending whistle with a noticeable break in pitch near the beginning, as well as various strange noises that sound like a very angry cat."

0,Great Potoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Nyctibiidae,Nyctibius grandis,https://ebird.org/species/grepot1,"A monstrous nightbird, superficially similar to an owl but not related. Pale mottled gray with large head; larger than other potoos and lacks a dark mustache stripe. Well camouflaged and difficult to spot; most often seen roosting on a horizontal limb during the day (less often on a broken off snag like other potoos). Found in forested areas and edges. Active at night, when it feeds on large insects. Listen for its terrifying call, a harsh descending scream."
0,Great Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus arundinaceus,https://ebird.org/species/grrwar1,"A hulking warbler that resembles Eurasian Reed-Warbler in coloration but far larger with a proportionately more massive head, heavy bill with a dark tip, and a broad, pale eyebrow. Breeds in reed beds, crashing through the reeds in short flights and bending stems when perched. Song short but very loud and memorable with repeated phrases of ""karra-karra-karra gurk gurk gurk chirrr-chirrr karra karra."" Call a high-pitched “krrrrr."""
0,Great Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus rubicilla,https://ebird.org/species/greros1,"As the name suggests, a large rosefinch. Male is bright pink with a dark face and frosty specks on the underparts. Female is streaky brown all over. Very similar to Streaked Rosefinch; look out for unstreaked upperparts in the male and softer, larger white spots on the underparts. Prefers more sparsely vegetated areas at higher elevations than Streaked Rosefinch, favoring alpine and subalpine scree slopes, boulder fields, and other open and barren environments; descends into similar habitat in the winter. Gives various chips, cheeps, and wheezy notes."
0,Great Rufous Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Xiphocolaptes major,https://ebird.org/species/grrwoo1,"Very large woodcreeper with a massive, robust bill. Plumage is rather uniformly cinnamon with some faint streaking on the breast. Note the black lores. Found in dry forest, woodland, and gallery forest.

0,Great Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Heinrichia calligyna,https://ebird.org/species/gresho1,"A shy, long-legged terrestrial flycatcher-like bird restricted to the mountains of Sulawesi. Male is largely dark blue with a blacker face. Female shows a diagnostic white smudge between the eye and bill, but forms differ in underparts coloration: in southeast females show a rufous throat and breast, central females have rufous limited to the throat, and northern ones have a rusty throat and breast. Juveniles are brownish-blue with pale throat streaking. Inhabits montane forest understory, on or close to the ground, often near rocky streamsides. Song is a lazy, thrush-like, melancholy warble comprising several quavering notes."
0,Great Skua,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius skua,https://ebird.org/species/gresku1,"Breeds locally on moorland of northern islands and coasts, where aggressive near nests.

Restricted to the native forests, scrubland, and upland tussock grasslands of the northwestern South Island of New Zealand. More often heard than seen, including loud sniffling as it forages at night for invertebrates. Male produces a series of burry, rising high-pitched whistles. Female has a lower ascending burry whistle. Pairs often duet. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Great Spotted Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos major,https://ebird.org/species/grswoo,"Most common pied woodpecker in most of Eurasia. Fairly common in almost all types of forest and woodland, parkland, gardens, even farmland with hedges and scattered larger trees. Feeds mainly on trunks and larger branches; also visits feeders.

Separated from the group of “small-billed” flamebacks by a much larger bill, a mottled black-and-white nape instead of a black nape, and a divided black horizontal stripe below the cheek. Separated from the similarly large-billed White-naped Woodpecker by a red rump, the lack of a clean white nape, and a preference for wetter habitat. Greater Flameback is a loose participant in mixed-species foraging flocks, often detected by its loud, high-pitched trill similar to that of Common Flameback."
0,Greater Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus roseus,https://ebird.org/species/grefla3,"Distributed from Africa and southern Europe through West Asia to South Asia. Very large, with long, ""coat hanger"" neck, big kinked bill, and very long pinkish legs. Plumage at rest whitish with pale pink blush and some deep pink often visible on closed wings. Flies with long neck and legs extended, when deep pink-and-black wing pattern striking."
0,Greater Flowerpiercer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa major,https://ebird.org/species/greflo1,"Small, dark gray bird of highland forest. Gray plumage is set off by chestnut undertail coverts and black mask and chin, which contrast with the pale silvery bill. Distinctive bill shape can be difficult to discern at a distance. Found only at high elevations (above 1000 m) in the tepui highlands, where it is a locally fairly common resident of humid forest and scrub. In taller forest, it is generally in the canopy but may occasionally descend into the understory. Often observed at fruiting and flowering trees and shrubs, where it plucks fruit and pierces into the bases of flowers to drink nectar. Also follows mixed-species flocks. Unusual song is a mix of high peeping and harsh grating notes; the peeping notes are also given as a contact call. Considerably larger than other flowerpiercers, and unlikely to be mistaken for other species in its limited range."
0,Greater Green Leafbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chloropseidae,Chloropsis sonnerati,https://ebird.org/species/grglea1,"Vivid green bird of lowland evergreen forest canopy where it joins mixed flocks. Male has a black mask and throat. The black throat also has a dark blue center, though this can be difficult to see in poor lighting. Female is clean-faced save for a pale yellow throat and a trace of a blue moustache. Generally smaller than the Lesser Green Leafbird, but the two can be maddeningly difficult to tell apart. On the male Greater Green Leafbirds, look for a more extensive black mask and no traces of yellow on the forehead, while on the female, look for a yellow (not green) throat."
0,Greater Ground-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Amalocichla sclateriana,https://ebird.org/species/grgrob1,"A medium-sized, pittalike bird of sub-alpine forest floor. Brown head and upperparts extending to the sides of the chest, pale gray underparts, with whitish throat, center of the belly and sometimes some scalloping on the chest. Note the strong bill and long legs. Shy and difficult to see. Same general shape and habits as the Lesser Ground-Robin, but Greater occurs at higher elevations and is much larger. Much more often heard than seen. Very distinctive, short, whistled phrase sounding like ‘What do you think?’ with the last note upslurred."
0,Greater Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator indicator,https://ebird.org/species/grehon2,"This large honeyguide is a mostly brownish bird with white outer tail feathers and an upright posture. It is one of the most distinctive members of its family and has frosted white edgings to the shoulder feathers. Sexes differ: the male has a pink bill, black throat, and large white “ear muffs’; the female has a dark bill and pale throat. The immature has a yellow throat and breast. Singles and pairs are inconspicuous in woodland, open cultivated areas, and gardens; they often raid bees’ nests to eat wax, eggs, and larvae. Most often seen in undulating flight; may also be tracked down by following its unique vocalization, a series of strident two-noted segments: “VIC-tor, VIC-tor, VIC-tor”."
0,Greater Kestrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco rupicoloides,https://ebird.org/species/grekes1,"Large pale-brown kestrel. Gray tail has broad black bands, and the back is heavily marked with black. Found in semi-desert, grassland, and arid savanna. Often perches conspicuously in an isolated tree.

Primary habitat is papyrus swamp, though sometimes uses other types of reedbeds and wet scrub. Quite shy and secretive. Sings frequently, a slow and low-pitched mix of both rasping notes and more musical notes that ends in a trill. Similar to Lesser Swamp Warbler, but larger and longer-billed, lacking a pale eye-stripe. Also similar to Great Reed Warbler, but shorter-winged, darker, and grayer, without an eye-stripe."
0,Greater Thornbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Phacellodomus ruber,https://ebird.org/species/gretho2,"Large and bulky thornbird with a long tail, conspicuous yellow eyes, and a whitish throat.

Often seen in flight, sometimes in small, loose flocks. Incredibly loud calls consist of rough squawks and low whistles. Can be very hard to separate from Lesser Vasa Parrot, but larger and bigger-billed, with a straight edge to the skin at the back of the bill. Vocalizations are lower-pitched and rougher than those of Lesser Vasa Parrot. Can easily be mistaken for a raptor in flight, but has all-black plumage unlike any raptor in range."
0,Greater Yellow-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sicalis auriventris,https://ebird.org/species/gryfin2,"Fairly common in the Andes of central Chile and adjacent Argentina; seen readily at ski resorts, around villages, on bogs, and on stony and grassy slopes. Often in flocks, associates readily with other seed-eating birds. Feeds mainly on the ground, but sings from prominent perches such as a rock or building. Not appreciably larger than other yellow-finches, but no similar species in most of range. May overlap in winter locally with Greenish Yellow-Finch, which has shorter wings and a shorter bill, and male never is as bright golden as the Greater Yellow-Finch."
0,Greater Yellowlegs,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa melanoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/greyel,"Fairly large shorebird with bright yellow legs. Plumage is essentially identical to Lesser Yellowlegs: gray upperparts with white speckling, streaky neck, and white belly. Proportions are most important for identification. Greater is larger overall with longer, thicker, more upturned bill, longer neck, blockier head, and bigger chest. Forages actively on mudflats and in shallow pools and marshes, often in loose mixed flocks with Lesser Yellowlegs. Somewhat more likely to be found in larger, more open habitats than Lesser, but much overlap. Listen for strong, ringing “tew tew tew!” calls, louder than Lesser, and usually three or four notes instead of one or two (though Greater can also give single notes)."

0,Green Aracari,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Ramphastidae,Pteroglossus viridis,https://ebird.org/species/greara1,"Common small toucan of rainforest canopy. The key field mark is the clear yellow belly that contrasts sharply with a dark breast. Usually seen in small groups at fruiting trees in clearings and at river edges. Like other toucans, sometimes rests on bare branches above the canopy; groups cross gaps in single file. Chuckling calls are woodpecker-like in quality. Similar to Black-necked Aracari in size, shape, and behavior, but lacks bands on belly, has a more colorful bill, and is more restricted to tall rainforest."
0,Green Avadavat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Amandava formosa,https://ebird.org/species/grnava1,"Very pretty small finch-like bird with red bill, red eyes, and distinctly barred flanks.

Slow-moving and restricted to the canopy, where it blends in with the foliage. If seen, the green body is most obvious, followed by the black and silvery-blue bands on the wing. A better look would reveal a sky-blue head with a thin black eye-stripe and a pale blue tail. Listen for its song, a high, thin, even-sounding whistle, often given repeatedly but difficult to pin down."
0,Green Crombec,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Macrosphenidae,Sylvietta virens,https://ebird.org/species/grecro1,"A small, virtually tailless olive-green bird. Note the slightly darker cap and the pale eyebrow. There is geographical variation in the color of the underparts, which vary from brown-and-gray to buff-and-yellow. Found at middle levels and in the understory of rainforest, secondary growth, and scrub, often in pairs or small groups. Very similar to Lemon-bellied Crombec, but slightly larger, longer-billed, and even the subspecies that shows yellow on the belly is duller yellow below than Lemon-bellied.

Male is dark olive-green with boldly black-and-white-striped wings; female is paler, with an olive back and a less contrasting wing pattern. Look for bright yellow “goggles” around dark eyes in both sexes; Common Iora lacks these goggles and has pale eyes, but these can be hard to discern. Song is high, simple, and repetitive: “wit-dee, wit-dee, wit-dee” or “chew-a-wee-chew, chew-a-wee.” Calls vary, but the most common ones are downslurred and rather nasal-sounding."

0,Green Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacara holochlorus,https://ebird.org/species/grnpar,"Bright green bird with long, pointed tail. Bill is dull pink. Some birds have red speckling on neck, but plumage otherwise uniform. Native to Mexico, but also found in small introduced colonies in southern Texas. Almost always seen in small flocks in wooded or suburban areas; gathers in large nighttime roosts. Feeds on fruit and seeds. Listen for high-pitched screeching calls."
0,Green Peafowl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Pavo muticus,https://ebird.org/species/grepea1,"An immense game bird of open tropical forests, often near water. Beautiful and unique within its range. Both sexes have glittering green necks, dark wings, and a dark green crest which is always held vertically. Males have the classic great train of the peacocks, which is opened and held up during courtship. Females have a short tail with no frilly plumes, but shares some of the train’s green iridescence. Males gather attendant flocks of many females, and advertise with a sad-sounding “awow-woh!”, often in the late evening or very early morning."
0,Green Pygmy-Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Nettapus pulchellus,https://ebird.org/species/grnpyg1,"Tiny duck. Male has dark green head and neck with a white cheek-flash.

0,Green Tinkerbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Lybiidae,Pogoniulus simplex,https://ebird.org/species/gretin2,"Small, drab, olive-green tinkerbird. The most distinctive markings are two yellow wingbars and a yellow rump. Also note the mostly dark bill with a pink base. Found in forest and lush woodland. Usually detected by voice: accelerating trilled phrases that are repeated, sometimes for a long time. Also gives a slower series of several tooting notes. Very similar to Moustached Tinkerbird, but only overlaps slightly in range, and separated by the plain face."
0,Green Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus nitidus,https://ebird.org/species/grnwar1,"Nondescript leaf warbler with two whitish wing bars (often only one visible), dull to bright greenish upperparts, a yellow wash usually restricted to the face, and a pale orange lower bill. Breeds in forest in the Caucasus mountains. Winters primarily in southern India, where it largely overlaps with the similar-looking Greenish Warbler. Although separable from Greenish Warbler by its greener upperparts, yellow on face, and the second wingbar (when present), Green is best identified by its loud, fast, trisyllabic “chi-su-wi” call."
0,Greenish Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis viridicata,https://ebird.org/species/greela,"Unobtrusive and inconspicuous small flycatcher of tropical and subtropical forest; also ranges up into the highlands of West Mexico. Usually found singly, perched quietly (unless singing at dawn) and rather upright at mid-upper levels in trees; does not flick its wings and tail, unlike many small flycatchers. Can be identified by a combination of the lack of pale wingbars, a narrow whitish eyebrow, and the small, overall dark bill."
0,Greenish Puffleg,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Haplophaedia aureliae,https://ebird.org/species/grepuf1,"A fairly dull green hummingbird with small white puffs at the base of each leg. Otherwise devoid of flashy field marks; look for a rather short straight bill, diffuse scaled appearance on the underparts, dark tail, and coppery sheen on the head. Sexes similar.

Song is a high-pitched long series ""tsit-psityee psityu-psi-ti-ti-ti-ti-si,"" but often detected by its call, a two-parted ""t-sli"" with flat or downward inflection. Similar to Green Warbler which co-occurs on wintering ground, best separated by call and Green's brighter green back and yellower underside."
0,Greenish Yellow-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sicalis olivascens,https://ebird.org/species/gryfin3,"Common in foothills of the Andes, from barren rocky canyons to villages, agricultural terraces, and scrubby hillsides, mainly at lower elevations than Bright-rumped Yellow-Finch, which favors puna habitats. Male is well-named—drab greenish yellow overall. Female is notably drab and nondescript. In all plumages note lack of any streaking or contrastingly bright yellow areas. Compare with longer-winged Greater Yellow-Finch (some overlap of range in winter)."
0,Grenada Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Leptotila wellsi,https://ebird.org/species/gredov1,"A somewhat large, chunky dove of dry scrub woodlands where it is typically found foraging on ground. Its plain plumage, the lack of white on the wings, and the very limited white on its tail, distinguish it from other doves on Grenada. Its song is a drawn out low, plaintive “Hooooooo,” loudest near start. Critically endangered."
0,Grenada Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiarchus nugator,https://ebird.org/species/grefly1,"A medium-sized “fly-catching” species of open woodlands and scrub including towns, preferring areas near palms; often sits still on perch for long periods of time before leaping forth in pursuit of insects. Grenada Flycatcher has a dull brown back and a yellow belly that contrasts with its gray chest and throat. The Caribbean Elaenia is passingly similar but is smaller with a proportionately small bill, and it has bold wingbars and dull, low-contrast underparts. Vocalizations include an emphatic low “whip” given in a slow series and sometimes followed by a rolling “pit-it-oooo.” Also, this species gives a shrill “whee,” singly or in series."
0,Grimwood's Longclaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Macronyx grimwoodi,https://ebird.org/species/grilon1,"A large pipit-like bird that is much less colorful than other longclaws, with a dull pinkish-buff throat, cinnamon-tawny underparts and extensive dense dark streaking elsewhere. During the breeding season the throat and belly may flush brighter pink, and a small white shoulder patch may be visible. Pairs are localized residents, preferring short grass on floodplains and dambos (seasonally flooded wetlands); retreating to wettest habitats where other longclaws co-occur. Calls an extended series of high-pitched trilling or buzzing notes that sound insect-like, different from other longclaws. Similar but smaller Rosy-throated Longclaw differs from Grimwood’s by having a bold black gorget and brighter pink throat and underparts."

Bold and adaptable, often foraging in and around villages and towns."
0,Ground Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Geocolaptes olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/growoo1,"A large, sociable, ground-loving woodpecker of open, lightly-vegetated country, where it prefers to perch on rocks. It has grayish olive upperparts, pale eyes, and a pink washed breast. Pairs and groups of up to eight birds prefer areas with boulders and earthen banks for nest holes. They feed on the ground, looking for ants and other insects. Calls a distinctive loud harsh ringing “skeaar” and a piping “che-weeka-weeeka-week”."
0,Groundscraper Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Psophocichla litsitsirupa,https://ebird.org/species/grothr1,"A tall, bold, long-legged, short-tailed thrush with gray-brown upperparts, heavily streaked white underparts, and a strongly marked face. In flight it shows distinctive large buff patches in the broad wings. The isolated simiensis race in the highlands of the Horn of Africa is warmer above and below and may be split as a separate species. Pairs and small groups occupy moorland, grassland, and open woodland, favoring heavily grazed and burned areas. It runs long distances on the ground hunting invertebrates, stopping bolt upright and flicking its wings. The song is a grating, unmelodic “lit-sit-siru-pa.”"
0,Growling Riflebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Ptiloris intercedens,https://ebird.org/species/magrif2,"A large bird of lowland and foothill forest in eastern New Guinea. The bill is fairly long, slightly curved and more feathered in the base than its sister species. Male is mainly black with a blue breast shield, bordered with a pale line below. Female and juveniles are brown above and pale below with dark barring. Almost identical to the more widespread Magnificent Riflebird but does not co-occur.

0,Guianan Gnatcatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Polioptila guianensis,https://ebird.org/species/guigna3,"Inconspicuous and rarely seen bird of rainforest canopy. Small and slender with a long tail; mostly dark gray with a broken white eyering, white belly, and white outer tail feathers. Inhabits canopy of tall forest, especially in regions with sandy soils, and also occurs in shorter-stature forests on white sand. Usually seen with mixed-species flocks as it forages actively in outer foliage, sallying for insects and gleaning from leaves, moving long tail from side to side, like other gnatcatchers. Thin and indistinct call notes are easily overlooked among calls of other species in flocks, but distinctive shape, active behavior, and long tail with much white should clinch identification. Distinguished from Tropical Gnatcatcher by uniform gray body plumage and lack of a black cap."
0,Guianan Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Notharchus macrorhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/guipuf1,"Chunky, large-billed bird of rainforest canopy; easily identified by black-and-white plumage, relatively large size, and staid demeanor.

0,Gundlach's Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter gundlachi,https://ebird.org/species/gunhaw1,"A secretive raptor of wooded habitats including mangrove swamps. Though this species sometime soars, its flight is usually powered by several rapid flaps followed by a brief glide. In flight, note the long rounded tail, short rounded wings, and a large head that protrudes well in front of the wings. Adults are barred orange below while immatures are streaked brown. The similar Sharp-shinned Hawk is somewhat smaller in body and head and has a shorter, squared-off tail. Migrant Sharp-Shinned Hawks from North America are scarce within this species’ range, and are best told by structure and size. Resident Sharp-shinned Hawks, which share this species’ range are conveniently barred gray below. Immature Sharp-shinned Hawks can also be distinguished from Gundlach’s by their narrow, but distinct white eyebrow. The Broad-winged Hawk is somewhat similar, but it is much shorter tailed and somewhat longer winged. The common call is an emphatic “eh-eh-eh-eh-eh…,” with the first couple notes quieter than rest."

Relatively long tail and broad wings with powerful flight. Generally darker above and paler below, with markings on belly ranging from small and crisp to big and chunky. Breeds on cliffs on Arctic tundra; winters in large open areas. Never common even on breeding grounds; rare everywhere in the continental U.S. Bulkier and shorter-winged than Peregrine Falcon with more diffuse face pattern and silvery undersides on flight feathers. Feeds on birds and mammals."
0,Hadada Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Bostrychia hagedash,https://ebird.org/species/hadibi1,"A large, bulky, gray-brown ibis with an iridescent green-purple gloss on the wings. It has a bicolored black-and-red bill and a white streak across the cheek under the eye. Pairs and small flocks occur in a variety of habitats including open country, wetland margins, and forest edge; they forages on the ground, digging, probing soft soil, and picking up invertebrates with their long bills. The frequently-heard call is one of the most characteristic sounds of Africa: a loud, raucous, trumpeting “ha-da-da” which gives the bird its name."
0,Hainan Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis hainanus,https://ebird.org/species/habfly1,"A small flycatcher found in the midstory of both wooded and bamboo forests in lowland and hill regions. Male is dazzling sapphire-blue with a dirty-white belly; lack of other markings or warm coloration distinguishes it from other flycatchers. Female is brown with a pale orange throat and chest. Often joins mixed flocks. Song is a short but pleasant series of throatily warbled whistles, typically a burst of ascending notes, followed by one or two falling notes, then a final rising whistle. Call is sharp “tsik-tsik-tsik”, akin to scissors snipping."
0,Hainan Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus hainanus,https://ebird.org/species/halwar1,"Beautifully luminous small leaf warbler restricted to the forests of China’s Hainan Island. Bright yellow all over, though darker wings and crown make paler wingbars and eyebrow visible nonetheless. Fairly distinctive in its limited range; Hartert’s Leaf Warbler also has a yellow cast but is duller overall and much larger, with a much more elongated appearance. Song is a short jumble of squeaky high-pitched notes akin to a machine that needs oiling."
0,Hainan Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila ardens,https://ebird.org/species/haipar1,"Small game bird restricted to the tropical rainforests of southern Hainan Island, where it is the only forest-dwelling partridge. Body is brown above and gray below; head is black with a bright white ear patch and an orange collar. Unlikely to be confused with the only other game bird in its habitat, the Hainan Peacock Pheasant, which is far larger and gray all over. Shy and far more often heard than seen; ringing song is often heard at dawn."
0,Hairy Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dryobates villosus,https://ebird.org/species/haiwoo,"Medium-sized woodpecker, common and widespread across North America as far south as western Panama. Black-and-white plumage is nearly identical to the smaller Downy Woodpecker. Focus on the bill: Hairy has a longer bill, about the length of the head. Also look for clean white outer tail feathers. Some variation in color across range; birds in western North America and especially Central America are brownish, with limited white in the wing. Occurs in wooded habitats with large trees. Familiar visitor to backyard feeders, especially fond of suet. Calls include a loud “peek!” and a fast rattle, stronger than Downy Woodpecker."
0,Hall's Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pomatostomidae,Pomatostomus halli,https://ebird.org/species/halbab1,"Large, conspicuous songbird with long decurved bill, very dark mask, broad whitish eyebrow, narrow dark-brown crown, and dark eye.

Forages mostly on the ground in chattering flocks, in western Queensland."
0,Halmahera Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox hypogramma,https://ebird.org/species/molhao3,"A brown owl with a rounded head, yellow eyes, and rufescent barred underparts. Inhabits forest in the lowlands and lower foothills, where it usually occurs in territorial pairs. Confined to the North Moluccas, where it overlaps with migrant Northern Boobook and Barking Owl, but can be separated from those species by its barred underparts and very different voice. Song is a gruff, abrupt, two-note frog-like “woo-wooo” with a slightly longer second note."
0,Halmahera Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Celebesia parvula,https://ebird.org/species/halcus1,"A medium-sized cuckooshrike from Halmahera with an entirely dark slate-gray body and a black face and throat. Singles and pairs occur within forest, principally in the foothills, but also in the lowlands. The species lacks the pale fringing on the wing feathers and pale spots on the undertail of Common Cicadabird, and further differs in its black throat. Much smaller, smaller-billed, and darker than Stout-billed Cuckooshrike. Gives a harsh, chattering “chit-it-it-it-it” song, characteristic of many cuckooshrikes."
0,Halmahera Flowerpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum schistaceiceps,https://ebird.org/species/flbflo3,"A tiny, dumpy, very short-tailed gray songbird. Paler underparts are divided by a whiter central strip. Males display a diagnostic red patch on the breast that is absent in females. Juveniles resemble female, but are duller, with a pale-based bill. Confined to the north Moluccas. Singles or pairs can be found in canopy of forest and forest edge in the lowlands and foothills. Tiny size and stunted shape aid identification in both sexes, as no other flowerpeckers occur in its range. Gives very high-pitched “tzeee” notes from the canopy, and a wetter “pip” call too."
0,Halmahera Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus infuscatus,https://ebird.org/species/molswi3,"A small dark brown swift with an indistinctly paler gray rump.

Limited to the north Moluccas. Marginally smaller than Uniform Swiftlet, and shows a neatly defined, subtly paler rump. In certain lights, Uniform Swiftlet can appear to have a pale rump, but it usually appears to cover a broader area."
0,Hamerkop,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Scopidae,Scopus umbretta,https://ebird.org/species/hamerk1,"A squat, brown, ibis-like bird with a bushy-crested “hammer-head”; often found near wetlands or rivers. In flight, it has distinctively deep wingbeats and may occasionally soar very high, when the long neck separates it from raptors. It struts about in wetlands foraging for frogs, fish, and insects. It needs nearby large trees for building its giant (1.5-m-across) stick nest. Calls include a high-pitched “nyip” in flight and a distinctive, rollicking call ending in a purring rattle “kyik-kyik-kyik-kyik-kyik kyik-keeek-kreeeeek”."
0,Hammond's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax hammondii,https://ebird.org/species/hamfly,"Small grayish flycatcher, very similar to other flycatchers, especially Dusky and Gray. Subtle differences include smaller bill with limited pale base, slightly more peaked crown, and longer wingtips. Also note habitat during breeding season: Hammond's prefers mature conifers, often seen higher up in trees than Dusky. Habitat overlaps more with other flycatchers during migration and winter; found in a variety of brushy wooded habitats. Back is greenish with a yellow wash to belly; fall birds in fresh plumage are brighter than spring and summer birds. Voice is key to identification, especially call notes: high-pitched ""peek"" and whistled ""peer."" Without an excellent view, silent birds often best left unidentified."
0,Handsome Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Nephelomyias pulcher,https://ebird.org/species/hanfly1,"A relatively bright small flycatcher of montane forests from Colombia to Peru. The underparts are yellow, with an especially rich orangish wash on the breast. Also look for the dark wings with bold yellow wingbars. Sexes similar.

0,Happy Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Pheugopedius felix,https://ebird.org/species/hapwre1,"Small, often very skulking wren of lowlands and foothills in West Mexico; endemic. Favors tropical forests, thorn forests, and thickets, usually with vine tangles. Heard more often than seen. Song a happy-sounding, repeated series of sweet whistles. Calls include a rising trill, like running your thumbnail along a comb. Plumage distinctive, with striped face bordered below by black whisker, and orangish underparts. Often occurs alongside and sometimes in the same bush as the much plainer and different-sounding Sinaloa Wren."
0,Hardhead,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya australis,https://ebird.org/species/wheduc1,"Chocolate brown diving duck with white rump and large white panels in the wings. Male has white eyes. Female is slightly paler with dusky eyes. Similar to Musk and Blue-billed Ducks, but Hardhead sits higher in the water, has a white patch on the rump, and lacks a spiky tail."
0,Harlequin Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Rhegmatorhina berlepschi,https://ebird.org/species/harant1,"Striking antbird with a cinnamon breast band and a bare eyering. Males have gray underparts, while females have buff underparts scaled with black. Has a very small global range, occurring in the understory of humid forests, where it attends army-ant swarms. The song is a series of descending whistles ending with a harsh “chirr.”"
0,Harlequin Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Histrionicus histrionicus,https://ebird.org/species/harduc,"Fairly small, boldly patterned diving duck that lives a seemingly dangerous life near fast-moving water and jagged rocks. Male is striking and unmistakable. Female is dark brown with small white patches on face; compare with female scoters but note smaller size and smaller bill of Harlequin. In summer, almost invariably seen in pairs on rocky streams where they breed. Gathers in small flocks on rocky coastlines in winter. Feeds on insects, fish, and aquatic invertebrates.

Male has a bold and beautiful pattern; female is plain brown. Found in habitats with thick ground cover, such as grasslands and crop fields. Shy and inconspicuous; usually seen when flushing from thick cover. Most often detected by voice, a three-part whistle in which a longer first “whit” note is followed by two quicker “whit” notes. Male is distinctive, but female is extremely similar to Common Quail, especially when seen only in flight. If seen well, female Harlequin Quail is darker and more uniform, without a bright white belly or bold streaking on the back. Females also similar to buttonquail, but with duller and less complex patterning. When flushed, Harlequin Quail also has stronger and more direct flight than buttonquail."
0,Harpy Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Harpia harpyja,https://ebird.org/species/hareag1,"Massive bird of prey, restricted to mature forest and always rare. Enormous talons. Adult is dark gray above, paler below, with obvious dark breast band. Note more obvious black-and-white barring on wings in flight to help separate it from Crested Eagle. Juvenile has whiter head than adult and no breast band; very similar to Crested Eagle but note longer crest with two points (separated in the middle). Feeds on monkeys and sloths. Usually seen perched in the canopy or flying across a road or river, does not soar."

This species has brown eyes, olive-green wings and tail, and white underparts. Found in evergreen forest understory, plantation, and thickets along the Angolan escarpment. Usually in pairs, hopping about, often low to the ground, searching for small insects. The two common vocalizations are a nasal “meehrrp” alarm call and a strident repeated snapping “strik-strik-strik-strik-strik” song. Very similar to Green-backed Camaroptera, but tail is brighter green, rather than gray or gray-green, and underparts are cleaner white, rather than grayish, especially on the breast."
0,Hartert's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus goodsoni,https://ebird.org/species/harlew1,"Bright yellowish leaf warbler of forest canopy. Like Blyth’s and Claudia’s leaf warblers, Hartert’s has the habit of flicking its wings alternately; compare to Kloss’s and Davison’s leaf warblers, which flick both wings at the same time. Bright olive above with a broad yellow brow and yellow-suffused white belly. Crown stripe and broad, orange-based bill distinguish this species from the similarly sized and shaped Arctic Warbler and Pale-legged Leaf Warbler. Breeds in foothill and submontane broadleaf forests, winters in various wooded habitats at lower elevations, including forest edge.

0,Hartlaub's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Chroicocephalus hartlaubii,https://ebird.org/species/hargul1,"A medium-sized, pale-gray-backed gull of coastal waters and human settlements. Breeding birds have dark eyes and a very faint chalky-gray hood, which non-breeding birds lack. This adaptable omnivore is the commonest gull of the Benguela Current, but its penchant for eating offal means it is expanding its range eastwards. The similar Gray-hooded Gull differs from Hartlaub’s Gull by being larger, having a yellowish-white eye, a longer redder bill, and a discrete grayish hood in breeding plumage. Immature Gray-hooded Gulls have a black terminal tail band which juvenile Hartlaub’s Gulls lack."

The distinctive head sports a strange bone-like casque and naked warty facial skin, which is colored white, blue, or red depending on geographic location. Young birds are brown and are almost always found with adults. It is common throughout its range, and large flocks roam the savannas, digging for invertebrates and tubers. Guineafowl often behave like lunatics, charging around issuing a loud and distinctive “kek-kek-kek-kraaaaaaah” alarm. It also calls a distinctive, plaintive “kuuuh-keeerk”. Crested Guineafowl differ from Helmeted Guineafowl by being darker and having a plumed crest on top of the head."
0,Helmeted Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Buceros vigil,https://ebird.org/species/helhor1,"Bizarre-looking bird, now very rare due to poaching for the ivory-like material of its bill. When perched, its most recognizable feature is the naked throat pouch which resembles an undercooked steak, chalky white in the female and dull scarlet in the male. When in flight, its long trailing central tail feathers easily distinguish it from any other hornbill. Scarce and difficult to see; listen for its far-carrying maniacal laugh in mature lowland and foothill forests."
0,Helmeted Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Antilophia galeata,https://ebird.org/species/helman1,"Males are striking with a mostly glossy black body, but with a red forehead, crest, and back. Females are uniformly olive-green and also crested. Locally common in gallery forests embedded in savannas where it often accompanies mixed-species flocks. The song is a trilling series of alternately soft and loud whistles."
0,Helmeted Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Basilornis galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/helmyn1,"A glossy-black starling with a big permanently raised crest that gives it a unique, broad-headed profile. Also note prominent whitish markings on sides of neck and breast, which appear like one large patch. Juvenile shorter-crested, with a brown chin and a bicolored bill. Frequents the canopy of lowland and hill forest in small groups or pairs, preferring pristine areas, but straying into edges and degraded patches too. Complex song involves whirring “weee-ow-weee-ow” mixed with “chur” and “chip” notes. Also gives a single, strident metallic “chip” call."
0,Helmeted Pygmy-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Lophotriccus galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/heptyr1,"Tiny flycatcher; common and widespread, but heard far more often than seen. When seen well, note pale eye and elongated crown feathers, giving this bird a hammer-headed appearance. Found in humid forest understory and second-growth as well as in savanna woodland. Frequently found near gaps and vine tangles where it sits quietly, then sallies upward to glean insects from leaves. Song is an irregular series of ticking notes that sometimes runs into a trill, often given for long periods throughout the day. Similar to Double-banded Pygmy-Tyrant, but vocalizations are less buzzy."
0,Helmeted Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Celeus galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/helwoo1,"Fairly large woodpecker. A usually rare inhabitant of extensive humid forests. Note cinnamon face, red head with a prominent crest, and white stripes on the side of the neck. Solid black back and wings, and heavily barred below with a pale rump. Males have a red moustache. A mimic of the much larger Robust Woodpecker."
0,Hemprich's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Lophoceros hemprichii,https://ebird.org/species/hemhor1,"A medium-sized dark-brown hornbill with a long tail. The bill is dull reddish and the belly white; there is white in the outer tail. The flight is floppy and loose. Found in dry savanna habitats, particularly on and around cliffs and other rocky microhabitats. Similar to Crowned Hornbill, but darker, with a duller bill and more white in the tail. The call starts with “keeya” notes, then usually progresses into a rapid piping."
0,Hen Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus cyaneus,https://ebird.org/species/norhar1,"Medium-sized harrier, flies with wings held in a V-shape, low over open fields and marshes, listening for rodents lurking below. Distinctive foraging behavior and conspicuous white patch on rump in all plumages. Five long primary ‘finger tips’ prominent in flight. Females and immatures are warm brown with streaky breasts. Adult male has plain mid-gray wings with black wingtips and paler belly."
0,Henderson Island Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Zapornia atra,https://ebird.org/species/heicra1,"An entirely deep black crake with bright reddish-orange eye-ring and legs.

Has a dusky gray chest and face, a yellow eye-ring, a magenta forehead patch, and mostly green wings and body. An adaptable species found at all elevations. Shares its range with no similar species. Call is typically a long series of “woot” notes, well spaced and gradually descending in pitch."
0,Henderson Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma atrata,https://ebird.org/species/henpet1,"A typical uniformly grayish-brown petrel with pale mottling at the base of the bill that gives it a somewhat “frosted” facial appearance. Pale bar along the leading edge of the underwing between the body and elbow is evident in flight. Highly pelagic, visiting land only to nest. Similar to Kermadec Petrel, but lacks the white primary shafts in the upperwing of that species and is overall more uniformly colored. Providence Petrel is similar but appears much heavier-chested and paler-faced, with more extensively mottled gray-brown tones across the body. Herald Petrel is very similar, but has much more contrasting dark-and-light underwing pattern. Henderson Petrel is silent at sea."
0,Henderson Island Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus taiti,https://ebird.org/species/hirwar1,"A large warbler with a variably white head and body. Crown and uppersides often mottled olive-brown and white, underside often tinted yellow. Wing feathers and tail darker. Found in undisturbed forest. Common call is a high-pitched single note. Not known to sing."
0,Henslow's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Centronyx henslowii,https://ebird.org/species/henspa,"A large-headed and thick-billed sparrow, found exclusively in weedy grasslands with sparse shrubs. Distinctive color combination of olive-green nape, rufous wings, and crisp black streaks below. Also note large pinkish bill and flat crown. Singing males perch conspicuously in the breeding season; otherwise very secretive, especially in migration and winter. Populations declining sharply, perhaps due to pesticide use and destruction of native grasslands. Listen for its extremely short song, easy to pass off as an insect: “ts-lick.”"
0,Henst's Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter henstii,https://ebird.org/species/hengos1,"A big, powerful goshawk. Adults are gray on the back with fine gray barring below; females much larger. Immatures have a brown back and thick streaks below. Endemic to Madagascar, where it is a scarce resident of all types of primary forest. Rarely sits in the open, and only occasionally soars. Territorial call is a loud repeated “khew” which is often given in flight. Males can be very hard to separate from similarly-sized female Madagascar Sparrowhawk. On Henst’s, look for fine bars on the undertail, a completely barred throat, and a central toe of normal length. Immatures may only be separable based on toe length. Also very similar to the rare Madagascar Serpent-Eagle. Subtle differences include slightly smaller size, evenly-spaced barring on the chest, thicker black bands on the tail, and an unbarred back."
0,Hepatic Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Piranga flava,https://ebird.org/species/heptan,"Large, stocky tanager. Males are red with dusty wash on upperparts and sides (especially on northern populations); females are muted yellowish. Both sexes are brightest on the throat and crown. Also note stout bill and dark lores. Several separate populations occur from the southwestern U.S. to South America, probably comprising multiple different species. Northern birds prefer mountainous areas with mixed pine-oak forest. South American birds found in a variety of forested habitats, from open woodlands in the lowlands to scrubby areas in the high Andes. Most similar to Summer Tanager, but grayer tones to plumage and usually different habitat. Song is sweet like American Robin: mostly clear phrases with some hoarser notes."
0,Herald Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma heraldica,https://ebird.org/species/herpet2,"Medium-sized, lightly built petrel of offshore tropical waters across the Pacific; not seen from mainland. Plumage is highly variable (from white-bodied and dark-headed to wholly dark) and often very similar to larger and broader-winged Kermadec Petrel, which has a shorter and broader tail than Herald. Herald has white flashes on underside of wingtips, but lacks white shafts on upperside, which are diagnostic of Kermadec. Both species visit colonies in daytime, when pairs chase around high overhead."
0,Herero Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis herero,https://ebird.org/species/hercha1,"Brown chat with a dark face mask, a pale eyebrow, and very faint streaking on the underparts. Found very locally in a specific microhabitat: the bands of somewhat lusher woodland around the base of rocky escarpments at the edge of the Namib Desert. Usually in pairs. Quiet but distinctive song is a four-note series of mournful whistles. Fairly similar to Familiar Chat, but easily separated by bold face pattern."
0,Hermit Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Catharus guttatus,https://ebird.org/species/herthr,"Medium brown above with contrasting reddish tail. Dark spots on breast do not continue all the way down belly like Wood Thrush. Found in wooded areas; often hops on the ground or skulks in dense patches of shrubbery. Winters further north than other thrushes; many stay in the U.S. Listen for its beautiful song that is higher pitched than other thrushes with a steady introductory note; also gives low ""chup"" call note."
0,Hermit Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga occidentalis,https://ebird.org/species/herwar,"Yellow-faced warbler of western coniferous forests. Males are almost entirely yellow-headed with black nape and throat, gray upperparts with white wingbars, and whitish underparts. Females much duller with pale throat and dingy gray belly, and always show a blank yellow face (some with faint olive cheek patch). Hybridizes with Townsend's Warbler where ranges overlap. Favors conifers on breeding and wintering grounds. Migrants found in a variety of wooded habitats. Feeds on insects, often high in treetops."
0,Hermit Wood-Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Henicorhina anachoreta,https://ebird.org/species/gybwow3,"Small, short-tailed wren endemic to the Santa Marta Mountains of Colombia. It has a white eyebrow and streaky face, though plumage is almost identical to that of Gray-breasted Wood-Wren. It can be identified by its faster, squeakier, and higher-pitched song, and it generally occurs at higher elevations with little overlap. Usually found in pairs that stay low in cloud forest understory. Quite common in the upper parts of El Dorado Nature Reserve, but not found near the lodge."
0,Heuglin's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Neotis heuglinii,https://ebird.org/species/heubus1,"A fairly large and lanky bustard. Males have a mostly black face, females a striped face. Both sexes have a gray neck and white belly. In flight, the wing is pale brown and black above and mostly pale below. A generally scarce species that is found in dry savanna, scrub, and other semi-desert habitats. Often in pairs. Similar to White-bellied Bustard, but the male is distinguished by his dark rather than pinkish bill, and the female by her gray rather than brownish neck."
0,Heuglin's Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus heuglini,https://ebird.org/species/hemwea1,"A small, yellow-eyed masked-weaver with a plain green back. The breeding male has a black face mask extending to a point on the upper breast, without a chestnut wash around the mask. Female and juvenile are duller, with a buff wash on the breast and a lightly streaked back. A fairly common resident throughout open savanna and semi-arid areas, often nesting colonially near ant and wasp nests. Many similar-looking weavers do not overlap in range with Heuglin’s: the larger Village and Vitelline Masked-Weavers have red eyes, and Lesser Masked-Weaver has a black (not yellow) forehead."
0,Heuglin's Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe heuglini,https://ebird.org/species/heuwhe1,"A brownish wheatear with a rusty breast. Note the white eyebrow, dark mask, and pale throat. The tail is mostly black with a white base and rump, forming a thick “T” pattern that is conspicuous in flight. Found in short grassland, cultivated areas, and open savanna, often in rocky areas. Very similar to Red-breasted Wheater, but there is little overlap in range, and Heuglin’s is smaller and darker, with a duller pale throat. The song is a long, complex mix of many different components, sometimes given in a flight display."
0,Highland Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia obscura,https://ebird.org/species/higela2,"Medium-sized flycatcher with a small head and long tail. Found in forests and second growth. Largely olive above with a light gray throat and flanks, and a yellow center to the belly. Note two pale wingbars."
0,Highland Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelopina nigra,https://ebird.org/species/higgua1,"Large, long-tailed game bird of humid evergreen forest in highlands and foothills. Mostly seen high in trees, as singles or pairs, where they can move quickly and slip away easily from view. Male is glossy black with bright red throat wattle and red legs (lacks whitish streaking on breast of the much larger Crested Guan). Female is barred brown and blackish overall. In spring, the male gives a piercing upslurred whistle, which it often alternates with an amazing crackling and crashing rattle in a gliding display flight."
0,Highland Rush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus centralis,https://ebird.org/species/hirwar2,"A nondescript long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Rusty-brown overall with blurry streaking on the breast. Found in wetland habitat, primarily reedbeds. Extremely secretive and skulking. Most often seen when it sits up to sing or gives a short display flight. Song starts with slow, hesitant, buzzy metallic notes that speed up, then ends with a trill made by beating the wings together at incredible speed. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed-warblers and swamp-warblers. Very similar to Little Rush Warbler, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Highland sings a much higher-pitched song."
0,Highland Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothocercus bonapartei,https://ebird.org/species/higtin1,"Rotund chickenlike bird, far more often heard than seen. Like a dove but body is even more circular and tail shorter. Most similar to Great Tinamou but generally found at higher elevations; also warmer rufous-brown below with small buffy spots on back and grayer head. Lives on the ground in montane forests. Shy and difficult to see; most often seen running away along a trail. Listen for series of repeated nasal call notes."
0,Hildebrandt's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis hildebrandti,https://ebird.org/species/hilsta1,"A beautiful starling of savanna country. The upperparts are iridescent, with a purple sheen on the head and green on most of the wing. Also note the orange underparts and eye. Found in moderately moist savanna and woodland, often in small flocks, sometimes with other species of starlings. Similar to Superb Starling, but doesn’t have a white chest band, underwing patch, or vent, and the eye is orange rather than whitish. Also similar to Shelley’s Starling, but slightly larger and paler overall, with a paler rufous belly and a more contrasting green wing. The common call is a raspy “cherrcherrcherr” that is incorporated into the rambling song."
0,Hill Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis whitei,https://ebird.org/species/hibfly1,"Medium-sized confusing flycatcher. Male is beautifully colored, with deep blue upperparts, orange throat and breast, and white belly. Note dark face and electric blue highlight on the forehead. Female is duller. Very similar to closely-related Large Blue Flycatcher: note marginally smaller bill without a noticeable hooked tip, less contrastingly pale throat, and darker legs. Male Hill Blue Flycatcher has more orange on the throat and a dark blue rump. Breeds in hilly and montane broadleaf thickets, often in areas with dense undergrowth; migratory birds winter at lower altitudes. Song mixes melodious warbling and whistling notes with harsh, rasping ones. Calls are a loud “chak” or “tak,” reminiscent of stones tapping."
0,Hill Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila torqueola,https://ebird.org/species/hilpar1,"A brightly-colored game bird with an intricate head pattern and a body shaped like a football. Brick-red on the crown serves to distinguish the male from the similar Rufous-throated Partridge, while male Hill Partridge also lacks orange on the throat. Female lacks the male's white chest band and brick-red crown and has less orange on the throat than Rufous-throated. Moves around in convoys through dense vegetation in mid- to high-altitude forests."
0,Hill Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba rupestris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpig1,"Very similar in appearance to the wild-type Rock Pigeon, this flocking species inhabits open valleys and gorges also visits towns and cities. More pale-headed than Rock Pigeon, but the key distinguishing trait is a broad white stripe across its dark tail which is visible both in flight and when perched; the wild-type Rock Pigeon has a dark-tipped gray tail with no white. Forages on the ground in large flocks; can be quite tame and accommodating towards human presence."
0,Hill Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpri2,"A large, fierce-eyed prinia with a long, oft-cocked tail. Breeding adults have a gray head, white throat and brow, brown upperparts, and pale, brown-washed underparts. Nonbreeding adults lack the gray but retain the white brow and throat. May be confused at a distance with Yellow-bellied Prinia, but is much larger, and has a more extensive brow and no bright yellow anywhere on the body. Usually found in open, scrubby habitats, including overgrown fields and forest edges. Loud, strident song consists of one high liquid-sounding note being repeated over and over."
0,Hill Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Hirundo domicola,https://ebird.org/species/pacswa3,"A small dark blue-black swallow with rufous-chestnut on its face and a short tail. Except for a black triangular eye-stripe extending to the bill, the entire forehead, chin, throat, and upper breast are rufous-chestnut, without any dark necklace like that of Barn Swallow, the main confusion species. Hill Swallow’s dark upperparts have a blue-green sheen that is only visible when seen up close, while the underparts are dingy white with ashy-gray on the flanks. Juveniles have duller chestnut on the face. Mainly inhabits open areas such as grasslands, reservoirs, and tea estates in the high hills above 500 meters of elevation; very rare at lower elevations. Often seen wheeling and looping in the air after insects, with a swift flight action reminiscent of a Barn Swallow with a shorter tail."
0,Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus pulcherrimus,https://ebird.org/species/bearos1,"A rather dark and heavily marked rosefinch. Male is dark rosy-pink below and dark, streaky brown above with a dark pink brow. Female is brown and streaky with underparts streaking extending from the throat (where the streaks are extremely fine) to the belly (where the streaks are heavier and longer). Females also have a faint pale brow, but it is weak and not always noticeable; note the far more contrasting brow of Chinese and Himalayan White-browed Rosefinches. Inhabits montane and hilly scrub, forest edges, and village outskirts. Gives twitters and trills. The extremely similar Chinese Beautiful Rosefinch gives sharper and more metallic call notes than the Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch."
0,Himalayan Bluetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Tarsiger rufilatus,https://ebird.org/species/himblu1,"Brightly-colored adult male is unmistakable in range: blazing sapphire blue with orange flanks and white throat and belly. Female is brown with a white throat, orange flanks, and pale blue rump and tail. Red-flanked Bluetail can be confusing where the two overlap in the latter’s migratory and winter range; note Himalayan’s brighter blue eyebrow and brighter, deeper blue upperparts in the male. Female is slightly more grayish than Red-flanked, but this identification can be much more difficult, and females may not be safely separable if not with male. Himalayan’s song is a simple, repeated “tcher-thcew-wee!”. Breeds in submontane forest up to the treeline; descends in the winter, often moving into edge habitats. A frequent sight along forest tracks."
0,Himalayan Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus leucogenys,https://ebird.org/species/whcbul2,"Sharp-looking bulbul with a spiffy mohawk. Note black face and throat, bright white cheek spot, and yellow vent. A species of foothill and montane forested areas; also found in brush, gardens, and towns. Tame and unafraid of people. Typically in pairs or small flocks during the breeding season; congregates in large flocks at other times. Song is a short and rather nasal-sounding burst of gurgling warbles. Calls include dry raspings, chups, and squeaks."
0,Himalayan Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo refectus,https://ebird.org/species/combuz9,"A large hawk with a confusing range and unclear identification criteria. Resident in the Himalayas and a breeder in adjacent areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A large “typical” buzzard, brown overall with blotchy patterning on the breast, dark upper “trousers,” and dark “elbows” and trailing edge on the underwing. Juvenile streakier below with a more finely barred tail and paler trailing edge. Compare with extremely similar Upland and Eastern Buzzards; note less eagle-like proportions than Upland, as well as marginally darker “trousers” and more prominent trailing edge than Eastern."
0,Himalayan Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Cuculus saturatus,https://ebird.org/species/himcuc1,"Visually indistinguishable from Oriental Cuckoo. Adult male is gray above with a black-and-white-barred belly and a dark gray tail; females usually look similar, but some (known as hepatic morph birds) have cinnamon-brown upperparts with black barring throughout. Intermediate in size between Common and Lesser Cuckoos; distinguished from both species by buffy (not white) under-tail feathers and from Lesser Cuckoos by yellow iris. Song is a series of five notes, with the leading note being sharper and more distinct than the four that follow; compare with Oriental Cuckoo’s series of mellow paired notes. Breeds in a wide range of different lowland and hill forests; also more open habitats outside of breeding season."
0,Himalayan Cutia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Cutia nipalensis,https://ebird.org/species/cutia1,"A beautiful, stocky inhabitant of high-elevation broadleaf and mixed forests. Looks like a babbler, but much more closely related to laughingthrushes. Male has a black mask, blue-gray crown, white throat, barred sides, and bright rufous back. Female is paler, with a brown face and a more yellowish back lined with black streaks. Forages at middle and upper levels, often in small groups, picking invertebrates from leaf clusters, ferns and orchids, and mossy crevices of trunks and branches. Listen for its loud song, an extended series of high-pitched, piercing “chee!” notes."
0,Himalayan Flameback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dinopium shorii,https://ebird.org/species/himfla1,"A large woodpecker with a brilliant orange back, a black stripe through the eye and cheek, and black on the back of the neck. Inhabits mature lowland forest. It looks for invertebrates in trees, meticulously working its way up from the base of the trunk. Not shy; often mixes with other species, especially babblers and laughingthrushes. Very similar to Common Flameback, but the Himalayan Flameback has a longer bill and the cheek stripe splits into two near the bill. The call is a tinny, nasal series of notes similar to those of other flamebacks."
0,Himalayan Monal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophophorus impejanus,https://ebird.org/species/himmon1,"Decked out in all the colors of the rainbow, the male is the image of iridescence; green crested head, red neck, green shoulders, blue back, orange tail, and black underparts. When displaying or flushed, flashes a bright white patch on the back. Female is nowhere near as brightly-colored, with a pale blue eye patch, white throat, and streaky brown body. Found in Himalayan hill forest, typically in areas with extensive rhododendron and bamboo-dominated understory."
0,Himalayan Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix nivicolum,https://ebird.org/species/himowl1,"A medium-sized brownish owl of montane forests, generally uncommon. Brownish overall with finely patterned underparts. Deep black eyes bracketed by bright white arcs impart a learned, severe expression. Asian counterpart to Europe's Tawny Owl. Calls loudly and slowly, a repeated pair of hoots."
0,Himalayan Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia crinigera,https://ebird.org/species/strpri2,"A rather dull-plumaged songbird of fields, grasslands, forest edges, and farmland, mostly at moderate and high elevations. Often sparsely distributed and difficult to find. Gray-brown above with a pale belly and blackish streaking on head and wings. Breeding males become black-billed and darker on the face, losing the pale eyebrow that is usually shown in other plumages. Typically found singly or in pairs, clambering about in grasses and shrubbery. Often sings from an exposed perch, giving a loud but dry, rolling series of notes, slower than the song of Striped Prinia. Visually very similar to Striped Prinia, but usually separated by range. In the area of overlap, female and non-breeding male Himalayan Prinias show weaker streaking on the back and a duller rufous panel in the wings. Breeding males are distinguished by their darker faces without an eye-stripe. Also similar to Burmese Prinia, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Himalayan Prinia is distinguished by having more streaking, especially along the sides of the breast."
0,Himalayan Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Ophrysia superciliosa,https://ebird.org/species/himqua1,"Extinct, last reported in 1876. Formerly west central Himalayas."
0,Himalayan Rubythroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/himrub1,"Shy inhabitant of thickets and dense grassy areas from subalpine scrub to above treeline. Male is gunmetal gray with a white brow, bright orange throat, and a black patch extending from the face down to the breast. Very similar to the closely related Chinese Rubythroat, which has a white moustachial stripe. Chinese Rubythroat female averages browner than female Himalayan, but is best identified by range; Chinese breeds in central and south-central China, while Himalayan breeds along the Himalayas, in Xinjiang, and in Central Asia. Female Himalayan has a weaker eyebrow than female Siberian Rubythroat, and is darker overall."
0,Himalayan Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx cruralis,https://ebird.org/species/whbsho4,"Tiny, stumpy bird of dense undergrowth. Male is dark slate-blue with broad white eyebrows that give him the appearance of a furious little old man. Female is warm pale brown all over. In areas of overlap with Chinese and Lesser Shortwings, look out for the all-dark lower belly, which is white in those species. Inhabits hill and montane forest, where it forages in dense undergrowth, frequently in proximity to streams. Song is composed of high thin whistles with short bursts of clicking chattering mixed in."
0,Himalayan Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus himalayensis,https://ebird.org/species/himsno,"A hulking game bird of rocky mountain slopes and cliffsides. Native to the Himalayas and adjacent mountain ranges, but has also been introduced in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada. Gray overall with patchy brown streaking on the breast and two dark brown lines running down the neck. Can be somewhat tame in protected areas, coming down to monasteries for food, especially during the winter."
0,Himalayan Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus brevirostris,https://ebird.org/species/himswi2,"Gray-brown swiftlet with a pale gray rump and a squared-off tail. The westernmost ranging species in the genus and the only member throughout much of its range. Smaller than most other swifts in range except for House Swift, which is black overall with a sharp white rump and throat. Tends to travel in small to medium-sized flocks, often swooping low over bodies of water. Builds dark bowl-shaped nests in closely-clustered colonies under rocky overhangs, in caves, and in old buildings. Gives clicking calls and twitters, especially when near colonies."
0,Himalayan Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera salimalii,https://ebird.org/species/himthr1,"A mysterious and range-restricted thrush the color of rich caramel. Dark brown above with densely black-scaled underparts, white eye-ring, and uniform upperparts. Extremely similar to Sichuan and Alpine Thrushes; averages darker above, heavier-billed, and stockier-looking. Breeds in eastern Himalayan forests at around 3000-4000 meters; winters down to around 1450 meters. Gives a typical ringing, melodic thrush song."
0,Himalayan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos himalayensis,https://ebird.org/species/himwoo1,"A relatively large woodpecker with a black back, a white patch on the shoulders, and white spots on the flight feathers. A distinctive black stripe runs around the ears to the base of the bill. The top of the male’s head is red, while the female’s is black. Usually solitary or in pairs, searching for invertebrates along the trunks of trees in oak, pine, and mixed forests. Calls include metallic grating notes, a single-noted “chuck,” and short, rapid rolls of drumming."
0,Hinde's Pied-Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides hindei,https://ebird.org/species/hipbab1,"A dark babbler with abundant scaly markings and red-orange eyes. The exact pattern and coloration are extremely variable. The underparts can be mostly black with white scaling, or mostly white with dark scaling. There is often rufous on the rump and undertail, and sometimes elsewhere. Found very locally at middle elevations in central Kenya, in thickets, remnant natural forest, and scrub dominated by exotic species. Almost always in small groups, which feed by hopping across the ground. Easily separated from other babblers in its range by the abundant and variable scaling. Usually located by the raspy babbling call, typically given by a whole group in chorus."
0,Hispaniolan Crossbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxia megaplaga,https://ebird.org/species/hiscro,"A gregarious species of montane pine forests. This species can be deceptively hard to find when not calling, despite its bright colors and tendency to travel in flocks of up to twenty. Note that the namesake crossed bill can be hard to see. Males are clothed in red and bear bright white wingbars. The dull yellow-olive female can be separated from other species by its bold white wingbars and structure: the bill is stout and the tail is short and notched. Call is loud “djit, djit.” Its song is a soft series of warblings and trills."
0,Hispaniolan Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Riccordia swainsonii,https://ebird.org/species/hiseme1,"An inhabitant of moist montane woodlands including coffee plantations. The long-tailed male is distinctively entirely iridescent green and the base of the bill is red. The female is metallic green above, dingy white below, and has a relatively long, forked tail. The Antillean Mango is shorter tailed (wings just about even with tail tip when perched) and has a distinctly down-curved bill. The Vervain Hummingbird is much smaller and shorter billed than the Hispaniolan Emerald. Most common vocalization is a sharp “tic,” most often given in a prolonged series at about five “tics” per second."
0,Hispaniolan Lizard-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus longirostris,https://ebird.org/species/hislic1,"An impressive long-tailed species of wooded habitats including shade coffee plantations. Typically found foraging in dense vegetation from understory to canopy; can be found sunning in the open at first light with its tail spread. Note this species long straight narrow bill, brilliant red eyering, gray chest, and buff-orange belly. The Bay-breasted Cuckoo is similarly shaped but is larger with a maroon chest and short curved bill. The Mangrove Cuckoo is smaller with a smaller curved bill and a black mask. Secretive, but not shy, this species is often first detected by its voice: a long, rapid, ratcheting “keh-keh-keh…” Also gives a low “craaa” and a sharp “chek.”"
0,Hispaniolan Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/graori1,"A sleek forest bird that sometimes ventures into gardens and parks in search of flowers and fruit; prefers areas with palms. The adult is distinctive—clothed in black except for patches of yellow on lower belly, shoulders, and rump. No similar species occur within its range. Immatures are muddled yellow, orange, and olive, developing adult plumage over the course of a year. This plumage resembles that of female and young Baltimore Orioles, a scarce migrant and winter visitor to Hispaniola. Similarly attired Baltimore Orioles can be distinguished by their orange underparts and white wingbars. The song is a rapid jumble of squeaky and metallic notes. Calls include a buzzy “jrrrt” and a metallic “zhwee.”"
0,Hispaniolan Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacara chloropterus,https://ebird.org/species/hispar,"A sleek, medium-large, gregarious species of woodlands that sometimes ventures into agricultural and urban areas. Its overall green plumage, long, pointed tail, and stout bill eliminate all other species in range. In overflight, it often appears green with a red slash on each forewing. Most common call is a series of squeaks that takes on a twittering quality when given by an excited flock."
0,Hispaniolan Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus hispaniolensis,https://ebird.org/species/hispew1,"A small drab inhabitant of woodlands including orchards and coffee plantations; typically “flycatches” from a low perch and returns to the same perch. This species is perhaps most notable in its lack of field marks, including lack of wingbars and facial markings. The Stolid Flycatcher is much larger and has wingbars and the Greater Antillean Elaenia has bold wingbars and a dull eyering. Rather unvocal for a pewee; most common call is a repeated mellow “pip”."
0,Hispaniolan Spindalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Spindalidae,Spindalis dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/hisspi,"A somewhat small woodland bird that moves rather deliberately as it feeds on fruits and flowers and the occasional insect. Occupies wide range of forests from pines to mangroves. Brilliant male looks like a sunrise with a black-and-white head; no truly similar species on Hispaniola. Females head pattern is a dull version of the males, but note streaking below. Calls are a high and thin single “tsee” or rapid “tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi.”"
0,Hispaniolan Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Priotelus roseigaster,https://ebird.org/species/histro1,"This strikingly colored denizen of montane woodlands (and less often, mangrove swamps) is rather sedate. It is often found sitting upright and rather motionless, typically in paris. One's first impression is often of a rather long and largish bird with a brilliant red belly, emerald back, and blackish head. No similar species occur within its range. Song is a tremulous “whut-will,” with second note longer and trailing off at end. The first note is sometimes omitted and second note is sometimes given as doublet or triplet. Calls include a shrill “whee” and soft coos. Though rather vocal, calling birds are difficult to locate due ventriloquial quality of their vocalizations."
0,Hispaniolan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes striatus,https://ebird.org/species/hiswoo1,"A noisy and gregarious woodpecker that inhabits most wooded habitats. It is a striking species with a bold yellow-and-black barred back, a red crown, and a gray face with staring yellow eye. In flight, note the bright red rump. No similar species occur in its range. Vocalizations include a squeaky ""wick, wick, wick, wick…"", a sputtering ""du-du-du-du-du..."", and a squeaky, sometimes drawn out, whinny."
0,Hoary Puffleg,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Haplophaedia lugens,https://ebird.org/species/hoapuf1,"Dull hummingbird restricted to mid-elevation Andean cloud forest in northwestern Ecuador and western Colombia. Mostly green, but underparts are grayer with white scaling; also note coppery tinge to crown and rump. White leg puffs are usually conspicuous on male, but they are much smaller on female and immature and can be concealed behind belly feathers. Scarce; usually encountered feeding low inside forest, often near streams."
0,Hoatzin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Opisthocomiformes,Opisthocomidae,Opisthocomus hoazin,https://ebird.org/species/hoatzi1,"Large, dumpy bird found around lake edges and slow-moving streams. Head looks too small for its large brown body. Its orange mohawk, blue facial skin, and stubby bill make this bird extremely distinctive. Usually found in groups or pairs. Moves clumsily around waterside vegetation, making loud huffing noises."
0,Hodgson's Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/hodfro1,"Cryptic, uncommon nightbird of evergreen and mixed foothill and montane forests (900-2000 meters). Both sexes have dappled lichen-like plumage, the male grayish, female rusty brown. Silent birds are best distinguished from other small frogmouths by range, habitat, elevation, and bird’s comparatively small size. Song a long, haunting whistle, given repeatedly in series."
0,Hodgson's Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Phoenicurus hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/hodred1,"Male very similar in appearance to Daurian Redstart; note more restricted silver on the forehead and less distinct wing panel. Female’s lack of a white wing patch distinguishes her from female Daurian, and she averages paler than female Black Redstart, with a brighter eye-ring. Blue-fronted Redstart female can be similar; Hodgson’s female is colder-toned with a single dark stripe down the tail instead of Blue-fronted’s inverted “T.” Hodgson’s breeds in hilly and montane open forests and forest edge; descends in the winter, favoring scrubby edge."
0,Hoffmanns's Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Dendrocolaptes hoffmannsi,https://ebird.org/species/hofwoo2,"Large woodcreeper with a strong black bill. Dark chestnut-brown overall. Note the very fine bars on the head and underparts and the cinnamon crown. Found in the interior of humid forest and second growth, sometimes venturing to the forest edges, and regularly attending army-ant swarms. The song is a rolling series of “wutwutwut…” notes like the song of the closely-related Black-banded Woodcreeper, but the two probably don’t overlap in range. The similar Amazonian Barred-Woodcreeper has a dark red-brown bill."
0,Holub's Golden-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus xanthops,https://ebird.org/species/hogwea1,"Large weaver with a heavy black bill and pale eyes. Juveniles dull, with brown eyes; they can be identified by their overall structure and tendency to associate with more distinctive adults. Found in savanna, woodland, scrub, and cultivation. Usually nests near water. Vocalizations are typical of weavers, “chek” notes and a sizzling “radio static” song, though somewhat lower-pitched. Other golden-weavers are smaller and don’t have pale eyes."
0,Honduran Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia luciae,https://ebird.org/species/honeme1,"Fairly small hummingbird with very limited range in dry valleys of Honduras.

0,Honeyguide Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Baeopogon indicator,https://ebird.org/species/hongre1,"Unusual dark greenbul with upright posture that does strongly resemble a honeyguide. Males have a white eye and females a dark one. Both sexes show a large white patch in the outer tail. Found in the upper portions of lowland forest. Usually in pairs or small groups. Most often detected by call: a slow series of mewing whistles. Similar to Sjöstedt's Greenbul, but has darker gray underparts, and male further distinguished by its pale eye. Distinguished from honeyguides by its different shape, especially the longer tail. Flight is direct, unlike undulating flight of a honeyguide."
0,Hooded Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaricula cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/hooant1,"Rare antpitta known only from a few scattered sites. Small and quite distinctive with a chestnut hood and yellow bill contrasting with its otherwise brown and gray plumage. Inhabits cloud forest understory, and unlike most larger antpittas, it spends very little time on the ground, typically perching about three to six feet up. Typical vocalization is a shrill, high-pitched whistle given once every five to ten seconds."
0,Hooded Berryeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Carpornis cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/hoober2,"Big and chunky rainforest cotinga with a long tail. Found in the canopy of montane forests where it can be locally common, but hard to see. Striking plumage with a black head, yellow collar and belly, and a chestnut back with black and yellow edging to the wings. The iris is dark brown. Females are similar but duller. The song is a distinctive and far-carrying explosive whistled “wreep-wrepoo.”"
0,Hooded Butcherbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Artamidae,Cracticus cassicus,https://ebird.org/species/hoobut1,"A large, pied bird of lowland and foothill secondary forest and edges. Note the distinctive black hood extending to the chest, Also black back, edge to the wing and end of the tail. The rest of the plumage is white. Long, silvery bill with black tip.

0,Hooded Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus cornix,https://ebird.org/species/hoocro1,"Common in varied open and semiopen habitats from towns and farmland to open woodland and moorland; replaced to south and west by Carrion Crow. Found in pairs or small groups, not usually in large flocks except at roosts. Unless seen in poor light or at a distance, plumage is distinctive, with ashy gray body, contrasting black head, wings, and tail. With distant flying birds, note that ravens soar and glide readily, whereas crows typically just flap along."
0,Hooded Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina longicauda,https://ebird.org/species/hoocus1,"A large, fairly long-tailed bird of montane forest canopy. Pale gray plumage with black flight feathers and tail. Male has a full black hood and upper chest, while the female has just a black face and throat. Similar to Black-faced Cuckooshrike but should be separated by habitat and elevation. Voice, repeated, loud, downslurred, grating calls “gerrr! gerrr! gerrr!” somewhat reminiscent of a Blue Jay."

0,Hooded Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps gallardoi,https://ebird.org/species/hoogre1,"A beautiful, small grebe of Patagonia that is rare, local, and declining; breeds on a few interior lakes. Nonbreeding birds range to coastal waters and lowland lakes, where they are most often seen in the company of Silvery Grebes. Told from Silvery Grebe by more contrasting head pattern: black hood contrasts with white forehead and golden tiara, often striking at long range. Grebes are very rarely seen in flight, but wings of Hooded are mostly white unlike the dark wings with a white hind patch seen on Silvery Grebe."
0,Hooded Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Coccothraustes abeillei,https://ebird.org/species/hoogro1,"Handsome, chunky finch of humid evergreen and pine-evergreen forest in foothills and highlands.
