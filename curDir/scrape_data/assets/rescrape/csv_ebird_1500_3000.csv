0,Bluethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Luscinia svecica,https://ebird.org/species/blueth,"Beautiful thrush-like bird that tends to stay hidden. Dull gray above, but a head-on view reveals a stunning pattern of electric blue and orange on the throat (some variation in pattern across range). Females show fainter colors than males, sometimes lacking blue entirely, but are still very boldly patterned. On the dullest young females, look for bold white eyebrow and throat, necklace of dark streaks, and rufous on the base of the tail. Variable song includes imitations of other species among a jumble of trills, whistles, and chirps. Typically found in scrubby, brushy habitat, often in edge areas: reedbeds, overgrown fields, and thickets. Usually skulky but singing males can perch conspicuously atop a bush. Breeds across Europe and Asia into Alaska; winters from northern Africa to southeast Asia."
0,Bluish Flowerpiercer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/bluflo1,"Dull blue-gray flowerpiercer found in the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia. Dark reddish eye. Could be confused with Masked Flowerpiercer but duller overall without large black mask. Bill is less upswept than most flowerpiercers. Found singly or in pairs, often following a mixed-species flock through the forest canopy. Occurs from around 1,600-2,700m."
0,Blyth's Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus affinis,https://ebird.org/species/javfro2,"Cryptic, uncommon nightbird of lowland and lower foothill forests (to 800 meters). Males show extensive barring on wings, whitish lower belly, and irregular white blotches on the breast. Females are warmer brown, almost rufous, with less wing barring and a wide “necklace” of white blotches on the breast. The only frogmouth in much of its western range. Vocalizations vary; male gives a series of rippling clear whistles and both sexes give harsh nasal croaks."
0,Blyth's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Rhyticeros plicatus,https://ebird.org/species/blyhor1,"A huge, spectacular hornbill of lowland and foothill forest. All black body and white tail. Blue skin on the pouch below the bill and around the eye. Male is much larger with a rufous head and chest, whereas the female has a black head. A large, ivory-colored bill with a rippled casque on top. Presence often betrayed by loud wingbeats overhead. Forages in the canopy for fruit and sometimes, small animal prey. Unmistakable. The only hornbill in its range. Voice, far-carrying, gruff barks, or grunts “gew! gew! gew!”."
0,Blyth's Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Alcedo hercules,https://ebird.org/species/blykin1,"Medium-sized kingfisher of shaded mountain streams in mature hill forest. Like a larger version of Common Kingfisher, but much darker and with no orange behind the ear. Bill is heavy and all-dark; its length and girth give the bird a heavy-headed appearance. Perches low over the water on boulders and low-hanging branches, from which it gives a hoarse, rasping call."
0,Blyth's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus reguloides,https://ebird.org/species/blylew1,"Fairly bright mid-sized leaf-warbler, yellowish-green above and white below with two wingbars, a broad yellow-suffused eyebrow, and a pale stripe across a gray crown. Amount of white in the tail is intermediate between White-tailed Leaf-Warbler and Emei Leaf-Warbler. A brighter crown stripe separates Blyth’s from the Emei, and unique behavior serves to distinguish this species from White-tailed: Blyth’s constantly flicks wings one after the other, while White-tailed flicks them simultaneously. Kloss’s Leaf-Warbler is much brighter overall, especially on the head and vent. Hartert’s and Claudia’s Leaf-Warblers are closely related, physically similar, and may pose issues in areas of overlap: look out for a more yellowish breast on Hartert’s and a whiter eyebrow and less white in the tail in Claudia’s. Blyth’s song is a high “tsi-tsslehlee-tsslehlee” or “tsi-tchew-witty-tchew-witty-tchew,” with the introductory note separating it from Hartert’s but not always Claudia’s. Breeds in broadleaf (often oak), coniferous, or mixed forests at middle to high elevations, and descends into lower foothill regions in the winter."
0,Blyth's Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone affinis,https://ebird.org/species/blypaf1,"Breeding males trail long streamers which are almost double the length of the body. Male comes in rufous and white morphs; both morphs have dark head, weak triangular crest, and blue eyering. Females resemble a non-breeding rufous male, but with a duller blue eyering and slightly paler head. Extremely similar to Amur Paradise-Flycatcher, but has a glossier black head with a clearer demarcation between the black and gray. Female is similar to female Japanese Paradise-Flycatcher, but with a much paler gray breast which fades more gradually (as opposed to sharper cutoff between gray breast and white belly of Japanese). Inhabits evergreen broadleaf forest and forest edge, including secondary growth, gardens, and plantations, in lowlands and foothills. Some populations are migratory. Song is a ringing “wiwiwiwiwiwiwi;” call is a nasal, rising “wee-weh.”"
0,Blyth's Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus godlewskii,https://ebird.org/species/blypip1,"A mid-sized pipit with pale brown plumage and a fine, dark bill. Strong streaking on the head, mantle, and back contrasts strongly with the pale edges of the feathers. The face appears clean and the eyebrow appears to start behind the eye. The wings show distinct white bars and there are fine streaks on the breast. Extremely similar to Paddyfield and Richard’s Pipits, but slightly bigger than the former and smaller than the latter, and paler and more contrasting overall than either of them. Inhabits grassy fields. The song is a series of short, raspy notes. The call is a sharp, explosive “shpeeu,” sometimes followed by single-syllabled “chup” notes."
0,Blyth's Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus dumetorum,https://ebird.org/species/blrwar1,"Field identification challenging. Pay attention to short wings (short primary projection), gray-brown tones to upperparts and long, dark-tipped bill with a flat forehead. Song is varied with many repetitions and lots of mimicry; call is a high-pitched and loud ""tek."" Found in forest edges, bushes, marsh edges, and parks, but not particularly associated with water. Usually sings from bushes and trees, not in reeds or herbage."
0,Blyth's Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus grandis,https://ebird.org/species/blyros1,"A relatively large rosefinch with a heavy, pale bill. The male has a mottled-pink eyebrow and cheeks and dull pink underparts. The female is brownish overall with strong streaking and a pale, lightly streaked supercilium. Best told apart from other similar rosefinches by the combination of large size, large bill, and relatively short wings and tail. Feeds on the ground. Found in high montane regions in conifer forests, or above treeline. In winter, descends to gardens and groves."
0,Blyth's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus leuconyx,https://ebird.org/species/blyswi1,"A large swift with long pointed wings and a long, deeply forked tail. It has black upperparts, tail, and wings, with a prominent white rump. Feathers of underparts broadly fringed with dirty white, and throat is whitish. Often difficult or nearly impossible to separate in the field from other similar “fork-tailed swifts,” but the white rump band is slightly thinner than that of Pacific Swift, while Salim Ali’s Swift has a slightly differently shaped white throat patch. This species is less blackish than Cook’s Swift, with a slightly wider rump band. Mostly sticks to hills while breeding, but disperses widely post-breeding and large flocks or loose individuals can be seen almost anywhere."
0,Blyth's Tragopan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tragopan blythii,https://ebird.org/species/blytra1,"A large pheasant-like bird with a short tail. Male has a yellow face, gray upperparts with white spots, a bright red breast and back of the head, and a white band on the base of the tail. Female is brown throughout, with uniform pale speckling and an indistinct pale eye-ring. Occurs in dense evergreen montane forests, where it feeds in the undergrowth. The song is a loud, wailing “oooaaahh.”"
0,Bobolink,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Dolichonyx oryzivorus,https://ebird.org/species/boboli,"Breeding male is distinctive with black body, white rump, and creamy nape. Females and nonbreeders are drastically different, yellow-brown with fine streaking on breast sides, and stripes on head. Smaller than Red-winged Blackbird with shorter bill. Spiky tail feathers. In the blackbird family, although often mistaken as a sparrow. Breeds in open fields. Listen for male's bubbly song. Often in flocks during fall migration; departs early for wintering grounds in South America."
0,Bocage's Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia bocagei,https://ebird.org/species/bocaka1,"Small, fairly plain, brown-and-orange robin-like bird. The tail is uniformly rufous-brown and the face is mostly orange. Found in the understory of forest at middle and high elevations. Shy and inconspicuous. The song is a quiet, up-and-down series of several mournful whistles. Very similar to Lowland Akalat, but has orange extending further onto the face, and found at higher elevations. Also similar to White-bellied and Gray-winged Robin-Chats, but separated from the former by uniform tail, and from the latter by the lack of a strong white eyebrow."
0,Bocage's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Nectarinia bocagii,https://ebird.org/species/bocsun2,"A slim, medium-sized sunbird with a long thin bill. Males have purple iridescence, though they look black in most light. The female is very drab. Found locally in open microhabitats within miombo woodland, including grassy glades and wetland edges. Similar to Bronze Sunbird, but male separated by the purple rather than green iridescence, and female by the lack of a strong eyebrow or streaking below. Female similar to other female sunbirds, but can be identified with care by a combination of its plainness and its overall size and structure. Vocalizations not well known, but one common call is two whistled notes given in quick succession."
0,Bocage's Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus temporalis,https://ebird.org/species/bocwea1,"A fairly large weaver with a long thin pointed bill. The male has a pale eye, and during the breeding season a brownish wash to the ear. Non-breeding males and females are dull, with olive-green upperparts and paler underparts. Found locally in areas with a mix of trees, bushes, and abundant grassy ground cover. Nests adjacent water. Gives a typical weaver chattering and rasping song, and a “chek” call. Breeding males are distinctive, and other plumages can be identified with caution by a combination of their size, long and thin bill, and the pale eyes of the males."
0,Bohemian Waxwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Bombycillidae,Bombycilla garrulus,https://ebird.org/species/bohwax,"Plump, smooth-plumaged bird with a sleek crest and white and yellow markings on wings. Mostly clean gray with brighter rusty wash on the face. Look for rich rufous undertail. Breeds in open coniferous forests at high latitudes across the Northern Hemisphere. Winter range depends on fruit crops; sometimes descends much further south in large numbers. Often found in flocks feasting on fruiting trees like crabapple and mountain ash. Listen for their ringing trills, often given while flying overhead. Compare with Cedar Waxwing in North America; Bohemian is larger and grayer, with rufous undertail and different wing pattern."
0,Bohol Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga decorosa,https://ebird.org/species/bohsun1,"A small bird of lowland forest on the island of Bohol. Has a fairly long and curved bill, yellow underparts, olive upperparts, a metallic green tail, and a reddish eye. Male has purplish blue iridescence on the forehead and cheek, a metallic green wing, and an orange smudge on the upper chest. Female has a whitish throat and faint streaking on the chest. Male is distinctive in range. Female is similar to female Handsome Sunbird, but slightly larger with a longer, thicker bill. Voice includes a rough, nasal “rehk!”"
0,Bokmakierie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Telophorus zeylonus,https://ebird.org/species/bokmak1,"A large, sturdy olive-gray and yellow bushshrike with a distinctive black chest band that arcs up to the bill base, forming a broad necklace. In flight the dark tail has striking yellow tips. The juvenile is dull and lacks the chest band. Pairs are bold in shrubby and open country, where they forage low in bushes or grass clumps, hopping on open ground or running between clumps looking for invertebrates. The species has a varied and complex repertoire of songs and calls, the most characteristic of which is a duetted onomatopoeic “bok-mak-ie-rie,” often delivered from a conspicuous perch."
0,Bolivian Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Oreopsar bolivianus,https://ebird.org/species/bolbla1,"Large, brown-winged blackbird of dry valleys in the high Andes of central and northern Bolivia. Prefers sparsely vegetated areas, such as Polylepis woodland, agricultural areas, towns, cactus forest, and scrublands. Brown wings are distinctive, but note that second-year blackbirds of other species (Chopi Blackbird, Shiny Cowbird) can show contrastingly brown retained juvenile wing feathers. Generally forages singly or in small groups, and sings from exposed perches. Song a simple, repeated two-part “pe-chew” given 3-8 times."
0,Bolivian Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Atlapetes rufinucha,https://ebird.org/species/rnbfin1,"Common, striking brushfinch of the understory of humid montane forest in the middle and upper elevation of the eastern slope of the Andes in central and Northern Bolivia. Travels in pairs and family groups, often with mixed-species flocks. Distinctive in range – replaced to the north by Black-faced Brushfinch, to the south (at the main bend in the Andes) by Fulvous-headed Brushfinch."
0,Bolivian Earthcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Tarphonomus harterti,https://ebird.org/species/bolear1,"Medium-sized brown bird of the ground and understory of thorn forest in Bolivia’s lower interandean valleys, though occurs locally at higher elevations. In most of range, the only earthcreeper. Prefers dense understory more than other species of earthcreeper. More often heard than seen, but not hard to find once the dry staccato song is learned."
0,Bolivian Recurvebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Syndactyla striata,https://ebird.org/species/bolrec1,"Unique foliage-gleaner of dense bamboo in humid montane forest from low to mid elevations in the east slopes of the Andes. Despite its name, the bill is only very slightly recurved. Most easily found by its long, dry song. Generally in primary forest, far from human settlement, singly or in pairs. Tends to stay on small territories for long periods. From other foliage gleaners by rufous throat and supercilium, even streaking below, and straight culmen. Song a long series of accelerating but slightly sputtering dry “cak” notes."
0,Bolivian Slaty-Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus sticturus,https://ebird.org/species/bolsla1,"Small antshrike. Males are mostly gray, with a black crown and white-spotted black wings and tail. Females are mostly rusty-colored, with whitish underparts. Note the pale eyes, which help to differentiate this species from similar slaty-antshrikes. Found in semideciduous forests with dense vine tangles and adjacent second growth. Forages from the understory to middle levels and apparently does not accompany mixed-species flocks. The song is a series of nasal notes ending with a rattle."
0,Bolivian Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cranioleuca henricae,https://ebird.org/species/bolspi1,"Large arboreal spinetail restricted to the upper Cotacajes river valley in NW Bolivia, where primarily known from the Inquisivi area in open woodland near treeline. From the similar Ash-browed Spinetail by whitish breast and pale nape. Song a very high, accelerating series of about 20 squeaks given over ~1.5 seconds that drops slightly in pitch over the course of the song."
0,Bolivian Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Zimmerius bolivianus,https://ebird.org/species/boltyr1,"Small, pale olive-gray flycatcher. Found across a wide elevational range from montane forest all the way up to elfin forest and scrub around the treeline. Perches horizontally, holding its head up; has a pale eye and lacks wingbars. Very pale belly helps distinguish it from the similar Red-billed Tyrannulet, which has a yellow belly and which overlaps with Bolivian at the lower part of Bolivian’s elevational range. Bolivian’s call is a single, descending whistle."
0,Bolivian Warbling Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Poospiza boliviana,https://ebird.org/species/bowfin1,"Striking tanager of open woodland and scrub in high elevations of the east slope of the Andes in central and southern Bolivia and extreme NW Argentina; including agricultural lands, and open Polylepis woodland. From Black-and-chestnut Warbling-Finch by white throat and paler underparts in Bolivian. Rufous band across breast distinguishes it from the similar, but gray-breasted Rufous-sided Warbling-Finch."
0,Bolle's Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba bollii,https://ebird.org/species/bolpig1,"Endemic to the Canary Islands where it is found in laurel and tree heath forests on mountain slopes. Shy and difficult to observe unless flushed. Plumage is largely grey with a purple-pink breast band. Smaller than co-occurring Laurel Pigeon from which it differs in having contrasting wings with dark flight feathers, a dark tail with a grey band and yellowish eyes."
0,Bonaparte's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Chroicocephalus philadelphia,https://ebird.org/species/bongul,"The most common small gull through most of North America, especially inland. Breeding adults have a black head, thin white eye arcs, bright red legs, light gray upperparts, and black wingtips. Note distinctive wing pattern on adults in flight: white wedge on the leading edge of the wing, with small black tips on the outer wing feathers. Nonbreeding adults and immatures have pinkish legs and a mostly white head with black ear spot. Immatures are more heavily marked with brown and black on the wings. Breeds near water in boreal forest; the only gull that makes a stick nest in a tree. Often seen in large flocks along beaches, bays, coves, and lakes during migration and winter. Feeds on small fish and invertebrates, often gracefully fluttering around and picking them off the water surface."
0,Bonaparte's Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgus concretus,https://ebird.org/species/bonnig1,"Small dark-brown nightjar of lowland forests. Bright white bib often noticeable. Male has silvery-white tips to the outer tail feathers; both sexes lack white in the wings. Nocturnal and extremely rarely encountered by day, when it roosts in thick, tangled foliage. Frequently hawks from a perch. Listen for its strange, mooing moan: “wuoOOOhwwhh”."
0,Bonaparte's Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Pyrrhura lucianii,https://ebird.org/species/bonpar1,"Long-tailed parakeet with a dark brown head, pale cheeks, and a scalloped breast. Note the lack of red on the shoulders and the blue forehead. Found in humid forests, where most often encountered in groups flying noisily through the subcanopy or feeding quietly. Often seen at clay licks."
0,Bonelli's Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Aquila fasciata,https://ebird.org/species/boneag2,"Medium-sized, athletically proportioned eagle, with a whitish body contrasting with dark wings and tail. Juveniles have a rufous rather than pale body and lack the adult’s broad dark band at the tip of the tail. Found in forests or mountains, sometimes in more open habitats in winter, but usually in remote areas. Builds nests in cliffs, ledges, or caves. Distinctive in flight: note bulging secondaries, and narrow wing where it meets the body. Usually seen soaring over distant ridgelines, when the shallow fingers to its wings are obvious in contrast to the deep fingers of other eagles."
0,Bonin Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus ferreorostris,https://ebird.org/species/bongro1,"Extinct, last reported in 1900."
0,Bonin Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma hypoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/bonpet,"Medium-sized, long-tailed graceful seabird, breeding on outer islands of Japan. Grayish above, whitish below, with blackish “M” pattern in upperwing, blackish cap or cowl, and bold black bars in white underwing that form a unique pattern (with extensive black in the primaries). Black-winged Petrel has much narrower black bars in underwing and blackish trailing edge to upperwing. Plumage may also resemble much larger Hawaiian Petrel, but Hawaiian has darker crown and narrower black bars in underwing."
0,Bonin Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera terrestris,https://ebird.org/species/bonthr2,"Extinct, last reported in 1889."
0,Booted Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Hieraaetus pennatus,https://ebird.org/species/booeag1,"A medium-sized buzzard-like raptor but still unmistakably eagle-shaped, with long fingered primary flight feathers, a long square-shaped tail, and feathered legs (boots) prominent when perched. Two color morphs: pale morphs are distinctively two-toned and contrasting, whereas dark birds can be confused with Black Kites and Marsh Harriers. Look for distinctive pale ""landing lights"" on the shoulders when viewed head-on. Found in forested country with open patches, often in hilly areas where it frequently soars with wings slightly pushed forward."
0,Booted Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Iduna caligata,https://ebird.org/species/boowar1,"Small, recalling a beige chiffchaff or other Phylloscopus warbler. Rather nondescript: gray brown above, paler below, with a short, dark-tipped bill and conspicuous pale eyebrow. Pot-bellied with short wings and a square-tipped tail. Can be extremely difficult to identify; compare carefully with small Acrocephalus warblers and other Iduna warblers, especially Sykes’s Warbler. Found in low bushes in steppes and meadows; also bushy areas in migration and in winter. Usually forages low down, and occasionally on the ground. Song starts out with a few dry chitters, then launches into a rapidfire burst of high-pitched chattering that almost stumbles over itself. Also gives dry “tchak” and rattle calls."
0,Boran Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola bodessa,https://ebird.org/species/borcis1,"A large, long-tailed, streak-backed upland cisticola. Note the pale tips to the tail and the brown cap. Generally scarce and highly localized. Found in woodland and scrub on rocky hillsides. Extremely similar in appearance to Rattling Cisticola, and best distinguished by song, but also separated by the unstreaked brown cap and less distinct streaking on the back. Also similar to Ashy Cisticola, but richer brown overall, with an unstreaked cap. The calls are “chit” and “pit-dit” notes, which usually precede the song: a quick descending series of scratchy notes, similar to the song of Ashy Cisticola, but shorter, faster, and with less variation in pitch."
0,Boreal Chickadee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile hudsonicus,https://ebird.org/species/borchi2,"Restricted to coniferous forests in the far northern U.S. and Canada. Similar in size and shape to other chickadees, but with unique color pattern: brown cap, black throat, and rich orange-buff flanks. Typically fairly shy; can be difficult to get a good view as it sneaks through the dense spruces. Voice sounds like a wheezy Black-capped Chickadee; slower with more slurred notes."
0,Boreal Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Aegolius funereus,https://ebird.org/species/borowl,"Rare and seldom seen, this is the slightly larger and more northerly cousin of the Northern Saw-whet Owl. Distinguished from Northern Saw-whet by its colder gray-brown coloration and spotted (not streaked) forehead. Small size and boldly spotted body separate it from other owls. Fast tooting call is similar to a displaying Wilson's Snipe but with a clearer whistled tone and steadier volume. Difficult to find without a lot of effort; most often seen during ""irruption"" winters when large numbers move south in search of prey. Even then, requires intense searching of conifer groves to find a roosting bird during the daytime. Sometimes hunts small rodents around birdfeeders. Nests in tree cavities in forests with spruce, fir, aspen, and poplar."
0,Bornean Banded-Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Hydrornis schwaneri,https://ebird.org/species/banpit4,"Snappy-looking pitta with a broad egg-yolk-yellow eyebrow, black mask, coffee-brown back, and finely barred underparts. Male has a yellow throat, black crown, and indigo belly patch. Female is similar but duller, with no indigo belly patch, a whitish throat, paler underparts, and a pale brown crown. Listen for its song, a series of well-spaced explosive but mellow “byow!”s. Widely distributed but uncommon to locally common; inhabits hill and lowland dipterocarp forests, where it seems to favor dry ridges, hilltops, and limestone areas."
0,Bornean Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Megalaimidae,Psilopogon eximius,https://ebird.org/species/borbar1,"Small, stout barbet of Borneo’s wet foothill and montane forest. Like most other barbets, sluggish and difficult to spot in the canopy. Listen for its song, a rapidfire series of hollow clucking notes that sounds distinctly unbirdlike. If seen well, note its short dark bill, bright yellow face spot, black throat, and red-and-black crown; this combination of features separates it from all other barbets in its habitat."
0,Bornean Bristlehead,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pityriasidae,Pityriasis gymnocephala,https://ebird.org/species/borbri1,"A “grail bird” of many birders visiting Borneo, this unique and unmistakable bird with an incandescent head looks like a cross between a small crow and a brightly-colored tube sock. Dark and heavy hooked bill gives it a top-heavy appearance. Often encountered in small flocks as it hops about in the canopy of primary dipterocarp and peatswamp forest in lowland and foothill areas. Vocal, frequently giving bursts of chattering notes, as well as nasal whines and whistles."
0,Bornean Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Rubigula montis,https://ebird.org/species/bkcbul4,"Attractive and distinctive bulbul. Olive-yellow back, bright yellow throat and underparts, and black head with upright crest. A species of hill and submontane forests and forest edge; restricted to northern and central Borneo. Often encountered in degraded or regenerating forest. Commonly perches out in fairly open areas. Gives short series of bright “jyep” notes."
0,Bornean Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus mixtus,https://ebird.org/species/shtfro2,"Small stout frogmouth with a face full of wispy whiskers. Males are dark brown overall; females are bright rufous. Restricted to Borneo’s central and southern mountain ranges, where it inhabits foothill and lower montane forest. Similarly-sized Sunda Frogmouth mostly found in lowland forest. Blyth’s Frogmouth is proportionally longer-tailed, with stronger white markings on the wings and underparts. Vocalizations vary and are poorly understood; frequently gives a mournful descending whistle and a fluid, rippling, downslurred trill."
0,Bornean Green-Magpie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Cissa jefferyi,https://ebird.org/species/borgrm1,"Incredibly beautiful; grass-green with black mask, wine-red wings, and pale tertials. Unlike Common Green-Magpie, Bornean has pale eyes and lacks white-tipped dark tertials. Endemic to Borneo’s central mountains, where it can be found in montane forest up to the treeline. Forages in dense vegetation at all forest levels. Song varies but usually consists of a halting series of bright whistled notes."
0,Bornean Ground-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Carpococcyx radiceus,https://ebird.org/species/bogcuc1,"Secretive pheasant-like cuckoo that is more often heard than seen; listen for its dove-like “coo-KOO” song and odd sneeze-like call. Beautiful if seen well: iridescent purple-green wings, long dark tail, finely barred underparts, black head, and pale blue-green face and bill. Forages on the ground, often following ant swarms or Bornean bearded pigs as they flush out potential prey. Favors pristine lowland rainforests, particularly in riverine or swampy areas."
0,Bornean Leafbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chloropseidae,Chloropsis kinabaluensis,https://ebird.org/species/borlea1,"Accurately-named leaf-green canopy-dweller of Borneo’s central montane forests. Male has a black throat with a blue center and lemon-yellow outline. Female similar, but throat is all-dark, with no blue or yellow on the head. Both sexes have sky-blue flight feathers. Very similar to male Blue-winged Leafbird (the female of which lacks a black throat); look for Bornean’s green crown, yellow bib, paler blue wings, and more yellow-washed underparts. Gives a high thin “tseep” and a whistled “wee-chup!”, among other calls."
0,Bornean Spiderhunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Arachnothera everetti,https://ebird.org/species/borspi1,"Medium-sized spiderhunter with an olive back and streaked gray underparts. Inhabits lowland and submontane forests and forest edges, where it feeds primarily on nectar in the understory; favors blossoms of banana and ginger. Very similar in appearance to Gray-breasted Spiderhunter; range overlap is poorly understood but appears to be minimal. Look for Bornean’s more intensely streaked underparts and slightly larger size. Long-billed Spiderhunter can show some streaking on the breast but is much larger and longer-billed, with yellowish underparts. Sometimes noisy, giving loud raspy nasal calls."
0,Bornean Stubtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Urosphena whiteheadi,https://ebird.org/species/borstu1,"Minute, ground-dwelling warbler of Borneo’s central mountain ranges.

Underparts are cool gray-brown and white. Pairs are secretive in coastal evergreen forest and thickets, but they become tame around campsites and gardens, and are particularly prominent at dawn and dusk. The species is often first detected by its musical song that is consistently introduced with a two-note “teee-tooo,” followed by a delightfully varied 4-7 notes that can include imitations of other species. The similar Bearded Scrub-Robin differs from Brown Scrub-Robin by having an orange-buff rump, breast-band, and flanks, and warmer upperparts coloration."
0,Brown Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius cristatus,https://ebird.org/species/brnshr,"Medium-sized shrike with a slender black mask and rufous-brown rump and tail.

0,Cabot's Tragopan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tragopan caboti,https://ebird.org/species/cabtra1,"This creamy, partridge-like beauty is the only tragopan in its range and the world’s only pale-bellied tragopan. A thickset bird, usually encountered foraging in pairs in mid-altitude hill forest. Male is pale below and intricately spotted above, with pale polka dots on a black-and-chestnut background; has a similarly black-and-chestnut head with bright orange facial skin. Female is dark gray-brown with a slightly paler face and belly; wings and belly streaked paler. During courtship, male drums wings loudly and gives a bizarre, scarily infant-like waaah! followed by loud grunting notes."
0,Cachar Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Iole cacharensis,https://ebird.org/species/cacbul1,"A drab, brownish-green bulbul. Face and tail are darker brown, while the vent is rust-colored. The underparts are paler with a tinge of yellow on the throat and belly. Very similar to Olive Bulbul, with which it does not overlap in range, but the Cachar Bulbul is smaller, less rusty on the vent, and has more obvious yellow on the upperparts. Calls include short, wheezy whistles. Inhabits evergreen forests and plantations, where small groups forage in the mid-canopy."
0,Cackling Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Branta hutchinsii,https://ebird.org/species/cacgoo1,"A small, short-necked, stubby-billed goose. Size and shape are best identification clues; note more rounded head, shorter neck, and smaller bill on Cackling. Some are only slightly larger than Mallard. Usually very similar in plumage to Canada Goose, but some Cackling have a more prominent white neck collar. Often forms mixed flocks with other species of geese, grazing in fields or gathering in wetlands. Complex taxonomy includes four subspecies: Richardson’s, Taverner’s, minima, and Aleutian. Richardson’s is most common in central North America and regular in small numbers in the east; it can show a silvery cast to the upperparts and a narrow or diffuse white neck collar. Taverner’s is the largest Cackling subspecies and usually rather pale, very similar to Lesser (or parvipes) Canada Goose but averages stubbier-billed. Minima is smallest and darkest, usually with no neck collar. Well-named Aleutian breeds in the Aleutian Islands and winters along west coast of North America and Japan; it is typically rather dark overall with a bold white neck collar."

The male perches on a small rock or low bush, before rising up 3-5 meters in the air with an accelerating wing-clapping display, then giving a 1-2 note whistled “seeeooo” or “tseee-tseeeooo” and parachuting down to the ground on raised wings. The species runs and creeps on the ground unobtrusively, foraging in tall vegetation. The similar Eastern Clapper Lark is larger than Cape Clapper Lark, with more rufous coloration on the body and wings and a wing-clapping display that is constant in rate, rather than accelerating."
0,Cape Cormorant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax capensis,https://ebird.org/species/capcor1,"A medium-sized, glossy, marine cormorant that is frequently seen in enormous foraging flocks offshore; also dominates rocky coastal roosting sites. Combination of its rounded crestless head, orange throat pouch, and stunning turquoise eye easily identifies adults. Non-breeding and immature plumages are duller, but size and head shape are characteristic. It is the default marine cormorant within its range and forages in much deeper waters than other cormorants."
0,Cape Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus capensis,https://ebird.org/species/capcro2,"All-black crow with an unusually slender bill. Found in a wide variety of open country habitats, including desert, dry savanna, montane grassland, and cultivation. Usually in pairs or small flocks; feeds by walking along the ground. Common call is a typical of crows: a gruff caw. Also gives variable rasping and bubbling vocalizations. The slim bill separates it from all other crows in its range. Lacks the gray neck and breast of House Crow."
0,Cape Gannet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Sulidae,Morus capensis,https://ebird.org/species/capgan1,"Gregarious, strong-flying seabird. Adults are whitish with an apricot-colored head; note also the distinctive blackish arrow-shaped tail and pointed dark wingtips and hind wing. Flocks are often seen from headlands close to the shore. Constant flapping-and-gliding flight pattern and sharp plunge-diving when foraging are unique within range. Dingy brown immatures share the overall shape and flight pattern of adults. At sea, albatrosses hardly ever flap in flight. Other gannets and boobies are mostly absent from its range. Harsh, loud rollicking “wurrah, wurrah, wurrah” given at breeding colonies and while feeding."
0,Cape Grassbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Macrosphenidae,Sphenoeacus afer,https://ebird.org/species/capgra1,"A chunky, streak-backed warbler with a rusty head and wings, a ragged rufous tail, and black moustache stripes. It avoids woodland and trees, preferring rank areas with long grass, scrubby edge, and wet heathland (fynbos). It hops and clambers through dense brush and thickets, then flies low on rapidly-beating wings in labored flight to the next bush, immediately diving into cover. But it will also perch on prominent tall shrubs, like proteas, and sing its melodious tinkling jumbled song that starts softly and gets progressively louder. It also has a distinctive flat mewing “meeeeep” call. The Moustached Grass-Warbler is similar to the Cape Grassbird, but it has a plain unstreaked back, a broad black tail, and a pale eye."
0,Cape Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Poicephalus robustus,https://ebird.org/species/bnnpar2,"Large, dark green parrot. Note the red patches on the shoulder and thighs. The head is pale gray, and the underparts green or blue-green. Found at varied elevations in forest, thick woodland, and plantations. No overlap with the similar Brown-necked Parrot. Call is a shriek that is surprisingly high-pitched for such a robust bird."
0,Cape Verde Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates jabejabe,https://ebird.org/species/cavstp1,"Very similar to Band-rumped and Monteiro's Storm-Petrels, and closely related to those taxa. Breeds only on Cape Verde islands. There are no published field identification features to tell them apart. However it appears that its upperwing pattern is more contrasting and the rump patch is broader. Breeds in burrows and crevices on islands. Burrow calls are different from Band-rumped and Monteiro's by being extremely long, without pauses."
0,Cape Rock-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Monticola rupestris,https://ebird.org/species/carthr1,"A large, chunky, long-tailed rock-thrush. The male has a brown back and uniform blue-gray coloration restricted to the head and throat. The female is differentiated from other rock-thrushes by her shape and rich buff underparts broken only by a small white patch on the central throat. Pairs and small groups occupy rocky areas in grassland, semi-arid country, and fynbos (heath). The species has also adapted to human-modified landscapes, breeding on buildings in hamlets surrounded by vegetation. Other male rock-thrushes have blue-gray backs."
0,Cape Rockjumper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chaetopidae,Chaetops frenatus,https://ebird.org/species/rufroc1,"A striking, gregarious bird that bounces about on rocky mountain slopes and crags in fynbos habitat. The sexes differ: the male has a dark rufous belly and rump, a black throat, and a white moustache; the female is duller, with a streaked chest. Pairs and small groups hop about on the ground and forage for insects between tussocks and shrubs. In territorial display, the male spreads and half-cocks his white-tipped black tail and gives a loud, rollicking “tseeur-rip, tseeur-rip, tseeur-rip” and other piping calls. The similar Drakensberg Rockjumper differs from the Cape Rockjumper by having pale orange-buff underparts and preferring montane grasslands."
0,Cape Shoveler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula smithii,https://ebird.org/species/capsho1,"A large, elongated, speckled, brown duck with a distinctive and extended spatula-shaped black bill. In flight the sky-blue forewing is distinctive; no other regularly occurring duck species shares this feature. Male has a gray head, yellow eye, and yellow-orange feet; female has a rusty-brown head, dark eye, and gray-yellow feet. Within its range, the Northern Shoveler is an extremely rare vagrant, and it differs from Cape Shoveller by the following features: male in breeding plumage has a green head and chestnut belly; female and juvenile are in general paler and more warmly colored, but some individuals may be inseparable from female Cape Shoveller."
0,Cape Siskin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra totta,https://ebird.org/species/capsis2,"A small, flighty, brown-lemon siskin of fynbos heathland, forest edge, plantations, and gullies in the arid Karoo; partial to rocky outcrops. The lemon rump, visible in flight, and the white-tipped tail and wing feathers most easily identify it. The male has a yellowish throat and underparts; the female is browner with a lightly streaked throat. The species is most often found in small groups of 2-10 individuals. A high-pitched two-note “tcheew-cheee” contact call frequently leads to detection. The similar Cape Canary has a distinctive gray hindneck and lacks the Cape Siskin’s white on the wings and tail."
0,Cape Verde Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer iagoensis,https://ebird.org/species/cavspa1,"Found only on Cape Verde islands. Male is unmistakable with a chestnut eyebrow extending down to the sides of the neck, a small dark bib, rich chestnut shoulders and scapulars. Female has a warm buff eyebrow. Breeds in dry open habitats, but also in towns and villages. Calls are similar to that of House Sparrow."
0,Cape Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis nitens,https://ebird.org/species/capgls1,"A medium-sized iridescent blue-green glossy starling that lacks dark ear-patches and has greenish flanks and belly, giving it a more uniform appearance than the “blue-eared” starlings. Pairs and small groups occupy high-altitude grassland, Karoo, and savanna, including drier habitats than other glossy starlings. The species feeds on the ground and in trees on fruit and insects; often it scavenges from people. It gives a rolling “turrreaau” flight call and harsh “karrr” alarm notes. Similar “blue-eared” starlings differ from Cape Starling by being smaller and having blue-magenta flanks and belly that give them a less uniform appearance."
0,Cape Sugarbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Promeropidae,Promerops cafer,https://ebird.org/species/capsug1,"A large nectar-eating bird with a decurved beak and a long graduated tail. Dull brown above, it has strong moustache-like stripes and a yellow undertail. Pairs breed in mature mountain fynbos, where they are tied to flowering Proteas. After breeding they become nomadic, moving to areas where food is available. The species sings a characteristic grating, chipping, and twanging song. The smaller Gurney’s Sugarbird is similar, but has a much shorter graduated tail, a rusty breast and crown, and a less harsh song, and lacks the moustache-like stripes on the face."
0,Cape Teal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas capensis,https://ebird.org/species/captea1,"Medium-sized, pale gray duck with a pink bill. In flight, shows a green patch that is surrounded by white. Prefers saltwater wetlands such as natural saltpans and man-made saltworks but sometimes also uses freshwater wetlands. Similar to Red-billed Duck, but without a dark cap, and with paler overall coloration. Pink bill separates Cape Teal from all other ducks and grebes in the region."
0,Cape Wagtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Motacilla capensis,https://ebird.org/species/capwag1,"Elegant, long-tailed bird with a brownish back, pale underparts, and a black chest band. White outer tail is conspicuous in flight. Found in most open habitats, especially those near water. Feeds by walking along the ground, bobbing its tail constantly. Call is a buzzy “tseeei” that is often doubled. Song is a complex jumble of different repeated notes. Similar to Mountain Wagtail but has brown rather than gray upperparts, and Cape has less white in the wings and tail. Also similar to juvenile African Pied Wagtail but lacks a white panel in the wing."
0,Cape Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus capensis,https://ebird.org/species/capwea1,"A large weaver with a long, thin pointed bill. The male has a pale eye, and during the breeding season a brownish wash to the face. The female has a brown eye and an olive-brown belly. The species occupies open country, where it often breeds in mixed-species colonies over water or in large isolated trees. The chattering and rasping song is long and complex. The smaller Southern Brown-throated Weaver has a chunkier bill than Cape Weaver; its male has a better defined brown throat and its female has a white belly. African Golden-Weaver has reddish eyes, and Holub’s Golden-Weaver has an unstreaked yellowish back."
0,Capped Conebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Conirostrum albifrons,https://ebird.org/species/capcon1,"Small tanager-like bird found in the subtropical zone of the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia. Sharp pointed bill. Male is dark blackish overall with cobalt highlights shoulder and rump, and a blue (south) or white (north) crown. Female very different: olive above with gray head and chest and yellow belly. Her blue crown can be difficult to see. Even in poor light, easily picked out of a mixed-species flock by its frequent tail pumping."
0,Capped Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Pilherodius pileatus,https://ebird.org/species/capher1,"This gorgeous medium-sized heron is uncommon but widespread in lowlands of South America, barely extending into eastern Panama. Not likely to be mistaken: combination of silvery back, buffy neck and belly, black cap, and blue lores (sometimes radiant turquoise!) help distinguish this species from other herons. Also note the long white plumes on the back of the head. Occurs around swamps, forested ponds, and rivers, usually singly."
0,Capped Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe pileata,https://ebird.org/species/capwhe1,"Boldly-patterned open country chat. Note the white eyebrow, black mask through the eye, and black band across the chest. The outer half of the tail is black and the inner half white, which is conspicuous in flight. Found in desert, dry savanna, and short grassland. Often perches up on fences and other structures. Variable song is a fast series of clucks and whistles."
0,Capuchin Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides atripennis,https://ebird.org/species/capbab1,"A chunky, short-tailed babbler with a purple-brown body, a yellowish bill and legs, and a mostly silver-gray head; the amount of black and gray on the throat and crown differ geographically. Unmistakable if seen well. Family groups of 5–12 are local residents skulking in the undergrowth and tangles of forest, secondary growth, and riparian thickets in savanna. Groups mostly communicate with dry harsh grating calls and chattering, but occasionally give a whimsical high-pitched, downslurred thrush-like whistle: “wheeeer.”"
0,Capuchinbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Perissocephalus tricolor,https://ebird.org/species/capuch1,"Large, bizarre bird of tall rainforest. Unmistakable even when seen briefly, as they often are, flying quickly across roads or rivers. Appears broad-winged and mostly burnt orange with a disproportionately small head. Feeds on fruit in the forest canopy. Far-carrying display call of lekking males is one of the strangest avian sounds, similar to a distant chain saw or cow; males on leks can seem almost oblivious to human observers."
0,Caracas Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Arremon phaeopleurus,https://ebird.org/species/sthbrf6,"Boldly patterned sparrow with black head and white eyebrow. Back and tail olive-yellow, underparts white; black band across chest. Found alone or in pairs or family groups on ground or at mid-level in dense understory, second growth vegetation at forest edges, and coffee plantations. Can often be detected by listening for the movement of leaves as it forages. Song and calls are repetitive and very high-pitched. No similar species in range. Endemic to the Coastal Cordillera of Venezuela."
0,Caracas Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus caracae,https://ebird.org/species/cartap1,"A typical tapaculo, in bad light a plain and dark small bird with short tail. In good view, mostly plain dark gray with brown and slightly barred belly. Female more barred than male, and juvenile mostly brown and markedly barred. Acts like a mouse, staying near the ground in dense understory of bamboo thickets in cloud forest. Song nasal and noisy, one of the signature sounds in the mountains near Caracas; one version a series of four notes “wu-E-e-wu” and the another a faster series of 6 notes “wu-wU-e-e-wu-wu”; varied calls, the most common a descending mechanical rattle. The only tapaculo in its limited range in the Coastal Cordillera of Venezuela."
0,Carbonated Sierra Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Rhopospina carbonaria,https://ebird.org/species/casfin1,"Plump tanager of arid lowlands in central Argentina, chiefly in northern Patagonian scrub. Similar to larger Mourning Sierra-Finch, but Carbonated has a less deeply curved top of bill, extensive black on underparts, and, in males, a pure yellow bill."
0,Cardinal Lory,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Pseudeos cardinalis,https://ebird.org/species/carlor1,"A thick-bodied, long-tailed parrot with entirely red plumage. The head appears slightly brighter than the body. Widespread in most habitats up to around 1200 meters of elevation. Unlikely to be misidentified due to its unique entirely red coloration. Most common call is a high-pitched rising “tsleet!”"
0,Cardinal Myzomela,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Myzomela cardinalis,https://ebird.org/species/carmyz1,"A small, strikingly plumaged myzomela with a bright crimson red head, back, and rump and black wings, belly, chest, and tail. Thin bill decurved. Female mostly dark reddish, with darker ruddy brownish coloration where male would be black. Seems to prefer forest habitats, but widespread. Unique coloration of both sexes should identify this species with certainty. Vocally shy. Common call is a repeated high-pitched, insect-like “tseet.”"
0,Cardinal Quelea,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Quelea cardinalis,https://ebird.org/species/carque1,"The red head of the breeding male is distinctive. Non-breeding male and female are nondescript streaky brown birds with buffy eyebrows. Found in moist, grassy habitats, where it often appears after recent rain. Most records are of territorial breeding males. Becomes inconspicuous when not breeding, mixing with flocks of other weavers and seedeaters. The call is a rough “chyet” and the song is an accelerating series of annoyed-sounding notes. Breeding male very similar to breeding male Red-headed Quelea, but has less red on the nape and more on the breast, for a more cleanly “hooded” look."
0,Cardinal Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Chloropicus fuscescens,https://ebird.org/species/carwoo1,"A small, compact woodpecker with heavily streaked underparts and a solid black moustachial streak. In the female the top of the head is completely dark, while in the male the forecrown is brown and hindcrown and nape are red. Pairs inhabit a wide range of savanna, woodland, forest-edge, and riverine forest, where they feed in dead branches and smaller twigs ignored by larger woodpeckers. An angry-sounding, dry, trilled rattle call often gives it away."
0,Carib Grackle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Quiscalus lugubris,https://ebird.org/species/cargra1,"Common in northern South America and the Lesser Antilles. Found in a variety of open habitats, including around towns and cities, especially abundant along the coast. Male is glossy black with a pointed bill and a yellow eye. Tail is fairly long and wedge-shaped. Females are dark grayish-brown with slightly paler on underparts and a yellow eye. Smaller and shorter-tailed than Great-tailed Grackle."
0,Caribbean Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Leptotila jamaicensis,https://ebird.org/species/cardov1,"Retiring dove of forest floor, heard much more frequently than seen. Like other members of the genus, can be found walking quietly on shady roadsides and trails, especially early and late in the day. Not easily told by sight from White-tipped Dove, which occurs alongside Caribbean in Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Best feature is white face and pale bluish nape of Caribbean Dove. Also compare Gray-headed Dove. In flight, all species show white tail corners and rusty on underwings."
0,Caribbean Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia martinica,https://ebird.org/species/carela1,"Rather drab and inconspicuous flycatcher of tropical woodland, semi-open areas with bushes and trees. Often found at fruiting trees, where eats small berries. Limited overlap in range with slightly larger and brighter Yellow-bellied Elaenia, which has a spiky, white-based crest, unlike Caribbean, which usually holds its crest flattened; also note that Caribbean has a bright orange base to the underside of its bill, duller wingbars, and different voice; does not flick its wings or tail."
0,Caribbean Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/carmar1,"A graceful aerial feeder found over a wide variety of open habitats, especially near water, including marshes and towns. Often seen on exposed perches including power and telephone lines in villages. Commonly found in flocks of up to twenty birds, sometimes mixing with other swallows and martins. Note the male’s diagnostic glossy purple-blue plumage and snow-white belly. Females and immatures are similarly patterned, but have brown mixed with the blue and are probably not safely separable from Cuban Martin. Female and immature Purple Martins are very similar, but they often have a scaly breast and finely streaked belly, with less contrast between belly and chest. Notably, Cuban and Purple Martins are not present in this species’ range from March to September. Calls include a harsh “churr,” a buzzy “zwick-zwick,” and a musical buzzy burbling."
0,Carmelite Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Chalcomitra fuliginosa,https://ebird.org/species/carsun2,"A large, dark sunbird that is usually found near the coast, although inland populations exist locally, perhaps most notably in Angola. Occurs in a variety of disturbed and edge habitats as well as in swamps and coastal woods. Males are overall chocolate-brown with iridescent purple-pink throats and foreheads, while females are a much paler olive-brown with noticeably darker throats. Bill is relatively straight. Distinguished from the smaller and more compact Green-throated Sunbird by its larger size, its small purple throat and crown, and the female’s dark throat. Calls include liquid “pip” notes and buzzy trills, with songs comprising variable combinations of these notes."
0,Carmiol's Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Chlorothraupis carmioli,https://ebird.org/species/olitan1,"Large, chunky tanager. Very nondescript: entirely olive-green with greenish-yellow throat. Note thick bill. Sexes alike. Usually found in groups, sometimes in mixed feeding flocks with other species. Stays fairly low in the lower and middle levels of forests in lowlands and foothills. Listen for its strikingly loud song in the early morning."
0,Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Cacatuidae,Calyptorhynchus latirostris,https://ebird.org/species/slbblc1,"Black cockatoo with white ear patch and white tail panel, found in the southwestern corner of Western Australia, where it inhabits a wide variety of habitats, including woodlands, pine plantations, farmland, and urban parks. The very similar Baudin’s Black-Cockatoo has much longer upper mandible. Calls include mournful, wailing cries, as well as loud, rough screeches."
0,Carola's Parotia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Parotia carolae,https://ebird.org/species/carpar1,"A fairly large, short-tailed bird of mid-montane forest canopy. Male is mainly black with white flanks, golden throat, bronzy-scaled chest, white stripe down the forehead and 6 antennalike feathers projecting from the back of the head. Note the yellow eye. Female is gray-brown above and strongly-barred below with a heavy white stripe above the eye. Male dances at a terrestrial court, where it gives one of the most elaborate displays in the bird world. Co-occurs with Lawes’s Parotia but Carola’s male has white flanks and female lacks a black head. One of many different vocalizations is a loud, quavering shriek."
0,Carolina Chickadee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile carolinensis,https://ebird.org/species/carchi,"This tiny, plump-bodied, big-headed bird is a familiar woodland resident and backyard visitor in the southeastern U.S. The only chickadee in almost all of its range. Gray overall with contrasting head pattern: black cap, white cheek, and black throat. Short, stubby bill is used for hammering open seeds. Often the core of mixed flocks of songbirds. Visits feeders. Nearly identical to Black-capped Chickadee, but range barely overlaps. Especially note voice, duller gray wings, and less buffy coloration on flanks of Carolina. Beware that hybrids occur frequently in the overlap zone and some are best left unidentified."
0,Carolina Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Conuropsis carolinensis,https://ebird.org/species/carpar,"Extinct, last reported in 1918."
0,Carolina Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Thryothorus ludovicianus,https://ebird.org/species/carwre,"Bold white eyebrow. Warm brown above, buffy-orange underparts. Slightly decurved bill. Tail is about as long as body and often cocked up. Usually in hiding in dense vegetation, tangled understory, or brush piles in forested areas. Nests in peculiar places around backyards, such as tucked in a drainpipe or grill. Occasionally feeds on suet or mealworms at feeding stations. Listen for loud, ringing song and variety of calls. Unlike House Wren they are not migratory and stay nearby their breeding grounds year-round."
0,Carp's Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Melaniparus carpi,https://ebird.org/species/cartit2,"A black tit with a mostly white wing and outer tail. The sexes are similar, but females are slightly duller and browner. Found in arid savanna and mopane woodland. Usually in pairs or small groups, which are loud and conspicuous. Call is a classic tit “chee-chi-chi-chi-chi,” raspy and often repeated. Overlaps very locally with the very similar Southern Black-Tit in northern Namibia. Carp’s Tit can be identified by its all-black rather than white-barred undertail, and by having more white in the wing."
0,Carpentarian Grasswren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Amytornis dorotheae,https://ebird.org/species/cargra2,"Small, long-tailed, brown-and-black-streaked bird with white throat, rusty flanks, and black moustache. Known from a few small areas from around Borroloola (Northern Territory) to near Mount Isa (Queensland), where large spinifex clumps grow in sandstone outcrops or stony hills. Frequent burning of these areas has made this species very hard to find. Usually seen foraging on the ground in pairs or small groups. Near Mount Isa, there is possible range overlap with Kalkadoon Grasswren (lacks the white throat; more uniformly brown)."
0,Carrion Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus corone,https://ebird.org/species/carcro1,"The quintessential big black crow, without obvious field marks. Juvenile Rook has longer, more pointed bill with more extensive feathering on base. Smaller than Common Raven, which has longer, wedge-shaped tail, heavier bill, shaggy throat, and deeper voice. Ravens soar and glide readily, whereas crows typically flap continuously. Common in varied open and semi-open habitats from towns and farmland to open woodland and moorland. Found in pairs or small groups; large flocks only at roosts. Typically gives raucous caws."
0,Carrizal Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Amaurospiza carrizalensis,https://ebird.org/species/carsee1,"Small, chunky finch with thick gray bill. Male deep blue-black, female brown, both sexes with white underwings. Mostly found in pairs in the understory of spiny bamboo forest. Song a fast musical warble of four or six notes “pee PEEu pee PEEu peePEEuu.” Similar to Blue-black Grassquit, which is smaller with a more conical bill; also to Amazonian Grosbeak, which is larger with a bulkier bill. Little known, endemic to the southern lowlands of Venezuela."
0,Carruthers's Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola carruthersi,https://ebird.org/species/carcis1,"Relatively colorful, mid-sized, long-tailed cisticola. Note the gray-brown back with thick black streaks, rufous on the wing and cap, and whitish underparts. Found mainly in papyrus swamp and locally in other wetland habitats. Song is a quick, aggressive series of several “chyap” notes. Very similar to Winding Cisticola, and best separated by song; Carruther’s also has a less reddish panel in the wing and a mostly dark tail."
0,Carunculated Caracara,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Phalcoboenus carunculatus,https://ebird.org/species/carcar1,"Strikingly patterned raptor of the high Andes in Ecuador and southern Colombia. Note pied plumage pattern, white streaks on black breast, and orange face. Immatures are brown with pale patches in the wings (visible in flight). Similar to Mountain Caracara, which may overlap with it in southern Ecuador, but adult Carunculated has breast streaking, and immatures have barring on rump. Inhabits open areas such as paramo and farmland, sometimes congregating in large numbers."
0,Carunculated Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus granulifrons,https://ebird.org/species/cafdov1,"A unique small, colorful fruit-dove confined to Obi island. Pale gray head contrasts with mostly emerald-green body, except for gray markings on the wings and back, a deep maroon belly patch, and a lemon-yellow vent and undertail. An odd, fleshy wattle of protruding yellowish skin above the bill (“caruncles”) is distinctive. Found in canopy of forest, forest edge, and nearby secondary growth in the lowlands. Gives a distinctive soft, deep, guttural call, “gu-rOW,” the first note often soft and hard to hear."
0,Caspian Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus cachinnans,https://ebird.org/species/casgul2,"Difficult to separate from Yellow-legged Gulls and Herring Gulls without a careful appraisal of plumage characters. Candidate birds may draw attention by slender-billed, long-legged, and slim appearance. Flattened crown, rather small dark eyes, and usually unstreaked head are also useful characters. Wingtip (primary) feathers in adults have long tongues of white that penetrate into the black tips. Juveniles have prominent pale underwings. Breeds and winters predominantly on inland water bodies with some movement toward coasts in winter."
0,Caspian Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius asiaticus,https://ebird.org/species/casplo1,"Stately plover with a gentle, dovelike expression. Breeding male is stunning, with a white face and belly separated by a broad chestnut patch across the chest. Breeding female is plainer brown, and has a warm rusty-brown patch across the chest. Nonbreeding adults and juveniles are grayish-brown with pale fringes to the feathers of the upperparts, as well as a pale face and belly. Oriental Plover is similar in nonbreeding plumage, but note the white stripe on the wing when Caspian is in flight. Inhabits open areas, near water when breeding and often away from it when wintering. Gives short nasal calls when in flight."
0,Caspian Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus caspius,https://ebird.org/species/cassno1,"As other snowcocks, Caspian Snowcock is large and heavy and is gray overall with a paler head pattern and white undertail coverts. Compared to the very similar Caucasian Snowcock, Caspian is slightly paler, especially breast, and plumage includes gray tones on nape. Breeds on extreme high, rocky mountains. Song is a loonlike, desolate, far-carrying cry."
0,Caspian Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Hydroprogne caspia,https://ebird.org/species/caster1,"Largest tern in the world; widespread but typically uncommon. Thick, bright-red bill is distinctive; most have small dark marking near the tip. Note solid black cap in summer which turns to black streaks in winter. Juveniles have V-shaped markings on the upperparts. Feeds by cruising over lakes, rivers, estuaries, and reservoirs looking for fish, then plunging to catch them. Smooth wingbeats, more gull-like than choppy flight of small-bodied terns. Very vocal, giving loud raucous screams. Compare especially with Royal Tern, which is slightly smaller and more slender, and has a thinner, more orangey bill."
0,Caspian Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile hyrcanus,https://ebird.org/species/castit2,"Small plain tit. Note diagnostic brown cap, raggedly-demarcated bib, and richly-colored dark brown upperparts. Very similar to closely-related Sombre Tit, but ranges do not overlap.

Found in varied habitats from parks and gardens to farmland and other semiopen habitats with hedges and taller trees. Two distinct populations: in northern and western birds, sexes look alike, dark ashy gray overall with a yellow bill and amber eyes; in southern and eastern birds, male is dull blackish with a yellow bill and eyering and female is dark ashy gray overall with a yellow bill. No similar species in Chile, but in Bolivia and Peru compare with larger Great Thrush, which prefers more humid habitats."
0,Chihuahuan Raven,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus cryptoleucus,https://ebird.org/species/chirav,"The raven of dry grasslands and desert scrub from the southwestern U.S. to central Mexico. Very similar to Common Raven, and sometimes best left unidentified. Chihuahuan is slightly smaller and more compact than Common, and tends to be found in more open habitats at lower elevations, not in mountains or forests (although Common can be found in low grasslands, too). Neck feathers are white at the base on Chihuahuan, instead of gray. Occurs in pairs or flocks, sometimes quite large, especially in winter. Gives a rather dry, crow-like squawk."
0,Chilean Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus chilensis,https://ebird.org/species/chifla1,"Widespread and often numerous; found at shallow lakes and lagoons from the high Andes to Patagonian steppe and even in coastal waters. Adult is distinctive: pale pink with a salmon-pink “bustle” and grayish legs with red feet and “knees.” Immature often obviously smaller than adult, but has longer bill “hook” than the smaller and shorter-legged James’s Flamingo. Chilean Flamingo lacks the clean-cut black triangle on closed wings seen on Andean Flamingo. Far-carrying calls can suggest honking of geese."

0,Chinese Bamboo-Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Bambusicola thoracicus,https://ebird.org/species/chbpar3,"While common in bamboo forest, this loud and colorful partridge can be found in a range of other shrubby and semiopen habitats. Not particularly shy; singing males can be located by their far-carrying song, a rising series of piercing single and triple notes. The combination of a gray-blue brow and chest, orange cheeks and breast band, and large black spots on brownish yellow flanks make this species unmistakable in its range."
0,Chinese Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Megalaimidae,Psilopogon faber,https://ebird.org/species/chibar1,"A brightly-colored inhabitant of tropical forest canopies. Slow moving and well camouflaged; its loud and far-carrying song, combined with its secrecy, ensure that it is usually heard far more often than seen. If seen well, combination of red-and-yellow throat, blue ear, black crown, and green body distinguish it from any other similarly sized birds in its range. Regularly visits fruiting trees."
0,Chinese Beautiful Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus davidianus,https://ebird.org/species/chbros1,"A heavily marked rosefinch that is closely related to and extremely similar to Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch. Male averages more extensively pink with a broader pink brow. The female, on the other hand is almost indistinguishable; look for a more square-tipped and slightly shorter tail. Best distinguished by calls; gives sharp metallic notes instead of Himalayan Beautiful’s more mellow trills and twitters. Inhabits similar montane scrub and open forest habitat, occasionally ventures down into the outskirts of towns and villages; often singly or in pairs."

Rich dark chocolate brown above and finely scaled below with distinctly black-centered pale fathers; darker birds have black-and-tan underparts, while light birds have black-and-white ones. Speckling of tan spots on the crown and neck distinguish this species from the smaller Pygmy Cupwing. Extremely similar to closely related Scaly-breasted Cupwing; best distinguished by range and song. Shy and difficult to see. Skulks about in wet, well-shaded areas in foothill and montane forests, often near streams, gullies, and boulder fields. Far more easily heard than seen; listen for its a loud ascending series of fluid warbling notes."
0,Chinese Egret,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Egretta eulophotes,https://ebird.org/species/chiegr,"Medium-sized white egret. Breeding adult has bright blue loral skin, a pinkish-orange bill, and long frilly plumes on the head, neck, and back. Nonbreeding adult lack plumes and has dull greenish legs and bill. Nonbreeding birds can be confused with Little Egret, but note Chinese Egret's thicker bill, proportionally stouter legs, orangish base to the bill, and dark lores with a shallow crook between eyes and bill. Light morph of Pacific Reef-Heron may also be similar, but average much thicker-billed and thicker-legged than Chinese. Moves between craggy islands and coastlines when breeding; winters in mangroves, estuaries, and mudflats."
0,Chinese Francolin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Francolinus pintadeanus,https://ebird.org/species/chifra1,"Gamebird of dry, shrubby areas; especially common in hilly and montane regions. Male has white cheeks and rufous on the crown, shoulders, and vent, but is predominantly covered with delicate black-and-white scaling. Female is similarly intricate in her patterning but is browner and less bright overall. Singing males often stand on exposed rocks and hilltops to give their song, a metallic series of notes often likened to “come-to-the-peak-ah-ah!”"
0,Chinese Fulvetta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Fulvetta striaticollis,https://ebird.org/species/chiful1,"Dull brown fulvetta with pale eyes, found only in central and south-central China. Note streaky throat, dark lores, and pale, narrow wing panel. Distinctive in its blandness; no other fulvetta in the region is essentially all brown with no dark eyebrows or significant patches of warmer, brighter colors. Occurs at 2200-4300 meters, favoring areas with shrubby oak or rhododendron cover. Typically forages low down or at middle levels of forest. Not as social as the “Alcippe” fulvettas, and are often encountered singly or in pairs, though small groups do occur. Song is a simple but variable series of whistles in which the first note or two rise and the last one or two fall, sometimes with an intermediary note in between: “tsi-tsi-dih-deer-deer.” Call is a high-pitched chittery rattle."
0,Chinese Grassbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pellorneidae,Graminicola striatus,https://ebird.org/species/chigra1,"A seldom seen and poorly understood shy, streaky, brown babbler. Stays low and hidden in tall grassy and reedy vegetation within fields and wetlands. Brown above with a pale breast and a long tail. The crown and back are streaked with black, giving it the appearance of an overgrown cisticola, but the distinctive patch of black-and-white streaking on the nape is unlike that of any warbler. Appears singly and in pairs."
0,Chinese Hwamei,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Garrulax canorus,https://ebird.org/species/melthr,"A medium-sized thrushlike bird of dense forests and undergrowth. The reddish brown coloration and white spectacles are distinctive. Usually skulks in dense vegetation, but may sing from an exposed perch or forage out in the open during dawn and dusk. Usually observed singly or in pairs. The song is loud, long, and varied, involving mimicry of other birds, whistles, and harsh notes that are often repeated. Introduced to Taiwan, Japan, and the Hawaiian Islands."
0,Chinese Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus yunnanensis,https://ebird.org/species/chilew1,"Small plump leaf warbler. A “Pallas’s-type” leaf warbler: stout, with a pale rump, crown stripe, and prominent brow stripes. Olive-yellow above with a faint gray wash on the nape. Chinese is distinguished from Pallas’s by its paler, more faded-looking brow and crown stripes, less yellow suffusion all over the body, less compact appearance, and less obvious or absent upper wingbar. Extremely similar Gansu Leaf Warbler and Lemon-rumped Warbler can be difficult to separate; note Chinese’s slightly more elongated and less rounded appearance, a lack of a distinct hook under the end of the brow stripe, less contrasting and more yellowish head patterning, and paler yellowish secondaries. Forages actively, often hovering and hopping about at mid-level. Breeds in montane broadleaved deciduous or mixed forest; moves to lower elevations in winter. On average, found at lower altitudes than Lemon-rumped and Gansu. Lengthy song is unique and bizarre, with a twanging, grating quality: “btrichi-btrichi-btrichi.” Call is an explosive “wip!”, often repeated in medium-length series on the breeding grounds."

Calls are high-pitched and thin, often with a rasping quality."
0,Chinese Pond-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola bacchus,https://ebird.org/species/chpher1,"Often mistaken for an egret in flight due to its all-white wings, but the dark head separates it from any egret. This medium-sized heron is found across many different marshy habitats. Breeding adults have a chestnut head, neck, and breast, and a veil of bluish-black plumes over the white wings. Nonbreeding adults and juveniles are brown all over save for the white wings. In areas where the ranges of multiple pond-heron species overlap, nonbreeders and juveniles are best left unidentified."
0,Chinese Rubythroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope tschebaiewi,https://ebird.org/species/chirub1,"Handsome male is gray above with a bright red throat, black chest, and white belly. Also note white eyebrows and “moustache” stripe, as well as white panels and edges on a black tail. Female is duller, cold gray-brown above with a white belly and throat. Extremely similar to Himalayan Rubythroat: note gray flecking on white flanks of male and white “moustache” (striking in males, pale and sometimes unnoticeable in females). Breeds in alpine and subalpine open areas with scattered scrub and boulders; preferred habitat averages higher and more open than Himalayan. Winters in lowland scrub. Song is a series of loud rich warbles, which average shorter and less varied than those of Himalayan Rubythroat."
0,Chinese Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx sinensis,https://ebird.org/species/whbsho5,"Shy and skulky ground-dweller of hill forests with dense undergrowth; especially favors damp, dark areas near streams, fallen trunks, and accumulated debris. Male is slate-blue, with paler undertail and lower belly; also note his thin white eyebrow. Female is dark dirt-brown, with paler underparts and a faint rufous eyering. Difficult to see in tangled understory, but can be readily detected through the male’s song, a series of pure, short whistles followed by a quick jumble of notes, which sometimes include a buzz. Calls include a “tchik” and a rattling series."
0,Chinese Sparrowhawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter soloensis,https://ebird.org/species/grfhaw1,"Attractive accipiter of wooded habitats. Adult gray above with orange-suffused white underparts; also note bright yellow cere (skin around the nostrils).

Note the gray-brown back with thick black streaks, dull rufous on the wing and cap, and pale underparts. Found in reedbeds, especially papyrus and phragmites. The distinctive song is a few hesitant “chyep” calls followed by a long, dry trill. Very similar to Luapula Cisticola, and best separated by song. Visually, Chirping Cisticola is slightly larger, the tail is browner, and the rufous crown and wing patch are duller."
0,Chirruping Wedgebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Psophodidae,Psophodes cristatus,https://ebird.org/species/chiwed2,"Plain gray plump songbird with dark tail, white wingbar, and a small forward-curving crest.

0,Choco Toucan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Ramphastidae,Ramphastos brevis,https://ebird.org/species/chotou1,"Large black and yellow toucan with a yellow stripe on the top of the bill. Inhabits lowland and foothill rainforest west of the Andes. Similar to chestnut-mandibled races of Yellow-throated Toucan, but with black on the lower part of the bill. This can be hard to distinguish in poor light, so voice is often the best way to ID: it makes a rasping or croaking call instead of a yelp."
0,Choco Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Zimmerius albigularis,https://ebird.org/species/chotyr1,"Small flycatcher found in canopy of lowland and foothill forest in northwestern Ecuador and southwestern Colombia.

0,Christmas Island Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox natalis,https://ebird.org/species/chihao1,"Small, distinctive boobook with extensive chestnut-brown barring. Favors surviving primary rainforest, but can sometimes be found in secondary growth; can be found on roadsides through suitable habitat when hunting. The only resident owl on the island; the migratory Northern Boobook is a winter visitor to the island, and is significantly larger and much darker overall, with an all-brown head and brown-striped white underparts. Present species gives an odd, distorted-sounding “qwr-qwerk.” Begging birds give a shrill trill. Unfortunately, like many other Christmas Island species, has suffered declines due to the introduced yellow crazy ant, which has caused the owl to disappear from parts of its range."
0,Christmas Island Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata andrewsi,https://ebird.org/species/chifri1,"One of the largest of the frigatebirds; females are larger than males.

Usually forages actively high up in the canopy, clambering along branches. Breeds in well-forested areas, but can be found in sparser forest edges in the winter. A large leaf warbler, it has a pale belly, weak wingbars, and a strong brow and crown pattern. Listen for its song, a squeaky and repetitive series of rolling whistled notes.The closely related Hartert’s Leaf Warbler is very similar but averages brighter yellow, especially on the crown stripe. Calls of the two species are very similar—a quick ‘pee-chuh!’—but their breeding ranges do not overlap. Overlaps on wintering grounds with very similar Blyth’s Leaf Warbler, from which it may be impossible to separate at times; note whiter brow stripe (particularly at the back), less yellow underparts, and slightly different voice."

0,Collared Gnatwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Microbates collaris,https://ebird.org/species/colgna1,"A tiny, long-billed bird of forest understory. Brown above and white below with a black crescent across the chest. Note striking facial pattern with white eyebrow and black malar mark. General impression is wren-like with long bill, contrasting eyebrow, and tail usually held cocked. Difficult to see well, as it tends to remain in dense understory growth around treefalls and other gaps in tall rainforest, where it is locally distributed and never common. Usually seen alone or in pairs. Song is a long, descending whistle, repeated at roughly three-second intervals, very similar in tone and pace to second note of Tawny-crowned Greenlet’s song. Harsh scolding note is perhaps the best giveaway to this species’s presence. Generally unmistakable given a decent view; in silhouette could be confused with Long-billed Gnatwren but has much stronger face pattern and is usually confined to dense undergrowth rather than the vine tangles inhabited by Long-billed."
0,Collared Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Mycerobas affinis,https://ebird.org/species/colgro1,"Large, bulky, bright-colored finch of middle to high altitude broadleaf and mixed forests. Male has a jet-black head and back and a bright yellow belly and collar. Female is olive-yellow overall with a gray head and black wingtips. Both sexes have a pale, heavy bill. Usually seen in pairs or small flocks. Often perches on exposed treetops. Gives a mellow, descending series of notes while in flight. Passingly similar in appearance to Spot-winged and White-winged Grosbeaks, but Collared Grosbeak lacks white on the wing."
0,Collared Imperial-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula mullerii,https://ebird.org/species/coipig1,"The large, nomadic pigeon of mangroves and riverine forests. Note the distinctive, full black collar that narrows at the front and meets the maroon back. Black tail with white band across. Small flocks often seen in flight or perched up on exposed branches. Unmistakable when seen perched, but in flight similar to Pinon’s Imperial-Pigeon. Collared Imperial-Pigeon is much more likely in mangroves. Call, a deep, muffled “woo-oo pooo” with the first 2-note call falling and the last, lower in pitch."
0,Collared Inca,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Coeligena torquata,https://ebird.org/species/colinc1,"Large hummingbird with striking white flashes in tail. Chest patch is usually white, but some populations are rufous. Otherwise mostly dark green, almost black, with iridescent crown varying from purple to green. Females similar to males but slightly duller. Fairly common at fairly high elevations, mostly above 2,000 m, within or at edges of cloud forest. Often seen feeding at roadside flowers. Visits feeders."
0,Collared Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Todiramphus chloris,https://ebird.org/species/colkin1,"A mid-sized kingfisher with a variable plumage pattern; nearly 50 subspecies described worldwide. All of them have a greenish-blue crown, a white spot above the lores, a black mask extending down as a narrow band across the hindneck, and a white collar. Upperparts are greenish-blue, rump brighter blue, with blue wings and tail and white underparts. Female and juvenile slightly duller. Subspecies mainly differ in plumage, with upperparts varying from blue to green to olive-toned, white loral spot sometimes extending as a supercilium, and underparts sometimes buffier. Gives carious vocalizations, but most common call is a “kek-kek-kek-kek.” Frequents mangroves and tidal creeks, though sometimes inhabits other coastal habitats, including coconut plantations in islands."
0,Collared Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra collaris,https://ebird.org/species/collar1,An elegant lark with rich rusty upperparts and white feather fringes that create a scaly effect. The complete dark band across the chest and the dark streaking on the nape are unique; the white eyebrow and throat create a bold face pattern. Underparts are pale and clean. Resident in dry thorn savanna on red sands. Its long whistle “wheeeeooooo” is sometimes accompanied with a wing-clapping display in which the bird rises 10–15 meters before parachuting back to the ground. Foxy Lark is similar to Collared in shape and coloration but lacks the dark breast and neck markings.
0,Collared Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Trochalopteron yersini,https://ebird.org/species/collau1,"Halloween-themed laughingthrush: decked out in black, gray, and orange. Combination of black head, silver ear patch, orange neck and breast, and multicolored wings are unmistakable in range. Bizarrely reminiscent in patterning of much smaller Silver-eared Mesia and Golden-breasted Fulvetta. Inhabits mid- to high-altitude forests, where it rummages around in the understory in small groups. Makes an odd rising, screaming yodel that sounds strangely like the call of an Indian Peafowl."
0,Collared Lory,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Vini solitarius,https://ebird.org/species/collor1,"A beautiful multicolored parrot with a dark purple crown, a bright green neck, a red chest and throat, a purple belly, and green upperparts and undertail. The bright yellow bill is obvious. Widespread in most habitats, including towns and gardens. Unique within its range. A typically parrot-like “tzreet” is the most common call, with similar squabbling calls often heard."
0,Collared Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Acridotheres albocinctus,https://ebird.org/species/colmyn1,"A dark myna with a creamy collar. Generally uncommon throughout its restricted range; often found on agricultural fields and on the outskirts of villages and rural towns. Usually mixes with other myna and starling species, particularly Crested and Great Mynas, in whose flocks it tends to be a minority, but its prominent smudgy collar makes it readily identifiable even from a distance."
0,Collared Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Gactornis enarratus,https://ebird.org/species/colnig1,"Beautifully patterned cryptic nightjar. Found mainly inside of eastern and northern Madagascar rainforest, though very locally in dry forest. Most often seen when located by local guides, sleeping on the forest floor during the day, usually below a pandanus. Apparently completely silent, which is bizarre for a member of the nightjar family. When perched, distinguished from Madagascar Nightjar by its rufous collar; in flight, by its lack of white in the wings."
0,Collared Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Taenioptynx brodiei,https://ebird.org/species/colowl1,"A tiny brown owl of mountains and foothills; descends into valleys and lowlands during the winter. Appears in both rufous and gray morphs, both dark above and white below with long, distinct streaks on the flanks. Tooting song, often given during the day, can be mistaken for that of a barbet, but the Collared Owlet song has four discrete notes, with the second and third notes given close together."
0,Collared Palm-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cichladusa arquata,https://ebird.org/species/copthr1,"Odd and distinctive thrush. Note the gray head, pale eye, rufous back, and black mark outlining the throat. Found locally in thickets within palm savanna. Distinctive song consists of an emphatic series of airy, wailing notes. Also gives chattering and rasping calls. Spotted Morning-Thrush is similar, but Collared is separated by its pale eye, bright rufous back, and lack of spotting below. Somewhat similar to nightingales and scrub-robins, but easily separated by its black throat markings."
0,Collared Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma brevipes,https://ebird.org/species/colpet1,"A small gray-and-white petrel with a dark hood, a bold dark “M” pattern across the upperwings, and a distinctive bold black underwing pattern. Very variable. A pale morph resembles Gould’s Petrel, while a distinctive sooty-brown dark morph shows exceptionally bold underwing markings. Pale morph separated from Gould’s Petrel by its much bolder underwing pattern and its hood, which often meets below the neck, creating a full collar. Silent at sea."
0,Collared Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius collaris,https://ebird.org/species/colplo1,"Uncommon, petite plover of beaches, coastal lagoons, lakeshores, gravel bars, and sandbars along rivers. Note slender black bill, brightly patterned head, narrow black breast band, and long pinkish legs. Despite the name, does not have white collar around back of neck like most small plovers. Typically found in pairs or as single birds; not in flocks like many other small plovers. At high tide they often roost with other plovers such as Wilson’s and Semipalmated plovers."
0,Collared Pratincole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Glareolidae,Glareola pratincola,https://ebird.org/species/colpra,"Elegant, agile flier that looks like a cross between a plover and a swallow. Adult is warm gray-brown with an elegant “necklace” and red bill base. Juvenile is grayer, with white-fringed feathers. Very narrow (sometimes unnoticeable) white trailing edges to wings and dark rusty underwings distinguish this species from similar pratincoles. Usually seen in buoyant flight over open country, from dry fields to grassy wetlands with muddy shorelines. Inconspicuous on the ground; note short-legged and very long-winged “horizontal” profile. Feeds mainly in flight, sweeping back and forth like a giant swallow to snatch aerial insects."
0,Collared Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Bucco capensis,https://ebird.org/species/colpuf1,"Distinctive medium-sized rainforest bird, easily recognized by large, mostly bright cinnamon head and orange bill, whitish underparts, and clean black band completely encircling nape and breast. Inhabits lower and middle levels of tall rainforest, sometimes up to the canopy, where it sits motionless before making sudden flights to bark, foliage, or ground for large insects and small vertebrates. Encountered singly or in pairs, but rather seldom seen due to lethargic behavior. Typically silent during the day; song—given well before first light—is a wild-sounding series of quavering notes that is unlike that of any other bird."
0,Collared Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus lettia,https://ebird.org/species/cosowl1,"Medium-sized owl with significant variation in plumage and vocalizations across its large range. Either gray or brown in coloration, with prominent pale ear tufts and pale face outlined in black. Fond of open wooded habitats from lowlands to foothills, often found roosting in temples, houses, and gardens, particularly in rural areas. Larger and more strongly tufted than both Oriental and Mountain Scops-Owls; both also lack the black facial border. Listen for this species’ incisive, short hoots, given at well-spaced intervals (often around 10 seconds)."
0,Collared Sparrowhawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter cirrocephalus,https://ebird.org/species/colspa1,"Small, delicately-built gray raptor with orange barring on chest and belly. When soaring, tail-tip is notched when not fanned out. When perched, look for a tiny bill, blank-staring expression (no heavy brow), and very skinny legs. Much less likely to circle high in sky than Brown Goshawk, and tends to stick to cover."
0,Collared Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Hedydipna collaris,https://ebird.org/species/colsun2,"A tiny, short-billed sunbird with a metallic-green back and a yellow belly. The male has a green throat and a narrow purplish breast band; the female is duller, with a yellow throat and no breast band. Pairs frequent forest edge, woodland, and savanna, where they join mixed-species flocks to glean leaves and hover to catch insect prey. But they will also feed on fruit and nectar, often by piercing the base of a flower and sucking out nectar without pollinating. The “yellow-bellied” races of Variable Sunbird differ from Collared Sunbird by being larger, with a longer bill and broader purple-blue breast band."
0,Collared Towhee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Pipilo ocai,https://ebird.org/species/coltow1,"Large, brightly patterned sparrow endemic to highlands in south-central Mexico. Found in brushy understory, flower banks, and overgrown fields in pine-oak and pine-evergreen forest. Rather skulking, but often feeds along field edges or quiet roadsides, especially early and late in the day; sings from bushes and low trees, but often quite hidden. Note the boldly striped head, rusty cap, and bright white throat contrasting with a broad black collar. Varied calls and songs are often loud, unlike high-pitched vocalizations of rather similar Chestnut-capped Brushfinch."
0,Collared Treepie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Dendrocitta frontalis,https://ebird.org/species/coltre1,"Like many other treepies, this is a noisy, social bird, often seen in flocks moving through the canopy and through openings in the forest. Extensively black face, silver hood, and lack of a wing patch distinguish this species from other treepies in its range. Inhabits forests from the lowlands up to montane areas. Loud, with a varied repertoire of whistles, clinks, and squawks."
0,Collared Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Trogon collaris,https://ebird.org/species/coltro1,"Relatively small, red-bellied trogon of humid forest in tropical lowlands and foothills. Perches at all levels inside forest, less often at edges. Male’s tail is dark below with narrow white barring; female’s tail is pale grayish below with narrow black-and-white bars at the tips. In most areas, the only other red-bellied trogon in the same habitat is the larger and distinctive-looking Slaty-tailed Trogon."

0,Colombian Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Mustelirallus colombianus,https://ebird.org/species/colcra2,"A shy and poorly known bird of marshes and wet, grassy areas. Gray with a brown back, buffy lower underparts, a yellow bill with an orange base, and red legs. Very similar to Paint-billed Crake, but lacks barring on the lower underparts; this feature is usually very hard to see in the dense vegetation the bird typically inhabits. Almost never encountered in the field, in part due to the fact that next to nothing is known about its voice."
0,Colombian Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps andinus,https://ebird.org/species/colgre1,"Extinct, last reported in 1977. Formerly Andes of Colombia."

A species of mature humid forest and forest edge, often seen in pairs or small flocks flying between or perched up in tall trees. Famed for its wide repertoire: gives a myriad of screams, squeaks, chirps, and whistles. Threatened by its popularity in the cage bird trade."
0,Common House-Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Delichon urbicum,https://ebird.org/species/cohmar1,"Fairly common to common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Breeds colonially under eaves of buildings, where builds mud nests; feeds over varied open and semiopen habitats, especially water bodies and adjacent fields. Distinctive plumage, with blue-black upperparts, big white rump patch, and white underparts; tail fork shallower than on Barn Swallow, and flight jerkier overall, less smooth and graceful. Juvenile in late summer–autumn is duller above, dingier below than adult."
0,Common Iora,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Aegithinidae,Aegithina tiphia,https://ebird.org/species/comior1,"Breeding adult males are black above and rich yellow below with white wingbars. In nonbreeding plumage the upperparts are greenish-yellow, but the wings are still black with white wingbars. The female is similar in appearance to a nonbreeding male. These birds are quite vocal and can produce a wide variety of calls. The most commonly heard is the whistle “twiii tuiii twiiii.” Apart from this, it utters variable “chirrs” and chattering. The song is a trilled “wheeeee-tee.” Common Iora are frequently seen in wooded areas, scrub, and cultivated lands."
0,Common Jery,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Neomixis tenella,https://ebird.org/species/comjer1,"Small, energetic, sharp-billed warbler. Always shows gray on the back of the neck and usually a lightly striped throat, though there is regional variation. Madagascar endemic that is found in all habitats with some woody vegetation, including forest, scrub, savanna, plantations, and villages. Often joins flocks with other small bird species. Song is a squeaky, bouncing series of high notes. Gray on the back of the neck separates it from all other jeries. Larger and brighter than Green Jery. Smaller than Stripe-throated Jery, with pale legs."
0,Common Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Alcedo atthis,https://ebird.org/species/comkin1,"Fairly common but small, often rather shy, and inconspicuous. Beautiful blue-and-orange plumage, in combination with habitat and habits, is basically unmistakable. Found along rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds—almost any fresh or brackish habitat with small fish. Often perches quietly in trees over water; most often seen in very fast low flight as a turquoise flash over the water, usually flying away. Easily detected once its high, shrill whistled call is learned, even if the bird itself is hidden."
0,Common Loon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gaviiformes,Gaviidae,Gavia immer,https://ebird.org/species/comloo,"A large, heavy-billed loon. Common and widespread in North America; somewhat less common and more local in Europe. Breeding adults have gorgeous black-and-white patterning; especially note fully black head with iridescent sheen and boldly checkered back. Nonbreeding plumage is plainer gray above and white below; note the jagged border between gray and white on the neck. Heavy bill is usually held straight (compare with Yellow-billed Loon). Breeds on lakes and ponds in the boreal forest. Listen for their haunting, yodeling vocalizations. In winter, mostly found on nearshore ocean waters and sheltered bays, singly or in loose flocks."
0,Common Merganser,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mergus merganser,https://ebird.org/species/commer,"Large duck with a sleek body and thin red bill. Breeding males have a dark green head and mostly white body with peachy blush on underparts. Females and immature males have rusty brown head and gray bodies with a cleanly demarcated white throat.

0,Common Miner,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Geositta cunicularia,https://ebird.org/species/commin1,"Widespread but often local in open areas typically with sandy soil from Patagonian steppe to coastal dunes to bogs in the high Andes; often less common than other miners in the same areas. Often seen in pairs, walking with a waddling gait and pumping its tail like most miners. Best identified by distinct breast streaking, relatively long and very slightly decurved bill, and (in flight) bright rusty wing patches. Northern populations also have contrasting creamy white rump. Song varies geographically."
0,Common Murre,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Uria aalge,https://ebird.org/species/commur,"Black-and-white seabird with crisp patterning. Dark brownish-black above with white belly. Head entirely dark in breeding plumage; nonbreeding show white face with curved dark line below eye. Sides usually show some messy dark streaks. Bill is longer and more slender than similar Thick-billed Murre; but can be difficult to judge at a distance. Also note browner plumage and streaky sides on Common Murre. Breeds in colonies on rocky islands and cliffs; spends the rest of the year on the ocean. Usually single or in loose small groups; in the Atlantic, sometimes seen in loose association with Razorbills."

0,Common Newtonia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Newtonia brunneicauda,https://ebird.org/species/comnew1,"Energetic and pugnacious little plain-brown vanga. The eye is white, and the center of the chest usually orange. Madagascar endemic that is found in all types of forest. Constantly on the move through the mid-story, usually in pairs. Often joins flocks with vangas and other mid-sized birds. Song is an explosive, rollicking series of two-parted notes: “chi-pu, chi-pu, chi-pu….” Pale eye and paler overall coloration separate it from Dark Newtonia. Pale eye also separates Common Newtonia from the rare Red-tailed Newtonia. Similar to Archbold’s Newtonia, but without rufous around the eye."
0,Common Nighthawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Chordeiles minor,https://ebird.org/species/comnig,"Camouflaged to blend into daytime roosts. Intricately patterned with gray and brown. Often roosts along tree branches or on the ground. Feeds at night on large insects. Watch for them flying under bright lights at ballgames or supermarkets. Distinctive fluttering flight style, with wings usually held in a V-shape between bursts of flaps and maneuvers to snatch insects.

Replaced in northern and eastern Europe by very similar-looking Thrush Nightingale."
0,Common Ostrich,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Struthioniformes,Struthionidae,Struthio camelus,https://ebird.org/species/ostric2,"Massive, conspicuous, flightless bird with long neck and robust legs. Mature males have black-and-white plumage, with pinkish skin, flushed in breeding plumage. Females and immatures are duller gray-brown. Small groups roam open and lightly-wooded country; can walk up to several kilometers a day. The stubby wings are used for spectacular breeding displays and dust-bathing. Deep booming calls can be heard from long distances. Similar Somali Ostrich (no range overlap) has slaty-colored skin and pale eyes, unlike the pink-skinned Common Ostrich."
0,Common Paradise-Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Tanysiptera galatea,https://ebird.org/species/copkin1,"A long-tailed kingfisher of lowland forests. White underparts and rump, dark blue upperparts with pale blue shoulder and crown. Long white tail with 2 extended central tail feathers ending in spatula tips. Sits still for long periods whilst slowly pumping its tail. Very similar to Little Paradise-Kingfisher, but Common Paradise-Kingfisher is larger, with a paler crown, white rather than blue outer tail feathers and a heavier bill. The safest way to separate, however is by vocalization. Heard more often than seen. Song, a rapidly accelerating and slightly rising series of dry notes."
0,Common Poorwill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Phalaenoptilus nuttallii,https://ebird.org/species/compoo,"Small, compact night bird with short wings and tail. Intricately patterned with shades of gray; flight feathers are barred with rufous. Males have white corners on tail, females have browner tail corners.

Prefers rocky desert slopes with some dry vegetation; sometimes perches prominently when singing but also sings from the ground."
0,Common Potoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Nyctibiidae,Nyctibius griseus,https://ebird.org/species/compot1,"Strange nocturnal bird like a mix between an owl and a nightjar. Large head and huge yellow eyes. Overall grayish-brown with splotchy patterning. Black mustache stripe helps distinguish from Great Potoo, along with smaller size. Spends the daytime perched on the end of a snag, where it blends in perfectly and becomes very difficult to spot. At night, hunts mainly for flying insects from an exposed perch. Found in open forested habitats with scattered trees, such as forest edges, along rivers or roadsides, or even in disturbed patchy woodland. Listen for mournful series of whistles, descending in pitch: “POO, POO, Poo, poo, poo.”"
0,Common Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Coturnix coturnix,https://ebird.org/species/comqua1,"Small pear-shaped gamebird. Breeds in taller grassland and grain fields from western Europe east to central Asia and winters in similar habitat in Africa, southern Europe, and South Asia. Rarely seen, and most often detected by male’s emphatic whistled ""wet-my-lips!"" song, which can be given at night. When flushed, explodes from underfoot and flies off strongly with whirring wingbeats and short glides. Plumage cryptic and streaky brown with pale eyebrow; male has black throat stripe. Very similar to Japanese Quail, whose male has a much darker face; females, immature birds, and domestic types (kept as captive for eggs and can escape) are probably not safely separable in the field."
0,Common Raven,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus corax,https://ebird.org/species/comrav,"Large, glossy-black bird with a wedge-shaped tail. Larger than a crow with a longer, thicker bill. Distinctive shape in flight, with rather long, swept-back wings and long tail. Note smoother, steadier wingbeats compared with faster, choppier wingbeats of crows. Extensive range throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Found in a wide variety of habitats, including desert, coniferous forest, coastlines, sagebrush, tundra, and grasslands. Often solitary or in pairs, but can gather in small groups. Typical call is a loud, guttural croak, but makes an astonishing variety of other strange noises. Compare with Chihuahuan Raven in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico."
0,Common Redpoll,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Acanthis flammea,https://ebird.org/species/comred,"Small finch fond of colder climates.

0,Common Redshank,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa totanus,https://ebird.org/species/comred1,"Stocky brown wader with bright red legs; compare with slenderer, far more gracile Spotted Redshank in juvenile and non-breeding plumage. Often rather wary, alerting other birds with its loud, fluty, whistled calls. Bobs tail when nervous, and then flies to show flashy white trailing edge to wings, white rump patch. Feeds in muddy shallows, probing and picking with its bill. Inhabits fresh and coastal wetlands; also breeds on moorland, usually near water."
0,Common Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Phoenicurus phoenicurus,https://ebird.org/species/comred2,"Fairly common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Found in mixed and deciduous woodland, heathland with trees and hedges; often uses scrubby coastal habitats during migration. Unobtrusive; tends to perch rather upright and has distinctive habit of shivering its bright orangey tail. Male handsome and distinctive, with black face and throat offset by white brow, bright orangey breast, blue-gray back. Female drab gray-brown overall except for bright tail. Female told from female Black Redstart by warmer, buffy-brown (not grayish) breast."
0,Common Ringed Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius hiaticula,https://ebird.org/species/corplo,"Stout shorebird with a stubby bill. Note orange legs, often bright on spring adults. Breeding plumage has bold black-and-white head and breast pattern; nonbreeding has subdued and browner pattern. Bill is bright orange with a dark tip when breeding, dark otherwise. In flight shows bold white wing stripe. Mellow whistled “poo-ee” call quite distinct from call of more slender and ""spectacled"" Little Ringed Plover. Breeds on sandy and stony substrates from beaches and lakeshores to moorland above treeline. Winters coastally, where often roosts with other small waders such as Dunlin."
0,Common Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus erythrinus,https://ebird.org/species/comros,"Medium-sized, dumpy finch with a stubby bill. Male are distinctive with a red head, breast, and rump, brown eye-mask, and white belly. The amount of red varies with age. Females and juveniles are a rather unprepossessing, uniform brown inviting confusion with female House Sparrows; note the two pale wingbars. Breeds at both low and high elevations in deciduous scrub, meadows, and marsh edges as well as clearings in forest. Far-carrying, whistled, typically 3-note song is memorable."
0,Common Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Actitis hypoleucos,https://ebird.org/species/comsan,"Small bicolored sandpiper which often bobs its tail in a distinctively wagtail-like manner. Plain brown with white underparts; distinguished from bulkier and rounder-headed Green Sandpiper by a prominent white spur at the shoulder. Found in a variety of wetland habitats; breeds on stony ground along rivers and lakeshores, with migrants occurring on muddy and rocky substrates from concrete canal banks to channels in tidal mudflats. Mainly found as singles or in small groups, not in flocks or mixed with other species."
0,Common Scimitarbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Phoeniculidae,Rhinopomastus cyanomelas,https://ebird.org/species/cosbil1,"An elongated matte-black bird with black legs and a slender, strongly-decurved black bill. Females and juveniles are browner on the front. In flight it has white tail tips and a single band of white towards the end of the wing. Avoids forest; singles or pairs are found in arid and broadleaved woodland, where they are found clambering around on trunks, probing for invertebrates, and often joining mixed-species flocks. It is most easily detected by its plaintive, whistled, three-noted “wheeep, wheeep, wheeep” call. The very similar Black Scimitarbill differs from tby having a shorter, less decurved bill and a shorter tail. Abyssinian Scimitarbill has an orange bill. Woodhoopoes are larger, with chunkier reddish bill, more social habits, and glossy iridescent plumage."
0,Common Scoter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Melanitta nigra,https://ebird.org/species/blksco1,"Fairly common sea duck; feeds by diving. Breeds on tundra lakes; winters at sea in coastal bays, estuaries, harbors. Rarely seen inland on fresh water, mainly during migration periods. Occurs locally in flocks of hundreds, but also found as singles and small groups. Male distinctive: wholly black with raised knob at base of bill, yellow wedge on top of bill. Female dark brown overall with pale cheeks. In flight looks all-dark, often flying in rather tight groups low to fairly high over the sea."
0,Common Shelduck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Tadorna tadorna,https://ebird.org/species/comshe,"Distinctive, large, rather gooselike duck of coastal wetlands, tidal mudflats, and nearby grassy fields. Striking plumage often looks simply black-and-white; at close range, head is deep glossy green, broad breast band dark rusty. Male has raised knob at base of red bill; juvenile duller overall, with whitish face and eyering. Less numerous and more local inland at lakes and along rivers. Often seen walking and grazing, at times in flocks."
0,Common Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago gallinago,https://ebird.org/species/comsni,"Fairly common in wetland habitats from damp meadows to saltmarshes. Mostly inconspicuous, feeding in muddy ground by probing with its very long bill, usually near reeds or other grassy cover. Often not seen until flushed, when usually rises from fairly close range with rough rasping call. Breeding birds are more conspicuous, perching on fence posts. Note cryptic, stripy plumage, very long bill. In Asia and Australasia, beware of extremely similar Pin-tailed, Swinhoe's, and Latham's Snipes, all of which lack the white trailing edge of Common and have a slower, less erratic flight. In display flight, birds stoop from high overhead and produce a pulsating, bleating sound from air passing through their fanned tail."
0,Common Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus apus,https://ebird.org/species/comswi,"Almost always seen in flight, which, as the name suggests, is swift. Nests in cavities in cliffs and buildings. Ranges widely over any habitat in search of aerial insects, often over lakes and reservoirs where swallows congregate. Usually flies higher than swallows except when swooping low to drink by splashing briefly on water surface. Bigger and longer-winged than swallows, with dark plumage, strong stiff wingbeats, faster and more direct flight. Lacks the white rump patches of similarly-sized Pacific Swift (and other ""fork-tailed swifts"") and various needletails."
0,Common Tailorbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Orthotomus sutorius,https://ebird.org/species/comtai1,"A common warblerlike bird with a green back, a reddish crown, and a long bill. It gets its name from the way in which it builds its nest by stitching leaves together. A ubiquitous inhabitant of parks, gardens, and wooded areas across South and Southeast Asia. Its loud “tuui-tuui…” and “whee-whee…” calls are often part of the sound of daily life in human habitation. Co-occurs with the very similar Dark-necked Tailorbird in NE India and SE Asia, but is separable by call, and by the lack of a rufous hind-crown, and yellow vent."
0,Common Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna hirundo,https://ebird.org/species/comter,"Medium-sized tern found on open ocean, beaches, and large lakes. Adults have pale gray body and black cap. Bill color differs by subspecies: most have red bill with black tip, but some Asian birds have all-black bills. First-years show dark outer primaries, dark shoulder, and black restricted to back of neck. Similar to Forster's, Arctic, and Roseate Terns. Separated from breeding Forster's Tern by entirely gray upperwings; nonbreeding Forster's shows black ear patch. Somewhat longer-billed and shorter-tailed than Arctic Tern, with paler body. Shorter-tailed and overall darker than gleaming white Roseate Tern. Often found in large flocks, especially in late summer. Gives a harsh screeching call ""KEEE-yurrrr."""

0,Common Wood-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba palumbus,https://ebird.org/species/cowpig1,"Common and conspicuous in wooded and semiopen habitats, including towns and gardens. Forms flocks, especially in winter. Often rather unaware, and frequently crashes noisily and clumsily out of hedges and bushes. Display flight consists of flap-flap-flap climb followed by descending glide. Distinctive, large bulky gray pigeon with big white neck patch (lacking on juvenile in late summer–autumn). Bold white wing band striking in flight; tail broadly tipped black."
0,Common Woodshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Tephrodornis pondicerianus,https://ebird.org/species/comwoo1,"A medium-sized woodshrike with grayish-brown upperparts, black facial mask, white rump, and gray tail with white outer tail feathers. Bill strongly hooked, dark grayish-brown in color. Underparts white. Similar to Malabar Woodshrike and Large Woodshrike, but generally found in drier forests; also note prominent white supercilium. Usually found in dry forested areas and shrublands. Bright, fast-paced song starts out with two strident “wheeet” notes, followed by a descending series of shorter notes. Calls vary, but usually sound like isolated fragments of song."
0,Common Yellowthroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Geothlypis trichas,https://ebird.org/species/comyel,"Small warbler, dull olive overall with intense yellow throat. Adult males have black mask bordered above by a white band. Females and immatures are duller but always have contrasting yellow throat and undertail coverts. Common and widespread breeder throughout North America. Found in shrubby wet areas, including marshes, forest edges, and fields. Often hides in thick vegetation, but males often perch conspicuously when singing. Listen for ringing “witchity-witchity-witchity” song and low, harsh call notes. Very short, rounded wings, which equates to it being a short-distance migrant: winters from the southern U.S. to Central America."
0,Comoros Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/ashcus3,"A medium-sized bird with a gray back, a black hood, and pale underparts. There is an unusual and rare olive morph in which the head and back are olive-gray and the underparts greenish-buff. The juvenile is a drastically different-looking heavily streaked and spotted bird. Found locally in montane forest on the islands of Grand Comoro and Moheli. The most common vocalizations are a descending high-pitched series of soft whistles and a mild, chatty series of “chew” and “tew” notes. Within its small range, most similar to Grand Comoro and Moheli Bulbuls, but easily separated by the paler underparts and lack of an orange bill."
0,Comoros Green-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Treron griveaudi,https://ebird.org/species/madgrp2,"Chunky, medium-sized pigeon that is mostly pale green with black wings and a pale wing stripe. Flight is very fast and direct. Sometimes found alone, though more often in small groups. Widespread but erratic; local abundance linked to the availability of fruit, its main food. Found in humid forest, secondary forest, and plantations. Endemic to the island of Mohéli in the Comoros. Voice is a quiet but maniacal combination of sputters, whistles, and cackles. Easily identified, as it is the only green pigeon within its tiny range."
0,Compact Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Pachyphantes superciliosus,https://ebird.org/species/comwea1,"Has a typical weaver color scheme but an unusual shape: a chunky body, heavy bill, and short tail. Breeding males and females have a black mask, and the crown is yellow in males and black in females. Non-breeding birds are more distinctive than typical non-breeding weavers: buff below, with a dark crown and eye-stripe. Found in wet and grassy microhabitats within savanna, forest, scrub, and cultivation. Usually in small flocks. Along with typical weaver “chit” notes and sizzling, “radio static” song, also often gives a “cheep” call. Superficially similar to other weavers, but separated by distinctive shape."
0,Congo Bay-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Tytonidae,Phodilus prigoginei,https://ebird.org/species/cobowl1,"A medium-sized owl with a heart-shaped face that is mostly rusty-brown with scattered black-and-white spots; bill is yellowish. One of Earth’s rarest birds, it has only been encountered a handful of times in montane Albertine Rift forest with bamboo, including forest edge. Call unknown, but a record of a bird calling similarly to Oriental Bay-Owl and a “wok-wok-wok” reported from Rwanda may be this species. Similar Barn Owl and Grass Owl are larger than Congo Bay-Owl, preferring more open areas."
0,Congo Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Riparia congica,https://ebird.org/species/conmar1,"A typical small martin with brown upperparts, pale underparts, and a diffuse gray-brown breast band. Resident and extremely localized, restricted to the Congo River and a handful of its tributaries, breeding colonially in sandbanks. Despite being fairly common, the species’ vocalizations are unknown. Sand Martin is larger than Congo Martin and has a bolder breast band delineating a white throat; Brown-throated Martin has a dark throat."
0,Congo Moor Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myrmecocichla tholloni,https://ebird.org/species/conmoo1,"An unusual and distinctive Central African chat. Mostly gray-brown with a white throat, rump, and undertail and white wing patches that are conspicuous in flight. Found locally in grassland, usually in pairs or small groups. Hops along the ground or sits up on low perches. Structure and behavior similar to Sooty Chat, but gray-and-white plumage is completely different. The cheerful song alternates higher whistled notes and lower chirruping notes. This song is often given in a hovering display flight."
0,Congo Serpent-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Dryotriorchis spectabilis,https://ebird.org/species/coseag1,"A big-headed but overall medium-sized forest eagle that eats primarily snakes. Can be found at all heights, from the canopy down to near the ground. The long banded tail, brown back with a rufous hind-collar, white breast, and barred flanks make this species unique within its range. Western birds have white throats, while eastern birds have black-spotted throats. Frequently heard calling in the forest, uttering a long series of “HOW, how, HOW, how” caws that are reminiscent of a hornbill. Throughout range, co-occurs with the similar-looking Cassin’s Hawk-Eagle, but Congo Serpent-Eagle is smaller, has a black line down the center of the throat, and appears bigger-headed."
0,Congo Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris congensis,https://ebird.org/species/consun2,"A slim, long-billed sunbird in which males and females are very different. Males are mostly black and dark green, with a red band across the underparts and extremely elongated central tail feathers. Females are very plain, gray-brown above and paler below. A localized and poorly known species that is found in rainforest along the banks of large rivers. Similar to Orange-tufted Sunbird, but male has a red rather than purple breast band and an elongated central tail, and the female is even plainer. The female is also similar to female Green Sunbird, but is longer-billed. The voice is unknown."
0,Connecticut Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Oporornis agilis,https://ebird.org/species/conwar,"Large, skulky, seldom-seen warbler. Lemon-yellow below and olive-brown above with a gray hood and complete white eyering. Female slightly duller than male. Immature has brownish hood, not gray, and is usually duller yellow below.

Especially look for weedy fields at the edge of forest, often with dense thickets, goldenrod, and jewelweed. A late spring migrant; in fall, mostly departs the U.S. by early October and flies nonstop to South America, but wintering range is not well-known. Compare with Mourning Warbler and immature Common Yellowthroat; look for Connecticut’s complete white eyering, large size, long undertail coverts, and habit of walking instead of hopping."
0,Cook Islands Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus kerearako,https://ebird.org/species/cirwar2,"A slender warm-toned reed warbler, olive-brown above with darker wing feathers and mostly yellowish-white below.

When perched, immature is most easily told from Red-tailed Hawk by its boldly patterned head. In flight, note the Cuban Black Hawk's much broader wings and shorter tail.. Call is a loud, squeaky “weet-WEET-whew” or “weet-WEET-whew-puh;” also gives a harsh scream."
0,Cuban Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Ptiloxena atroviolacea,https://ebird.org/species/cubbla,"A vocal, gregarious inhabitant of many habitats, although avoids dense woods; often found near human habitation. Note the glossy purple-black plumage, medium-length squared tail, and somewhat thick bill. Similar species include Shiny Cowbird, Red-shouldered Blackbird, and Greater Antillean Grackle. The male Shiny Cowbird is smaller, shorter-billed, and has even glossier plumage than the Cuban Blackbird. The Greater Antillean Grackle has pale (not dark) eyes, a narrower bill and a longer tail. The female Red-shouldered Blackbird is a bit smaller with a narrower bill, and is less glossy. Vocalizations include “schee-o” and a loud “chuck,” both metallic and given singly or in series. Also common is a “chok, chok, chok, lee, lee, lee.”"
0,Cuban Bullfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Melopyrrha nigra,https://ebird.org/species/cubbul1,"A small flocking species of brushy and wooded habitats. Note the large, stout bill and the white slash along the front of the folded wing. Color ranges from black to gray, depending on location and sex. No similar species occurs in its range. Its song is a buzzy trill that drops in pitch and is followed by thin “tsi” notes, from five to ten, rising in pitch towards end of the series. The call is a high buzzy “tsit.”"
0,Cuban Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus nasicus,https://ebird.org/species/cubcro1,"A large, black gregarious species of open woodlands, palm savannahs, and human settlements (including agricultural areas and garbage dumps) near woodlands; often found in flocks of up to fifty birds. The similar Palm Crow has a much shorter bill with extensive feathering on top. The Palm Crow also has a flat, harsh “raaah” unlike the Cuban Crow’s “whih waaa” call with the first note inflected upward and the second note downward. Cuban Crows also have a number of shrieking and harsh burbling noises."
0,Cuban Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Riccordia ricordii,https://ebird.org/species/cubeme1,"A pugnacious hummingbird that feeds on flowers and insects and is sometimes found flycatching. Inhabits a broad range of habitats. Often tame around humans. The long-tailed male is swathed entirely in iridescent green and has a distinctive red base to the bill, except for a white patch below the belly and a white spot behind the eye. The female is metallic green above, dingy white below, and has a relatively long, forked tail. The female Bee Hummingbird is much smaller, shorter billed, shorter tailed, and is iridescent turquoise above unlike the Cuban Emerald. Female Ruby-throated Hummingbirds have shorter, unforked tails with white on the tail tip. Vocalizations include a prolonged jumbled series of high-pitched squeaks and buzzes and a high-pitched but descending “tsee, tsee, tsee, tse, tse.”"
0,Cuban Gnatcatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Polioptila lembeyei,https://ebird.org/species/cubgna1,"A small, energetic, gray-and-white bird that tends to waggle its long tail. Typically feeds low in dense scrub. Endemic to Cuba and offshore islands. Calls include a repeated “da-JIP,” a rapid squeaky “ji-ji-ji-ji-ji,” and a more classic gnatcatcher “zheee.” Note white face outlined with a thin black line, which readily distinguishes Cuban from Blue-gray Gnatcatcher."
0,Cuban Grassquit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Phonipara canora,https://ebird.org/species/cubgra,"A small flocking bird of scrub and grasslands. Note the dark face (black in males and gray in females) that is surrounded by a swirl of yellow from behind each eye, down the sides of the neck, and across the chest. The male Yellow-faced Grassquit has a passing resemblance, but the throat is yellow and the chest is black. Female Yellow-faced and Black-faced Grassquits are of similar size and color but lack the yellow neck and chest seen on Cuban Grassquits. The call is a sharp musical chip and the song is a rather high-pitched twitter."
0,Cuban Green Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Xiphidiopicus percussus,https://ebird.org/species/cugwoo1,"An attractive, small to medium-sized inhabitant of woodlands including mangroves; typically found in pairs, often on dead or dying branches.

0,Cuban Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne cryptoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/cubmar,"A graceful aerial feeder found over a wide variety of open habitats, especially near water, including marshes and towns. Often chooses exposed perches including power and telephone lines in villages. Commonly found in flocks of up to twenty birds, sometimes mixing with other swallows and martins. The adult male is entirely glossy purple-blue and is inseparable in the field from male Purple Martins. The male Caribbean Martin can be distinguished by its bright white belly. Female and immature Cuban Martins resemble females and immatures of both Purple and Caribbean Martin. Purple Martin in such plumages can be identified by a scaly breast pattern and often fine streaks on the belly, which is lacking on female and immature Cuban Martins. Female Cuban Martins are probably not safely separable from Caribbean Martin, though on average the Cuban Martin has more restricted brown on chest. Note that Caribbean and Purple Martins are not present in this species’ range from March to September, which can help eliminate confusing species. Calls include a harsh “churr,” a buzzy “zwick-zwick,” and a musical buzzy burbling."
0,Cuban Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus melanopsis,https://ebird.org/species/graori2,"A sleek forest bird that sometimes ventures into gardens and parks in search of flowers and fruit; prefers areas with palms. The adult is dressed in black except for its yellow rump and shoulders. No similar species occur within its range. Immatures are largely yellow-green with a tattered black beard and somewhat resemble immature male Orchard Orioles, but the Orchard Oriole is smaller and lacks the Cuban Oriole’s yellow shoulders. Calls include a whistled “tsee-tsoo” and “pit-see-ee-oo,” plus a loud squeaky “spwit.” Full song is fluid series of whistled upslurred and down-slurred notes."
0,Cuban Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacara euops,https://ebird.org/species/cubpar2,"A sleek green bird of forests, forest edges, and palm savannahs. Groups of ten to twenty birds often rapidly disappear upon landing, their plumage melting into the similarly colored foliage. Easily distinguished from other species in its range by its color, slim build, and long pointed tail. In overflight appears green with red on forewing. Flight call is shrill and squeaky; notes of each bird often given singly or in couplets. When perched, calls are typically quiet with a murmuring quality."
0,Cuban Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus caribaeus,https://ebird.org/species/cubpew1,"An active small flycatcher of open woodlands and scrub. It is most similar to Eastern Wood-Pewee and migrant flycatchers of the genus Empidonax; best distinguished from these species by the bold white crescent behind the eye. Often flicks tail upwards once after landing. Its song is “Tswee-ooooooo,” with the first part explosive and the second a lazy descending whistle. On the Bahamas, the song often has two or three quick notes added afterwards. Call is a sharp “peep-peep-peep.”"
0,Cuban Pygmy-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium siju,https://ebird.org/species/cupowl1,"A very small, tame owl of wooded habitats that is active both day and night. Depending on attitude, its staring yellow eyes and prominent arched white eyebrows can impart cuteness or ferocity. Often found perched with tail cocked, and when flushed, typically flies only a short distance on rounded wings. Occurs in two color types, gray and rust. Song is a low whistled “whuh” or “hoo” given in a slow series. Other vocalizations include a high, thin whistled “tsee, tsee-tsee-tsee-tsee-tsee” that grows progressively louder, and a series of high squeaks. No similar species within its range."
0,Cuban Solitaire,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Myadestes elisabeth,https://ebird.org/species/cubsol1,"A medium-sized inhabitant of wet forests in mountains and foothills. Though subtle, its appearance is unique within its range. Note the subdued brown upperparts and soft gray underparts combined with a bold eyering, distinct dark whisker, and white outer tail feathers. Can be mistaken for a flycatcher, as it habitually sits motionless, except for sallies after insects or fruit, but no flycatcher in its range has a similar facial pattern or white outer tail feathers. Famed for its remarkable song, by which it is often first detected; a variable combination of loud shrills and flutelike notes."
0,Cuban Tody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Todidae,Todus multicolor,https://ebird.org/species/cubtod1,"A small, gemlike, woodland species that is usually found in pairs. The rather large head, long bill, and short tail create a unique profile. Also note its shimmering green upperparts and red throat and sides. No similar species occur within its range. It usually hunts from low-to-middle level perches, sitting nearly still before leaping upwards to snatch prey from twigs and leaves. Vocalizations include a loud “chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,” uttered at a rate of about seven to ten notes per second, with each burst consisting of one to ten notes; bursts often come in rapid succession."
0,Cuban Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Priotelus temnurus,https://ebird.org/species/cubtro1,"A splendid medium-sized inhabitant of woodlands; often found in pairs. Its iridescent blue-green back, smooth gray chest, and brilliant red belly easily distinguish it from all other species in range. Usually sits motionless near the middle level of the forest, but when feeding (typically on flowers and fruit) hovers conspicuously. Often found by its loud calls, which are somewhat varied. One common call is a “cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu,” often accelerating; another is a resonant quavering “cu-u-low,” given several times in succession."
0,Cuban Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo gundlachii,https://ebird.org/species/cubvir1,"A small, slow-moving species that favors thickets and brush along forest edges and in scrublands. Typically found in pairs; sometimes joins mixed-species flocks with warblers and other vireos. Cuban Vireos have a “bulging eye” appearance created by the white crescent behind the eye and the dull yellowish spot in front of its eye. Also note its hefty bill, weak wingbars, and dull red eye. The similar Thick-billed Vireo has strong wingbars, a yellow spot in front of the eye, and darker eyes. The song is “chweee-ch-byuuu,” with the first note upslurred and last note downslurred. Its calls include a harsh “zzzhhh.”"
0,Cuckoo-roller,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Leptosomiformes,Leptosomidae,Leptosomus discolor,https://ebird.org/species/cuckoo1,"A large, big-headed, short-legged bird that is very odd in almost every way, especially in the position of the eye near the top of the head. Males have a pale head and underparts and a colorful iridescent back. Females are rufous brown with heavy spotting below. Found in all forest types, and sometimes in adjacent scrub and plantations. Often perches and feeds in the canopy, though rarely on an emergent branch. Males and pairs frequently make soaring display flights, constantly giving incredibly loud and persistent three-part wailing calls. Much larger than Broad-billed Roller, with a dark bill. Looks raptor-like, but has a huge head, small bill, and less powerful wingbeats."
0,Cundinamarca Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria kaestneri,https://ebird.org/species/cunant1,"A rather plain antpitta known only from a small area of Colombia’s eastern Andes, southeast of Bogotá. Plumage is dull brown with small white streaks on the underparts, a slightly paler belly, and a faint eyering. Distinguished from Tawny Antpitta by its much darker plumage, streaked (not scaled) underparts, and habitat preferences. Inhabits cloud forest understory, and mostly stays on the ground, though may come up to a low perch to sing. Song is three short whistles that ascend slightly in pitch."
0,Curlew Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris ferruginea,https://ebird.org/species/cursan,"Medium-sized wader with a long, slightly downcurved bill. Slightly larger than Dunlin, with longer and finer bill, longer legs. In flight note large white rump patch. Breeding plumage deep rusty on head and body (like Red Knot). Non-breeding birds are grayish-brown above with white eyebrows and belly. Juvenile is grayish above with neat scaly feather edgings, whitish below with variable buffy wash on breast.

Dark gray with a reddish-orange crown. Forages singly or in pairs on the ground, not usually associating with other species. Extensive gray coloration and red crown distinguish it from other brushfinches within its range. Listen for its song, an emphatic metallic warble: “tseew, suweet.”"
0,Cyprus Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus cyprius,https://ebird.org/species/eursco3,"A small dark owl, intricately marked with black streaks and fine barring. Bright yellow eyes are set in a pale face ringed with black. The ear tufts can be prominent, especially when seen on a day roost, but sometimes are nearly invisible. Found in open woodlands, orchards, and parks. Active at night, when usually detected by monotonously repeated song, a single plaintive hoot that carries quite well. Within its restricted range, can only be confused with Little Owl, but separated by smaller size, ear tufts, and gray rather than brown overall coloration."
0,Cyprus Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca melanothorax,https://ebird.org/species/cypwar1,"Small, long-tailed Sylvia warbler. Upperparts dark with well-patterned wing feathers. Males have a back hood, similar to Sardinian Warbler, but have heavily barred underparts. Females are plainer below, but always have patterned undertail coverts. Breeds in dense bushes in open Mediterranean scrub on Cyprus only. Winters in desert wadis. Song is a monotonous rattle. Call is a series of sharp, metallic “tzeck- tzeck- tzeck” notes."
0,Cyprus Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe cypriaca,https://ebird.org/species/cypwhe1,"Endemic breeder to Cyprus. Similar to Pied Wheatear, but smaller and more delicate. Males are black and white with some dark markings on central crown and often buff or even brighter orange underparts.

There is considerable geographical variation in the amount of black on the crown, throat, and breast band and in the color of the belly, which can be yellow or white. Found on and near the ground in savanna habitats with termite mounds, usually in pairs and small groups. The song is a phrase of three or four notes repeated over and over, often given as a duet. Separated from Yellow-breasted Barbet by the heavily speckled face, and from Red-and-yellow Barbet by the lack of red on the head."
0,Dalmatian Pelican,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Pelecanidae,Pelecanus crispus,https://ebird.org/species/dalpel1,"Massive pelican with a disheveled appearance. Dirty white overall with a scruffy, upswept crest and black primaries (prominent only in flight). Adult has a bright orange pouch during the breeding season, yellow in the nonbreeding season. Can be confused with Spot-billed Pelican and Great White Pelican, but has a combination of pale iris, clean bill with no spotting, and gray legs. Frequents rivers, extensive wetlands, and estuaries, often in large flocks."
0,Damar Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula henrici,https://ebird.org/species/damfly1,"Male is distinctive, small and largely black with fine white streaks on underparts, a white chest spot, a short white brow, and a pale base to undertail. Female is olive above and buffy below, with a more richly colored throat and a short, bold buffy brow. Immature male resembles female, but has streaked underparts and rufous-edged feathers on upperparts. Singles and pairs inhabit lower understory of lowland forest. Confined to Damar island. Thin, high-pitched calls include “tzit-tzit-tzit.” Gives a short song, “tzeee-tzeeee-tzooo” or “tzeeee-tzoooo,” the first note or two higher in pitch."
0,Damara Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sternula balaenarum,https://ebird.org/species/damter2,"A very small, short-tailed tern of coastal waters. It often flies slowly on rapidly-beating wings with its head angled downwards, before hovering and plunge-diving to catch small fish. When breeding, it has a complete black skull cap and bill; when not breeding the front of the forehead turns white. It breeds on barren gravel plains and dunes but is most frequently encountered foraging over estuaries, lagoons, and near shore. Its strident “tsit-tsit” call is higher-pitched than those of other terns. In non-breeding plumage, the very similar Little Tern has contrasting paler rump and tail, while Damara Tern’s back, rump, and tail are all the same shade of pale gray."
0,Cloud-scraping Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola dambo,https://ebird.org/species/clscis1,"Small cisticola that is pale and buffy below, and dark on the back. The crown, back of the neck, and back are heavily streaked. Found in seasonally flooded grassland. A high-pitched, multi-note piping song is given on the wing in a flight display. Very similar to Wing-snapping and Pale-crowned Cisticolas, but longer-tailed than both, and further distinguished from Pale-crowned in breeding plumage by the streaked crown. Also similar to Zitting and Desert Cisticolas, but has a different voice, and is darker on the back."

0,Dark Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis crypta,https://ebird.org/species/darbat1,"Males have the typical batis pattern of black, white, and gray. Females have a more unusual pattern, with rufous in the wing, rufous on the throat, and a variable amount of rufous on the breast. Both sexes have orange or reddish eyes. Found at middle levels and in the canopy of forest at low and middle elevations, often in pairs. Very similar to Short-tailed Batis, but there is no known overlap in range. Males are similar to Chinspot and Pale Batises, but are distinguished by the darker eye and shorter tail. Females are distinctive. The song is variable, but is usually a long, slow series of identical low-pitched tooting notes, sometimes given along with raspy “chugaree” calls."
0,Dark Chanting-Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Melierax metabates,https://ebird.org/species/dacgos1,"A tall, long-tailed, slaty-gray hawk with pink-orange legs and bill base. The flight feathers and wing tips are dark on both the upper and under wings, creating a uniformly dark wing pattern in flight. Pairs inhabit broadleaved woodland and well-wooded savanna. Chanting-goshawks give a strong, gull-like “kleeeu” call, hence their name. Dark Chanting-Goshawk always has a gray-barred rump, while other chanting-goshawks are paler, prefer drier habitats, and have unbarred white rumps. Eastern Chanting-Goshawk has yellow skin at the base of the bill. Pale Chanting-Goshawk has pale inner flight feathers and dark wing tips, creating a very contrasting wing pattern."
0,Dark Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus lugubris,https://ebird.org/species/darpew1,"The only all-dark crested flycatcher in range. Entirely sooty-gray, only slightly paler on throat and belly. More obvious crest than other pewees. Sexes alike. Usually seen singly, perched conspicuously at the forest edge or in a clearing. Listen for “pip” call notes."
0,Dartford Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca undata,https://ebird.org/species/darwar1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common in dense scrubby habitats, especially heathland with gorse. Skulking and difficult to see well, although when singing in spring may perch atop a bush, the long tail often held slightly cocked. Plumage rather dark overall, grayish above and dull wine-red below; note narrow red eyering and fairly bright yellowish legs. No similar species in most of its range."
0,Darwin's Nothura,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothura darwinii,https://ebird.org/species/darnot1,"Quail-like tinamou found in a variety of open habitats including grassland, farmland, and steppe. It occupies high elevations in the northern part of its range, but can be found down to near sea level at its southern limit. Small size (compared to most tinamous) and buff belly and streaks help to identify it. Very similar to Spotted Nothura, and in the area of overlap it is usually not possible to separate them in the field; in this region Darwin’s Nothura tends to be found at higher elevations. Vocalizations include a long, ringing trill and a slow series of piping notes."
0,Daurian Jackdaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus dauuricus,https://ebird.org/species/daujac1,"Small stout crow; often seen in large flocks, sometimes with other crows.

0,Davison's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus intensior,https://ebird.org/species/davlew1,"Small, brightly-colored leaf warbler. Yellowish green above and pale below, with bright yellow brow stripes, a pale crown stripe, and a bicolored bill (dark above, orange below). Has two wingbars, of which upper can be quite pale or absent. Note white undertail and distinct behavior of flicking both wings at the same time (Blyth’s, Claudia’s, and Hartert’s leaf warblers flick their wings alternatingly). More extensively yellow and with a stronger, more contrasting head pattern than Blyth’s and Emei leaf warblers, and lacks the bright rump patch of “Pallas’s-type” leaf warblers. Closely related Kloss’s Leaf Warbler is extremely similar; look for Davison’s brighter and more extensively white undertail coverts. Breeds in deciduous broadleaved and mixed hill and montane forest; descends into forested foothills in the non-breeding season. Song is short and sweet: “wih-chew-chee wih-chew-chee-wih”. Calls are high and liquid-sounding: “chew-wee” or “wit-chew-wee”."
0,Dead Sea Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer moabiticus,https://ebird.org/species/desspa1,"Small and compact with a small bill and a shorter tail compared to larger sparrows. Males have a gray head, a vivid rusty shoulder patch, a black throat, and a yellow patch at the base of the white mustache. Females are relatively clean-looking compared to males. Song is a series of high-pitched, sharp “tzip-tzip-tzip…” notes. The flight call is higher-pitched than larger sparrows.

Most of body brown with buffy streaks (tear-shaped on underparts). Rich chestnut on chin, wings, rump, and tail. Sexes similar. Locally common and often in pairs, found from understory to canopy in riverine forest where often climbs trunks like a woodcreeper. Voice is an explosive group of short notes, mostly in duet. Similar to Orinoco Softtail (no range overlap), which is less streaked and has a buff eyebrow; Rusty-backed Spinetail is unstreaked. Endemic to the Orinoco River of northeastern Venezuela."
0,Demoiselle Crane,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Anthropoides virgo,https://ebird.org/species/demcra1,"Small gray crane of open expansive habitats. Adult is an elegantly smooth shade of gray with a black neck, fiery eyes, and pure white plumes extending out from behind the eyes. Juvenile is similar but paler overall and with shorter plumes. Dark wingtips, prominent while the bird is in flight, may cause confusion with Gray Heron, but note overall shape and straight-necked flying posture (heron typically tucks neck in). Small size distinguishes this species from other cranes. Inhabits fields, deserts, steppes, and plains with water in general vicinity. May visit drier habitat in winter. Migrates in large, vocal flocks."
0,Denham's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Neotis denhami,https://ebird.org/species/stabus1,"A large-to-medium-sized bustard with a chestnut nape and hind neck, and pale gray fore neck. The grayish head has distinct black-and-white crown stripes. Female and juvenile are smaller than male. Pairs and small groups march purposefully in grassland, wooded savanna, and fallow cereal fields, foraging on plants and small animals. It is a partial migrant, moving with the rains. The much larger Kori Bustard has a barred, grayish neck; Ludwig’s Bustard has a gray-brown fore neck, rather than pale gray fore neck of Denham’s Bustard."
0,Des Murs's Wiretail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Sylviorthorhynchus desmursii,https://ebird.org/species/demwir1,"Fairly common but heard much more than seen. This demure little brown bird favors bamboo thickets and other dense tangles at forest edge, roadsides, and along streams. Usually in pairs that move quickly through cover, showing only briefly. Plumage is warm brown overall with paler eyebrow and beady dark eye; might suggest a House Wren but plumage lacks barring, and identified easily if long “wiretail” streamers are seen, such as when flying across a road or trail."
0,Desert Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola aridulus,https://ebird.org/species/descis1,"Small, pale brown, heavily-streaked cisticola. Plumage is darker in breeding plumage, washed-out in non-breeding plumage. Found in dry, open grasslands, including open stretches within savanna. Song is a mix of high-pitched peeps, scratchy lower notes, and “tic” notes. Extremely similar to Zitting Cisticola. Best distinguished by song, though subtle plumage differences include Desert’s more uniformly blackish tail and slightly streaked rufous rump."
