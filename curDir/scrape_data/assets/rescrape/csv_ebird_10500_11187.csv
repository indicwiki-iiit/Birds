0,Whitehead's Broadbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Calyptomenidae,Calyptomena whiteheadi,https://ebird.org/species/whibro1,"Magnificent emerald-green giant of a broadbill, with distinctive black mottling and streaking. Males have black streaking on the underparts which females lack. A specialty of Borneo’s central highlands, where it can be found in montane forest with extensive tall pristine growth. Typically seen singly, but occasionally also in pairs or small flocks, especially at fruiting trees. Gives a sharp metallic “tlak!”, followed by a grating rattle."
0,Whitehead's Spiderhunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Arachnothera juliae,https://ebird.org/species/whispi1,"Unique to the Bornean highlands, this remarkable and highly-sought-after spiderhunter, with its bright white streaking and yellow rump, is utterly unmistakable. Forages actively in the canopy, often singly or in pairs, but sometimes with mixed flocks, frequently probing into flowers and mossy vegetation. Gives a clicking nasal call, “bu’chuk-yih-WEEEE”, or just the nasal “WEEEE”."
0,Whitehead's Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus whiteheadi,https://ebird.org/species/whiswi1,"A large and little-known swiftlet found over montane forest. Known from northern Luzon, Negros, and a few mountains on Mindanao, although there are no recent records from Luzon. Hard to identify. Appears large-headed, with pale brown underparts, dark brown upperparts, a dark rump, and a forked tail. Similar to Philippine Swiftlet, but Whitehead’s is larger, with a more bulky-headed appearance. Vocalizations unknown."
0,Whitehead's Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Harpactes whiteheadi,https://ebird.org/species/whitro1,"Breathtaking, thickset trogon found only in Borneo’s north-central mountains. Male is predominantly bright red, whereas the female is mostly tan-orange; both sexes have a broad silverish “apron”, orangish-brown back, dark face, and blue bill and skin around the eyes. Favors damp, well-shaded sections of montane forest, where individuals and pairs sit quietly at mid-levels. Gives a well-spaced series of squeaky hoots."
0,White's Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera aurea,https://ebird.org/species/scathr2,"Burly thrush with brownish upperparts and white underparts; covered with black-edged scaling all over the body. In flight, two bright white stripes visible on black underwings. Feeds solitarily on the ground, usually in or near dense cover; walks instead of hops, moving in a comically jerky manner. Often very approachable. Prefers mid- to high-elevation forests for breeding but regularly found in lowland parks and forests in winter. Compare Scaly Thrush. Song is a high, fluty whistle which fades in and out in a distinctly unbird-like manner."
0,Whooper Swan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Cygnus cygnus,https://ebird.org/species/whoswa,"Immense swan of frigid northern regions; breeds on the tundra, taiga, and steppe and winters in marshy lakes and wetlands, often in wild areas. Fairly straight neck, short tail, and sloping bill distinct from Mute Swan; told from smaller Bewick’s (Whistling) Swan by larger and pointed yellow patch at base of bill, also lower-pitched and more bugling calls. Juvenile often dingier through first winter than juvenile Bewick’s; juveniles of both usually found with adults as family groups."
0,Whooping Crane,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Grus americana,https://ebird.org/species/whocra,"Larger, pure white, rare cousin of the Sandhill Crane. One of the tallest birds in North America, striking and unmistakable: brilliant white overall with black wingtips and a red crown and mustache. Male and female similar; juvenile stained cinnamon-brown and lacks red on face. Only a couple hundred individuals left in the wild, but population slowly increasing."
0,Whooping Motmot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Momotidae,Momotus subrufescens,https://ebird.org/species/bucmot3,"Large motmot of lowland forest and edges from eastern Panama to northwestern South America. Green above and warm rufous below, with a black mask bordered by a dazzling cerulean crown. The crown is not solidly blue, but instead has a circular black patch in the middle as if it’s wearing a yarmulke. Like most other motmots, has conspicuous tail racquets. In typical motmot fashion, perches quietly for long periods of time anywhere from the understory to the canopy, occasionally flicking its tail side to side. Gives a low single “whoop” call."
0,Whyte's Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Lybiidae,Stactolaema whytii,https://ebird.org/species/whybar1,"A mid-sized brown barbet with a white line under the eye and white wing patches. Geographically very variable, with differing amounts of lemon yellow on the crown (from completely covered to none), and speckles on the breast. Immature is duller than the adult. Has a darker head, larger wing patches and lower-pitched call than the similar Anchieta’s Barbet. It is a low-density resident in Miombo (Brachystegia) woodland, favoring riverine areas. Calls a nasal “pooh-pooh-pooh” which often reveals its presence."
0,Wild Turkey,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Meleagris gallopavo,https://ebird.org/species/wiltur,"Among the largest birds in North America. The large-bodied, long-legged and small-headed look of a turkey is distinctive. Appears dark from a distance. Often seen in small groups in open fields near woods. Gobbling often audible in the spring and early summer."
0,Wilkins's Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Nesospiza wilkinsi,https://ebird.org/species/wilfin3,"A chunky olive-yellow finch with a hefty grosbeak-like bill. Male typically has a paler base to the bill and female is smaller, duller, and streakier. Uncommon, preferring wooded portions of Nightingale Island, to which it is endemic. Sings a repeated “whut-preeu,” deeper and slower than the song of Nightingale Island Finch; female answers with a whistle. The much smaller and commoner Nightingale Island Finch has a thinner, daintier bill than Wilkins’s and occurs throughout the island."
0,Willard's Sooty Boubou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius willardi,https://ebird.org/species/wisbou1,"Mid-sized bushshrike that is completely black with pale blue-gray eyes. Found in the undergrowth of humid forest at moderate elevations. A skilled skulker that is most often detected by voice. The most distinctive vocalization is a series of four bell-like whistles; also gives low scolding notes. Very similar to Albertine Boubou, but prefers lower-elevation forest and has a pale eye."
0,Willcocks's Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator willcocksi,https://ebird.org/species/wilhon2,"A small honeyguide of forest and forest edge. Has a typical honeyguide appearance, being largely olive-green all over with the brightest green on the wings. Shows a pale belly with a hint of streaking and white outer tail feathers with dark tips. The throat is pale and the face is plain, lacking facial markings. Similar to other honeyguides in the region, but note plain face and distinctive song, which consists of typical honeyguide notes immediately followed by a bill snap, “p-REER-tk!”, sometimes repeated for hours on end and often from dedicated song posts that can be utilized for years."
0,Willet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa semipalmata,https://ebird.org/species/willet1,"Large, stocky shorebird with a distinctive black-and-white wing pattern. Larger than Greater Yellowlegs, smaller than godwits. Overall grayish, with messy dark patterning in breeding plumage. Bill is straight and rather thick, with a paler base. Legs are grayish. Two distinct subspecies. “Eastern” Willet is smaller, darker, browner, shorter-billed, shorter-legged, and strictly coastal. Breeds in saltmarshes from Atlantic Canada to the Gulf of Mexico; migrates early, mostly departing the U.S. in August, and winters almost exclusively on the northern coast of South America. Especially likely to be seen foraging on extensive mudflats, sometimes in flocks. “Western” Willet is larger, paler, grayer, longer-billed, and longer-legged, giving it a more godwitlike appearance. Breeds in marshy grasslands in the Interior West; winters much further north than “Eastern” Willet, from both coasts of the U.S. to as far south as Chile. Especially likely to be seen on beaches."
0,Williamson's Sapsucker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Sphyrapicus thyroideus,https://ebird.org/species/wilsap,"A boldly patterned woodpecker of mountain forests with mix of conifers and aspen. Male is striking: mostly black with bold white wing patch, two white stripes on face, red throat, and yellow belly. White rump is conspicuous, especially in flight. Female has a brown head and intricate black-and-white barring on the body and wings; the yellow belly can be hard to see. Typically occurs singly or in pairs, often foraging inconspicuously. Moves to lower elevations in migration and winter, occurring in a variety of wooded habitats, often with oaks and conifers. Staccato drumming like other sapsuckers, starting out fast and slowing down with uneven tempo. Also listen for various other rasping calls."
0,Williams's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra williamsi,https://ebird.org/species/willar1,"A small, compact lark with variable dark- to rusty-brown upperparts, sometimes with darker streaks or feather centers, pale eyebrows and throat, and a pale belly that contrasts with the heavily streaked chest, often washed rufous. The tail is brownish with white outer feathers that are conspicuous in flight. Restricted to a very specific habitat, rocky lava-strewn plains in semi-desert, in two areas of Kenya. Vocalizations are poorly known, but a loud “tsireet” has been recorded during the display flight. Other similar larks are generally less rusty and less streaked on the chest."
0,Willie-wagtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura leucophrys,https://ebird.org/species/wilwag1,"Large black-and-white songbird with fine bill and long legs. Black above, white below, with narrow white eyebrow. Similar Restless Flycatcher has white chin, no white eyebrow, and more peaked crown. Inhabits parks, farms, and grasslands, where often perches prominently, flicking the tail from side to side and giving a pleasing “chitit-chitit-chitit” call."
0,Willis's Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacroides laeta,https://ebird.org/species/wilant1,"Small, perky antbird. Males are slate-gray with an often-concealed white patch on their backs and narrow white tail tips (lacking in the western subspecies). Females have an olive-gray back and are tawny-buff below. Found at the forest edge and in second growth, where it forages in pairs in the understory and is not normally associated with mixed-species flocks or army-ant swarms. The similar Dusky Antbird has a white tipped tail in the area of overlap with the western subspecies. The song is easy to recognize, a sharp, high, positively joyful “puh-wéedi-wéedi-wéedi-wéedi.”"
0,Willow Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax traillii,https://ebird.org/species/wilfly,"Small flycatcher, extremely similar to several other species. Prefers shrubby open areas, especially around marshes. Western population prefers understory in riparian woods. Brownish above and pale below with barely any eyering. Wings dark with distinct white wingbars (brownish in Western population). Nearly identical to Alder Flycatcher; once considered the same species. Also compare with Least Flycatcher, which is very similar but has slightly shorter wingtips and a bolder eyering. Willow is larger, larger-headed, and longer-billed than other species of small flycatcher in the West; also note lack of a distinct eyering. Best identified by voice: song is a sneezing ""FITZ-bew""; call is a dry ""whit."" Silent birds, especially in migration, often best left unidentified."
0,Willow Ptarmigan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lagopus lagopus,https://ebird.org/species/wilpta,"Plump, chickenlike bird often found near willows; also resides in more open tundra. Plumage changes throughout the year. In winter, both sexes are pure white with black outer tail feathers. As summer progresses, male develops rich rufous head and neck and brownish back; in winter, lacks black eyeline shown by Rock Ptarmigan. Summer female is paler golden-brown with intricate black and white markings. Female nearly identical to Rock Ptarmigan; look for slightly thicker bill. Female distinguished from White-tailed Ptarmigan by warmer plumage in summer and black outer tail feathers. Also note habitat differences of White-tailed. Vocalizations include a comical nasal chuckle and various clucking notes."
0,Willow Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile montanus,https://ebird.org/species/wiltit1,"Fairly common to uncommon (scarce and declining in U.K.) in coniferous and mixed forest, birch woodland, willow and alder scrub. Often in scrubbier habitats than Marsh Tit; sometimes visits feeders. Very similar to Marsh Tit, and often best separated by voice. On Willow Tit, note pale wing panel (vs. rather plain wings of Marsh), slightly larger and messier black bib, brighter buffy flanks."
0,Willow Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus trochilus,https://ebird.org/species/wlwwar,"Fairly common to common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Found in wooded habitats, from mixed forest to willow thickets in open country. Looks very much like a chiffchaff, and best identified by voice: song is pleasant, slightly descending warble, very different from song of chiffchaff. Compared to chiffchaff, Willow Warbler is often brighter, more yellowish (especially in autumn) with stronger pale eyebrow, pinkish legs, and tends not to habitually dip its tail. However, many birds seen are best left unidentified."
0,Wilson's Indigobird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Vidua wilsoni,https://ebird.org/species/pawind1,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Bar-breasted Firefinch. Breeding males are glossy purplish-black with a pale brownish panel in the wings, while females and non-breeding males are brown and streaky on the back and pale below, with a bold facial pattern. The bill is white and the legs pinkish. Found in a wide variety of open habitats including open woodland, thickets, savanna, cultivated areas, and scrub. Breeding males can be identified with care by their vocalizations and purple gloss. Non-breeding males and females cannot be separated visually from other indigobirds. Imitates the vocalizations of its host firefinches: a low “chip” call and an up-and-down twittering song."
0,Wilson's Phalarope,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Phalaropus tricolor,https://ebird.org/species/wilpha,"Slender shorebird known for spinning frantically on water to stir up small invertebrates. Note needle-thin bill, longer and thinner than other phalaropes. Breeding females are brighter and more contrasting than males: note gray cap, peachy-orange neck with broad black stripe, and gray-and-rufous back. Males are duller with plainer grayish-brown upperparts and a less distinct dark neck stripe. Nonbreeding birds are very pale gray above and white below with a rather plain face and yellowish legs. Juveniles show crisp buffy edges on wing feathers. Prefers shallow ponds, marshes, and lakes, sometimes in large flocks. Can mix with Red-necked Phalarope; Wilson’s is larger, lankier, and longer-billed. Feeds frantically, more often on land than other phalaropes. Never on the open ocean. Most common in western North America; uncommon to rare in the east. Winters as far south as Tierra del Fuego."
0,Wilson's Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius wilsonia,https://ebird.org/species/wilplo,"Large black bill is diagnostic. Slightly larger than similar plovers, with large blocky head. Breeding plumage shows thick black band across breast, white forehead, and bolder face pattern; nonbreeding birds show less contrast. Legs dull pinkish. Found on sandy beaches, usually singly but sometimes in small loose flocks. Medium-brown upperparts similar but slightly paler than Semipalmated Plover, notably darker than Snowy or Piping."
0,Wilson's Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago delicata,https://ebird.org/species/wilsni1,"Plump, well-camouflaged shorebird that blends into wet meadows and marshes. Dark and heavily marked, with pale buffy stripes on back and face. Extremely long bill used to probe into mud for invertebrates. Similar in shape to American Woodcock but much darker with extensive markings on underparts. Fairly common and widespread throughout North America, wintering to northern South America. Found in muddy wetlands, flooded fields, and marshes, usually singly but sometimes gathering in loose groups. When flushed, listen for rough call note. On breeding grounds, watch and listen for aerial flight display, given day and night: a rapid series of hoot-like noises produced by the outer tail feathers in flight."
0,Wilson's Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Oceanitidae,Oceanites oceanicus,https://ebird.org/species/wispet,"Small and fluttery. Dark blackish-brown overall with even-width white rump patch and conspicuous pale wing panels. Long legs extend past the tail in flight; difficult to spot unless close. Frequently hovers and patters feet on surface of water when feeding. Most often seen in small, loose groups; sometimes feeds or rests on the water in a dense flock. Eats plankton from the surface of the water. Vexed taxonomy might include several cryptic species. Breeds in Antarctica and islands in the southern oceans. Ranges across all oceans when not breeding, mainly from May to October, typically staying offshore but sometimes seen from land. Most common in North Atlantic."
0,Wilson's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Cardellina pusilla,https://ebird.org/species/wlswar,"Small, active, bright yellow warbler. Most birds (adults of both sexes and young males) have a black cap; young females lack this feature. Also note the rather long, narrow tail that is actively flipped around while foraging. Extensive breeding range across northern and western North America; more common in the west than east. Prefers dense thickets, especially with willows and alders. Winters primarily in Mexico, extending as far south as Panama. Migrants and wintering birds are found in any brushy wooded habitat. Listen for husky chip notes. Compare with Yellow Warbler, but note Wilson’s is smaller, smaller-billed, and has a relatively longer, thinner tail."
0,Winding Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola marginatus,https://ebird.org/species/wincis3,"Relatively colorful, mid-sized, long-tailed cisticola of wetlands. Note the brown back with thick black streaks, rufous on the wing and cap, and whitish underparts. Shows geographical variation in overall richness of color, including rufous cap and wing patch. Found in wetland habitats, especially reedbeds, and locally in wet scrub. Song varies across the range. Most populations give a high, rising trill. Some sing with rough “chyup” notes. Similar to Levaillant’s Cisticola, but Winding has a gray or brown tail and an unstreaked rump. Relatively bold colors separate the two from other cisticolas."
0,Winter Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Troglodytes hiemalis,https://ebird.org/species/winwre3,"Tiny, short-tailed, plain-brown wren with a huge voice. Subtly patterned, with indistinct pale eyebrow and diffuse dark barring on flanks and wings. Constantly keeps tail cocked at an angle. Found in a variety of forested habitats, but always prefers wetter areas with thick tangles, often around treefalls and moss. Darker, smaller, and shorter-tailed than House Wren. Incredibly beautiful song is a long series of musical whistles and trills; an unmistakable and common sound in northern forests. Call is a dry, low ""chimp"" remarkably similar to Song Sparrow."
0,Wompoo Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus magnificus,https://ebird.org/species/wofdov1,"Enormous colorful rainforest pigeon with green upper-wings and back, and a pale gray head. Underwings and belly are bright yellow, with a purple chest. Common in rainforests along the east coast of Australia, as well as New Guinea. Calls frequently with a loud explosive ""Wom-Pooooo""."
0,Wonga Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Leucosarcia melanoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/wonpig1,"Large rainforest pigeon, often found foraging on the ground on stocky pink legs. From behind it presents as a steel-gray bird with uniformly gray wings, back and tail. From the front it shows a white belly, and striking white “V” on the chest. Often heard in the distance, with a loud hooting call repeated roughly twice every second."
0,Wood Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aix sponsa,https://ebird.org/species/wooduc,"Breeding males are stunning with ornate, colorful patterns visible up close; appears dark overall at a distance. Females gray-brown with thin white eyering. Crest on head. Found in wetlands and flooded woods. Flies through trees with exceptional maneuverability, thanks to its long tail. Often shy and quick to flush. Call is a loud, screeching whistle."
0,Woodland Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus nyassae,https://ebird.org/species/woopip1,"Large pipit with a streaked back and buffy outer tail feathers. Found in broadleaf woodland, especially miombo and Zambezi teak. Spends most of its time on the ground, but will perch in trees, especially when flushed up. The song consists of three cheeping notes, repeated over and over. Virtually identical to Long-billed Pipit, but has different range and habitat. Similar to Buffy and Plain-backed Pipits, but has streaking on the back, and found in different habitat."
0,Wood Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa glareola,https://ebird.org/species/woosan,"Medium-sized brownish wader with a white belly, varied pale spotting and spangling on back. In flight shows plain upperwings, square white rump patch. Legs greenish yellow. Breeds in bogs and marshes in open coniferous and mixed forests. Migrants and wintering birds occur in varied wetland habitats, especially with grassy and other vegetation cover. Walks in shallow water, picking with its bill. Mainly found as singles or small flocks, not mixed with other species. Bobs tail when nervous, but not habitually like Common Sandpiper."
0,Wood Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago nemoricola,https://ebird.org/species/woosni1,"A rare and infrequently-seen snipe. Like others of its family, it is cryptically colored and intricately patterned with black, brown, and white. Strong, creamy-white markings on its back are especially striking, both when in flight and at rest. Breeds in wet alpine meadows and bogs and winters in forest pools and marshes. Its high-altitude range distinguishes it from most other snipes except Solitary Snipe, which is much grayer and ‘frostier’ in coloration, especially on the face and back."
0,Wood Stork,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Mycteria americana,https://ebird.org/species/woosto,"Huge, long-legged, black-and-white waterbird, about the size of Great Blue Heron. White body with black flight feathers. Adults have a wrinkly bald head and fairly dark bill; juveniles have paler bill and more messy feathering on head and neck. Bill is thicker and more curved than herons. Forages mainly for fish by moving open bill through water until it feels prey. Found in wetlands, particularly flooded swamps and shallow ponds. Often soars, sometimes with vultures. In Middle and South America, compare with Jabiru, which is even larger than Wood Stork and has entirely white wings."
0,Wood Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Hylocichla mustelina,https://ebird.org/species/woothr,"Boldly patterned thrush is bright rusty-brown above with black spots on the white belly. Smaller than a robin, but larger than Hermit Thrush. Sticks to wooded areas, often hopping on the ground. More often heard than seen: listen for its incredible, flute-like song. Population is declining; winters in Central America."
0,Wood Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus sibilatrix,https://ebird.org/species/woowar,"Uncommon to locally fairly common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Favors shady deciduous and mixed woods, especially with beech and oak. Often rather inconspicuous, feeding high in leafy canopy, but can be located by distinctive song. Slightly larger and longer-winged than Willow Warbler. Plumage subtly distinctive: muted lime green above, silky white below with pale yellow throat and yellow eyebrow."
0,Woodchat Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius senator,https://ebird.org/species/wooshr1,"Very distinctive shrike with a red crown, red neck, and black mask.

0,Woodford's Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus woodfordi,https://ebird.org/species/woorai1,"A very dark short-tailed rail, often appearing entirely black. Dark brown on the wings and back, with black on the neck, head, and underparts. Bill yellowish or gray. Flightless. Occurs in damp lowland grassland and grassy thickets within forest. Sounds include a series of sharp yelping and squealing “kik-kik” noises."
0,Woodhouse's Antpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Parmoptila woodhousei,https://ebird.org/species/wooant1,"A small, slender-billed, warbler-like waxbill that is speckled and barred underneath with a reddish face and throat and a rather uniformly brown crown, back, wings, and tail. Forages in the understory and on the ground primarily for ants, alone or in small groups, sometimes in association with ant swarms and mixed-species flocks. Calls include soft whistled “ptiee” notes and repeated high-pitched descending whistles."
0,Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma woodhouseii,https://ebird.org/species/wooscj2,"Attractive jay of oak woodlands and piñon-juniper forests. Royal blue above with gray-brown back and dirty grayish underparts. Flight style is often distinctive, a series of quick wingbeats followed by a stiff glide. Typically in small groups. Listen for scratchy, nasal calls. Regularly visits backyards and feeders. Most similar to California Scrub-Jay (and once considered the same species), but usually separable by range. Also note Woodhouse’s Scrub-Jay is paler and more washed-out, with only a diffuse blue breast band. Population in central Mexico, often called Sumichrast’s Scrub-Jay, is darker and more contrasty than a typical Woodhouse’s, and might be a separate species."
0,Woodland Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Halcyon senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/wookin1,"A medium-sized, electric-blue-backed kingfisher with a distinctive bicolored bill: red above and black below. Pairs and singles mostly hunt insects in taller dry woodland, riverine forest, and forest edges. Its loud and characteristic call is a high-pitched “tuuui”, followed by a pause and then a trilling, down-slurred “trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr”. Sometimes it advertises by sitting upright, extending its wings to show a bold wing pattern, and calling. Almost all of Africa’s other similar kingfishers have a uniformly red-orange (not bicolored) bill, except the Blue-breasted Kingfisher, which differs by being larger, having a complete pale-blue breast band, and preferring denser lowland rainforest."
0,Woodpecker Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Camarhynchus pallidus,https://ebird.org/species/woofin1,"A drab Galápagos finch with a stretched-out-looking bill. It has tan upperparts and pale whitish or yellowish underparts that may have a small amount of streaking. A small number of birds on San Cristóbal have dark hoods. Stout and elongated bill is pure black on breeding male, partly black on non-breeding male, and pale orange on female. Best identified by bill shape and behavior. It creeps along branches peering around for and probing into cavities, and it sometimes taps like a woodpecker. One of very few tool-using animals, it uses twigs and thorns to extract prey from holes in branches. Found on most islands but absent from Española, Genovesa, Marchena, Pinta, Darwin, and Wolf."
0,Woodward's Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis fratrum,https://ebird.org/species/woobat1,"A cute, dumpy, colorful flycatcher-like bird with a diffuse buff breast that distinguishes it from other batises in its range. The sexes differ: the male has a white wing bar and pale throat; the female has a buffy wing bar and buffy throat. Pairs are restricted to the middle levels and understory of lowland and coastal forest and their edges. The species actively hover-gleans for insects, often near the ground, occasionally noisily snapping its bill. Forages solitarily or in mixed-species flocks, where its presence is revealed by the male delivering repeated piping “weeeeooo” calls and the female answering with a croaky buzzing “krej-krej-krjjer.”"
0,Worthen's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Spizella wortheni,https://ebird.org/species/worspa,"Very local, scarce, and endangered small sparrow of desert plateau in northeast Mexico. Mainly found in rolling, short-cropped grassland (especially prairie-dog towns), with scattered yuccas and junipers.

Both sexes are black with snow-white tails. The male has a yellow face and throat patch, while the female has a red patch of skin around the eye and a blue throat patch. Usually seen in pairs or medium-sized flocks, flying between fruiting trees. Usually the only hornbill in highland areas. Gives loud hoarse trumpeting croaks, often while in flight. As with many other large hornbills, wings create a powerful thrumming when flying."
0,Wrenthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zeledoniidae,Zeledonia coronata,https://ebird.org/species/wrenth1,"A strange little understory bird, unmistakable if seen well. Plump and very short-tailed, like a small antpitta or wren. Mostly gray with olive back; most distinctive feature is orange crown. Sexes alike. Found in high-elevation forests from 1500m to treeline, often around bamboo, and always close to the ground. Listen for high, thin calls."
0,Wrentit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Chamaea fasciata,https://ebird.org/species/wrenti,"A plump, large-headed, brownish bird with an extremely long tail. Plain overall with no distinctive plumage features; look for pale eye and stubby bill. Difficult to see, but often heard giving an accelerating series of hard chip notes.

Most rails are best detected by voice, however calls of the Zapata Rail are poorly described and may not actually pertain to this species."
0,Zapata Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Torreornis inexpectata,https://ebird.org/species/zapspa1,"A handsome species with subtle coloration. Its yellow belly shades to olive sides, and a largely gray face is topped by a rusty crown and met below by black-borded white throat. Often found in pairs low in foliage or on the ground. No similar species occur in its range. Calls include a rapid twittering “ti-ti-ti…,” a high thin, “tzi-tzi-tzi,” and a rapid series of ten or more buzzy trilling notes that descend in pitch and grow softer towards the end."
0,Zapata Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Ferminia cerverai,https://ebird.org/species/zapwre1,"A highly secretive denizen of sawgrass marshes. This small brown bird, with heavy barring above, and a somewhat long, down-curved bill has no similar species within its range. It is most often found by its song: “Tseuu-we-we-we-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu” or variations thereof. The song’s middle notes and/or end notes are sometimes buzzy and the end notes are sometimes given as a trill. Calls include a series of rapid ticks, hard buzzy chips, and a variety of harsh notes."
0,Zappey's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyanoptila cumatilis,https://ebird.org/species/zapfly1,"Very similar to Blue-and-white Flycatcher (breeding grounds do not overlap). Females and juveniles are essentially unidentifiable while on migration unless seen with an adult male, which is radiant, electric blue above and white below, lacking the contrasting black throat and breast of Blue-and-white, instead transitioning more smoothly from blue to white. Pale gray smudging on the flanks, while more difficult to see, can also serve to differentiate the two. Song is a thrush-like series of bright, slightly slurred warbles and whistles. Breeds in submontane mixed forests in northern China; wintering grounds little-known, but presumably at a similar altitudinal range in evergreen forests."
0,Zarudny's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer zarudnyi,https://ebird.org/species/desspa4,"Small, delicate pallid sparrow. Both sexes have pale gray upperparts, a black bib, black lines in front of the eyes (lores), sandy underparts, and large white wing patches. Found in sandy arid habitats and desert scrub."
0,Zebra Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Geopelia striata,https://ebird.org/species/zebdov,"A small, grayish brown dove with dark bars on the breast and back, and bare blue skin around the eye. The call is a rapid series of short “coos,” higher pitched and faster than Spotted Dove. Native to Southeast Asia, but introduced to many islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, French Polynesia, Mauritius, and the Seychelles. It is generally quite abundant throughout both its native and non-native range, especially in urban and suburban areas; typically not found in dense forests."
0,Zebra Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Taeniopygia guttata,https://ebird.org/species/zebfin2,"Small finch with bright orange bill and a distinctive black-and-white “moustache” mark. Adult male gray above, with barred grayish bib, rusty white-spotted flanks, and black-and-white tail pattern. Female smooth gray to buff on the chest and belly; juvenile similar but with a dark gray bill. Inhabits arid inland Australia, where often found in very large flocks."
0,Zeledon's Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Hafferia zeledoni,https://ebird.org/species/zelant1,"A nondescript antbird; male entirely black and female entirely dark brown. Only notable feature is the pale blue skin around the eye on both sexes. Listen for loud song, a series of even whistled notes. Rather large and chunky. Look for the tail being raised and lowered slowly. Typically found in pairs in the dark forest understory, sometimes following a mixed flock or ant swarm."
0,Zenaida Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Zenaida aurita,https://ebird.org/species/zendov,"Local and often rather wary dove of fairly open coastal habitats, such as beach dunes with desert scrub, overgrown fields, town edges. Resembles widespread Mourning Dove of North America, but slightly stockier, with a shorter and squared tail. Feeds on the ground, but most often seen in flight, which is fast and direct, usually rather low over the treetops. Best field mark is the white trailing edge to the inner part of the wing, usually quite distinct in flight."
0,Zenker's Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Melignomon zenkeri,https://ebird.org/species/zenhon1,"An infrequently encountered honeyguide of forests and forest edge. Overall olive-green to green in coloration, with upperparts darker than underparts and the brightest green in the wings. Vent is pale with hints of streaking, and tail has white outer feathers with dark tips. Similar to Cassin’s Honeyguide, but note Zenker’s larger bill, larger size, darker throat, and dark-tipped tail. Overlaps locally with Yellow-footed Honeyguide in Cameroon, but Zenker’s Honeyguide has duskier legs and a darker throat, and where the two overlap, Zenker’s is often found at lower elevations. Vocalizations are little known, but the song apparently consists of repeated typical honeyguide “tjee” notes that slowly rise in pitch before peaking and gradually descending in pitch, given at a rate of 1-2 notes per second for up to 20 seconds."
0,Zigzag Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Zebrilus undulatus,https://ebird.org/species/zigher1,"Small, dark, rarely seen heron of forest. Plumage is entirely gray-brown with fine black vermiculations; young birds sport warmer tones. Occurs at low density in swampy forest, especially along densely vegetated riverbanks and in areas with much standing water. Stays close to cover and forages deliberately, walking slowly on the ground or ambushing prey from low perches, flicking tail continuously. May freeze or fly off awkwardly when startled. Heard more often than seen; song is a muffled hoot, repeated at long intervals, usually given before dawn or at dusk. Combination of small size, dark plumage and forest habitat should clinch identification."
0,Zimmer's Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus zimmeri,https://ebird.org/species/zimtap1,"Distinctive tapaculo of humid montane forest adjacent to treeline and Polylepis forest in the high Andes in NW Argentina and S Bolivia. Striking white throat distinctive from other tapaculos except White-browed, from which it differs by voice and gray (not brown) hind crown. Generally observed in the open more than other tapaculos, often perching on rocks and ground-level vegetation. Song a quick series two dry notes spaced out, then 3-4 quick dry notes: “pik-pik pr-tr-tr”."
0,Zimmer's Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Dendroplex kienerii,https://ebird.org/species/zimwoo2,"Medium-sized, slim woodcreeper with a longish tail and shortish bill. Note the whitish eyebrow. Has a streaked head and upper back. Breast streaks have a triangular shape and dark edges. Inhabits the interior of seasonally flooded forests and forests on river islands; forages at middle levels, often accompanying mixed-species flocks. Sings a fast trill: “tr’r’r’r’r’r’r’r’r’r’r.” The similar, commoner Straight-billed Woodcreeper has a straighter, paler, and thicker bill, shorter tail, and slower song."
0,Zino's Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma madeira,https://ebird.org/species/madpet,"Typical gadfly petrel with long, angular wings, long tail, and rapid, banking flight. Very similar to Fea's Petrel, but slightly smaller and has a smaller bill and a more rounded head. As in Fea's Petrel, underwing is mainly dark, underparts are white, and hood is gray with darker eye-surround. Upperparts gray with darker W-shape across wings and mantle. Breeds on mountaintops in Madeira only. Forages at sea."
0,Zitting Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola juncidis,https://ebird.org/species/zitcis1,"Very small, with distinctive short, rounded tail with conspicuous terminal spots. Body sandy-colored below, streaky above. Breeding males have a dark bill and crown. Found in open grasslands, meadows, and agricultural areas. Most often seen high in the sky uttering its monotonous and repetitive ""tchip…tchip….tchip…"" song in undulating song flight."
0,Zoe's Imperial-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula zoeae,https://ebird.org/species/zoeimp1,"A large pigeon of lowland and foothill forest. Pale gray head, yellow eye and short green tail. Pale pinkish breast and whiteish belly are divided by a distinctive thin, black breast band. Fairly common but not seen too often as it keeps more to the forest interior. Distinguished from all other imperial-pigeons by chest band. Its distinctive call betrays its presence. A long, muffled note followed by a series of chuckles “wooo wuhuhuhu wuhuhuhu”."
