The song begins with a clear series of 4-6 notes and finishes with harsh notes."
0,Rook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus frugilegus,https://ebird.org/species/rook1,"Fairly common in farmland and other semiopen areas with hedges and groups of tall trees, where nests in rookeries. Forages on ground, usually in flocks, and associates readily with crows and jackdaws. Easily passed off as a crow unless you see the diagnostic pale patch at base of bill. Rook calls are higher pitched and less rolling than crow calls. Juvenile lacks pale bill base and is very similar to Carrion Crow, but bill a little more tapered; pale bill base develops late in first winter."
0,Roraiman Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmelastes saturatus,https://ebird.org/species/rorant2,"Dark bird of highland forest understory. Male is entirely dark gray except for bold white wing spots; female is brown above and rufous below with a gray face. Inhabits tall premontane forest, generally between 500–1800 m on tepui slopes, and is especially likely to be found in steep terrain and in areas with many large, mossy boulders. Usually found in pairs that forage for insects on or near the ground, probing into crevices and tossing aside leaves, much like others of genus; does not typically join mixed-species flocks. Song is a long series of sharp notes, swelling in volume and dropping in pitch at end. Very similar to Spot-winged Antbird of lowlands, which it replaces at higher elevations (no known overlap); best distinguished by voice and habitat."
0,Roraiman Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Herpsilochmus roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/rorant1,"A common but inconspicuous bird of tepui forest canopy. Usually seen from below; note long shape accentuated by heavy bill and long tail. Male is gray above and white below, with a black crown, bold white eyebrow, wing spotting, and extensively white undertail. Females are similar to males but have more brown tones in plumage. Forages sluggishly in canopy of tepui foothill forest, searching for insects along branches and in leaf clusters. More common at lower elevations than many other tepui endemics (sometimes below 500 m). Usually in pairs and best detected by voice; often follows mixed-species flocks but also found away from them. Contact call is a rubbery smacking, often doubled and repeated in long series by members of a pair. Song is a hoarse, emphatic series of laughing notes, decelerating and dropping slightly in pitch. Similar to Spot-tailed and Todd’s antwrens (and may overlap with latter at lower elevations) but substantially larger, with bolder markings and more white in tail; song is similar to that of Todd’s but longer and hoarser."
0,Roraiman Barbtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Roraimia adusta,https://ebird.org/species/rorbar1,"Small, boldly patterned bird of mossy tepui forests. Mostly rufous-brown on back and tail, with dark ear patch, bright white throat, and dark underparts streaked white. Found only in humid, mossy forest on tepui slopes, where it is often one of the more common understory birds provided moss growth is sufficient. Clambers over branches and climbs small tree trunks, gleaning insects from bark and probing into moss, usually in the understory but up into middle levels as well. Often follows mixed-species flocks. Contact call between members of a pair is an sharp squeak. Song is a series of 6–9 high-pitched, forceful notes, the first somewhat lower pitched. Unlikely to be mistaken for other species given bold plumage pattern and restricted range."
0,Roraiman Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiophobus roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/rorfly1,"Rare flycatcher with a scattered distribution in outlying ridges of the eastern Andes, the tepui region of northern South America, and several other remote mountain ranges. Inhabits cloud forest, often in areas with sandy soil. Combination of brown upperparts, rusty wingbars, and faintly streaked yellowish underparts separate it from other small flycatchers in range. Male has a reddish-orange crown patch that is almost always concealed. Gives a variety of calls including squeaks and rapid trills."
0,Roraiman Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Setopagis whitelyi,https://ebird.org/species/rornig1,"A medium-sized, dark nightjar of tepui highlands, difficult to identify by plumage alone. Cryptically patterned with dark brown and gray accented with buffy and whitish bars and spots. Male has a white band in the wing, which the female lacks.

Uniform sooty brown, lacking any strong plumage characteristics. Easily confused with Sick’s Swift, but is larger with longer wings, giving it a sleeker and more aerodynamic appearance; also lacks a pale throat, though this is often hard to see clearly. In central Bolivia it could be mistaken for Chestnut-collared Swift (some of which lack a chestnut collar), but wings are slightly narrower at the base. Usually seen in flocks of a few birds up to 20 or more that circle over humid forest."

Adult male is entirely dark blue and has a moderately long tail. Immature male has some green mixed into the blue plumage, and may have a buffy collar. Female is mostly green with a buffy or whitish collar, belly, and throat. Her tail is blue and shorter than male’s. This species is very localized, and prefers shorter forest and scrub near ridgelines."
0,Royal Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Thalasseus maximus,https://ebird.org/species/royter1,"Large tern, found strictly in coastal areas. Feeds in open ocean and saltwater bays, where it flies high above the water looking for small fish. Rests on beaches, often in groups with other species. Separated from many terns by large size; only slightly smaller than Caspian. Look for the thinner orange bill (usually not deep red) and shaggier crest compared with Caspian. Also, forehead whiter than Caspian Tern in the nonbreeding season; this can show as early as midsummer."
0,Ruaha Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myrmecocichla collaris,https://ebird.org/species/ruacha1,"Chunky, mostly black robin-like bird. The male has a white crown, while the female shows a white throat with some scaly dark markings. Both sexes have a large white panel in the wing. Found in woodland and scrub, often in rocky areas and near human habitation. The song is a variable, exuberant mix of whistling and rattling calls. Very similar to Arnot’s Chat, but usually separated by range, and also identified by the single large white patch on the wing, as opposed to one large patch and a smaller disconnected one."
0,Rubeho Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia aurantiithorax,https://ebird.org/species/rubaka1,"A rather small, demure understory denizen resembling a cross between a robin and a flycatcher. Mostly dull brown above, with an olive-brown crown and richer orange-brown underparts. Juvenile is more mottled. A highly local bird, found singly and in pairs in the understory of primary and secondary montane forest in a narrow range along the Rubeho and Ukaguru (and possibly Uluguru) mountains escarpment between 1800 and 2200 meters. Sits for long periods, sallying to catch insect prey, or forages on the ground, often in the company of ants and other ant-following birds. Sings a simple high-pitched “tsoot-tseeet-soo-seeet” and other similar songs. Calls include an invariable piping “wheet” uttered once a second. Alarm call is a grating, ticking “drrrzzt, drrrt, drrrt.” May be mistaken for a flycatcher, but its furtive nature and preference for thick understory are unique within its range."
0,Rudd's Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis ruddi,https://ebird.org/species/rudapa1,"A slender warbler that is gray and green above and pale below with a distinctive black throat band (narrower in the female), a short eyebrow, and a dark eye. Pairs are resident, occasionally joining flocks, in sand dune and riverine forest, thickets, and dense thorn scrub. The species is inconspicuous unless vocalizing: the male sings 5-15 rapid, repeated clucking “truk” notes that run together, and the female often joins in a duet with a more melodious trill. The similar Bar-throated Apalis differs from Rudd’s Apalis by having a pale eye and lacking an eyebrow."
0,Rudd's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Heteromirafra ruddi,https://ebird.org/species/rudlar1,"A small, stocky lark with an upright posture, a large head, and a short narrow tail. The back is spangled with tawny, black, and, white, and the head is boldly marked with a conspicuous eyebrow, an eye-ring, and a diagnostic pale central crown stripe. The throat and belly are plain, with the buff-washed breast diffusely streaked. Pairs are very local in heavily grazed short grassland between 1600-2000 meters of elevation. Males have a protracted aerial display, fluttering into the wind and dangling in the sky, in limbo, for up to 40 minutes. The easiest way to find Rudd’s Lark is when it is singing its distinctive song on the ground or in display, generally a short buzzy phrase of 3-5 (up to 8) notes, repeated several times a few seconds apart before the bird changes to a new variation, such as “Bee-dzip-pliieeep-DZREEE”, “Dr-rik-plip-SEEE” or “Krieek-kreee-OEEE.”"

Considerably smaller than other potoos, and distinguished from them by bright rufous plumage spotted with white. Inhabits middle and upper levels of tall forest, especially in regions with sandy soils, where it sallies from exposed perches for flying insects. Roosts during the day on thin branches and camouflages itself remarkably well by swaying with the breeze as if to mimic a suspended dead leaf. Voice, unlike that of other potoos, is a rapid, descending series of hoots with a bubbling quality, given infrequently and only for short periods. Unlikely to be confused with anything else; plumage recalls Oilbird, but potoo is much smaller and perches vertically."

0,Sakhalin Grasshopper Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Helopsaltes amnicola,https://ebird.org/species/sakwar1,"A nondescript songbird that skulks in taiga undergrowth, where very difficult to see well. Breeds on Hokkaido, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands. Very similar to Gray’s Grasshopper-Warbler, which breeds on mainland of far northeastern Asia and has a different song. Migrants very difficult to distinguish from Gray’s, but Sakhalin averages warmer-toned and browner, with perhaps a slightly paler throat. Sings from deep cover, day and night, a hurried, loud, choppy song."
0,Sakhalin Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus borealoides,https://ebird.org/species/salwar1,"Small songbird, virtually identical in plumage to Pale-legged Leaf Warbler, of which it was formerly considered a subspecies. Vertical tail pumping distinguishes this species from most others in its range except Pale-legged. Forages through the different layers of forest and like Pale-legged (and unlike most other leaf warblers) sometimes forages on the ground. Call note is a hard metallic “pit,” similar to Pale-legged, but marginally higher in frequency (visible on spectrogram); song a series of rhythmic whistles with clear distinctions between each note, very unlike the high, rapid trill of Pale-legged. Breeds in forest edges and clearings; can be found in a range of wooded habitats in migration and on wintering grounds."

0,Santa Marta Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Troglodytes monticola,https://ebird.org/species/samwre1,"Highly endangered wren restricted to grassy and scrubby areas above tree line high up in Colombia’s Santa Marta Mountains. Reaching its habitat involves a multi-day camping expedition, and it cannot be seen in the commonly birded areas lower down the mountains. Rich coloration and heavily barred underparts separate it from House Wren, the only other similar species that could possibly occur in its lofty domain. Song is a descending, tinkling series of notes."
0,Santarem Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Pyrrhura amazonum,https://ebird.org/species/sanpar2,"Long-tailed parakeet, mostly green with a scaled breast; has a narrow blue forehead and lacks a red patch on edge of shoulders. Feeds in small groups in the canopy of both humid non-flooded and seasonally flooded forests, as well as forest edges. Most often seen fleetingly, flying in noisy flocks through the sub-canopy. The similar Painted Parakeet has a larger blue patch on the forehead and red shoulder patch. The calls of Painted and Santarem parakeets are apparently indistinguishable."
0,Sapayoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sapayoidae,Sapayoa aenigma,https://ebird.org/species/sapayo1,"A strange greenish bird with a limited distribution from Panama to northwest Ecuador. Dull olive overall, slightly brighter yellow on the throat and upper breast. It also has a concealed yellow crown patch, but it is difficult to see. The bill is notably broad and subtly hooked at the tip. Somewhat large-headed and front-heavy. Despite its dull plumage, this species is relatively distinctive within its range. Compare with Green Manakin, which is more compact and slightly shorter-tailed than Sapayoa. Voice is also helpful: listen for Sapayoa’s “teew, teew” calls and its soft trilled chatter. Found in the understory of mature lowland forest, singly, in pairs, or in small groups, often following mixed-species flocks. Interestingly, this species has no close relatives in the Americas; it is most closely related to Asian broadbills."
0,Sapphire Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula sapphira,https://ebird.org/species/sapfly1,"Breeding adult male is royal blue with a white belly and orange throat and chest. Brown female is dull and potentially confusing, but note pale orange throat, rufous uppertail, and overall small stout appearance.

0,Sclater's Crowned-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Goura sclaterii,https://ebird.org/species/soucrp1,"An enormous pigeon of the southern lowland rainforests. Erect, mohicanlike crest is especially long at the back. Blue-gray body with maroon on shoulder and chest, up to the throat. Very large white patch can reach the edge of the wing. Has a deep-bellied appearance and twitches the tail nervously. Forages in small groups on the forest floor. Unmistakable and does not overlap with other crowned-pigeons. Call, loud 2-note booming, sounding like a beating heart."
0,Sclater's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Spizocorys sclateri,https://ebird.org/species/scllar1,"A medium-sized, compact lark with a bulbous head and a chunky pale bill that appears upturned. The plumage is buffy-brown, especially the underparts, and the eye is underlined with a dark stripe that has a diagnostic tear-drop mark. Pairs inhabit stark, stony plains with scattered small shrubs and occasional grass, where they flip stones and extract seeds from the bases of grass leaf-sheaths. The species is most often seen visiting waterholes in the heat of the day. Calls include a simple chirping “treeep” given repeatedly in flight and on the ground, often betraying its presence."
0,Sclater's Monal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophophorus sclateri,https://ebird.org/species/sclmon1,"Large terrestrial bird of foothill and montane pine forests with extensive rhododendron ground cover. Male brilliantly colored but oddly vulturine in appearance, with a small peaked head and blue skin around the eye. Appears dark from a distance, with bronzed neck and orange-tipped white tail; closer looks reveal greenish-blue gloss on the wings. Female streaky brown with dark blue eye patch and white-tipped tail. Gives loud, bisyllabic raptor-like screams and babbling shrieks in alarm."
0,Sclater's Myzomela,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Myzomela sclateri,https://ebird.org/species/scbmyz1,"A small honeyeater of forest on small islands off New Guinea and New Britain. Dark brown upperparts with pale yellow underparts, streaky chest and whitish underwings. Male has a black head and a bright red throat whereas the female only has a faint red chinspot. Male is unmistakable. Female similar to female Black or Olive-backed Sunbirds, but has a slightly streaky throat and chest. Also similar to female Red Myzomela, but female Sclater’s lacks the red tail and forehead. Call, a simple high-pitch “chip”."
0,Sclater's Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phyllomyias sclateri,https://ebird.org/species/scltyr1,"Small, long-tailed flycatcher of mid-elevation montane forest. Tends to perch fairly horizontally, foraging around the mid-story and canopy. Pale below, drab olive above, with yellow feather edges on the wing and tail and a gray head. Notice the white wingbars and eyebrow. Paler and drabber than other similar species like Buff-banded Tyrannulet; brighter white wingbars can also be a good distinguishing feature. Sclater’s song is a series of froggy churrs, interspersed with sharp “tlit” notes."
0,Sclater's Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala soror,https://ebird.org/species/sclwhi1,"A medium-sized bird of mid-montane forest. Yellow belly, olive back and white throat. Male has a black head and border to the throat. Female has a brown head and diffuse olive chest band. The male is similar to several other golden whistlers but lacks the yellow patch behind the head. Female is similar to Regent, Lorentz’s and Vogelkop Whistler’s but has white throat and brown head. Voice, a series of typical whistlerlike “chew!” or “whip!” notes that get louder and end with an explosive quality."
0,Scottish Crossbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxia scotica,https://ebird.org/species/scocro1,"Crossed bill tips give crossbills their name. Only found in pine forests of Scotland, where uncommon and local. As a rule, not safely identified in the field because it looks intermediate between smaller-billed Common (Red) Crossbill and bigger-billed Parrot Crossbill (both of which can occur in same areas). With experience (and computer analysis!), may be identified by voice. Like other crossbills, found in pairs or flocks feeding quietly on pine cones or calling excitedly before taking off in wide-ranging, bounding flight. Male plumage reddish overall; female grayish green overall, with brighter rump."
0,Scott's Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus parisorum,https://ebird.org/species/scoori,"This black-and-yellow oriole prefers dry habitats where yuccas are plentiful, often on steep hillsides. Males are particularly striking; look for the black back, head, and breast, bright white wingbar, and yellow shoulder. Females are duller grayish above, often retaining some black on the breast and throat. Young birds are quite dull; look for dull mottled streaking on the back. Listen for its whistled song, a rather fast series of clear notes. Feeds on insects, nectar, and fruit. Occurs from the southwestern U.S. to Oaxaca, where it can be found in mixed pine-oak woodland as well as dry desert hillsides."
0,Screaming Cowbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Molothrus rufoaxillaris,https://ebird.org/species/scrcow1,"Medium-sized cowbird found at woodland edges, savannas, and agricultural areas.

0,Screaming Piha,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Lipaugus vociferans,https://ebird.org/species/scrpih1,"One of the most characteristic sounds of Amazonian lowlands. This drab gray cotinga is commonly heard but infrequently seen throughout its range. Perches inconspicuously in the midstory but is betrayed by its song, a quiet introductory series of hoots followed by an ear splitting “SQUEE, SQUEE-AH.” Similar to Grayish Mourner, but is larger and lighter gray, with a larger, broader bill."
0,Scripps's Murrelet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Synthliboramphus scrippsi,https://ebird.org/species/xanmur2,"Small seabird, black above and white below. Breeds on rocky islands; otherwise found in warm offshore waters. Often seen in pairs on the water; frequently dives in search of fish. Short, thin bill. Very similar to Craveri's Murrelet; best separated by white, not gray, underwings. Once considered the same species as the similar Mexican cousin, the Guadalupe Murrelet, but now split into separate species. Guadalupe Murrelet has more white on the face, especially in front of the eye."
0,Scrub Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Dives warczewiczi,https://ebird.org/species/scrbla1,"A conspicuous blackbird of open country in western Ecuador, western Peru, and far southwestern Colombia.

Brown above, pale below, with gray face, olive wash on flanks, and small white wingbar. Narrow eyering imparts a spectacled appearance. Feeds much like a treecreeper, by hitching its way along tree trunks and branches. Compare Tasmanian Scrubwren, which is browner, larger, and has a strong supercilium. A Tasmanian endemic species."
0,Seaside Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Ammospiza maritima,https://ebird.org/species/seaspa,"The darkest sparrow found exclusively in wet saltmarshes with tall grass. Shares habitat with Saltmarsh and Nelson's Sparrows but Seaside is plainer and grayer overall. Plumage differs slightly among populations: Gulf Coast birds brighter, southern Florida birds show more distinct streaking below, Atlantic birds dullest. All populations have a contrasting white throat, yellow in front of eye, and a long bill. Perches conspicuously when singing, otherwise secretive, especially in winter. Rougher, buzzier song than Nelson's or Saltmarsh Sparrows: a few harsh introductory notes followed by a raspy sigh."
0,Secretarybird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Sagittariidae,Sagittarius serpentarius,https://ebird.org/species/secret2,"A distinctive, tall, long-legged, crane-like raptor with unique quill-like plumes on its head and bright-red facial skin. In flight, the dark edge to the hind wing, diamond-shaped tail, and long spatulate tail feathers make it unmistakable. It prefers open rangeland and savanna, where it strides about hunting for reptiles, small mammals, and insects, which it bludgeons with its powerful legs."
0,Sedge Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus schoenobaenus,https://ebird.org/species/sedwar1,"Fairly common to common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Favors marshy and scrubby habitats with reeds, brambles, and bushes, usually not in extensive pure reed beds. Often heard but can be hard to see: prolonged song much like a reed warbler but slightly faster-paced, jerkier, and overall rougher-toned. Most striking plumage feature is broad, pale buffy eyebrow; otherwise, upperparts rich dark brownish overall (with indistinct streaking), underparts buffy. Juvenile (in summer–autumn) has fine dusky streaks on breast."
0,Sedge Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cistothorus stellaris,https://ebird.org/species/sedwre1,"Tiny, bubbly, buffy-colored wren of damp grassy areas. Brighter cinnamon wash on flanks. Compared to similar Marsh Wren, note head pattern: Sedge has streaky crown and much less obvious pale eyebrow. Sedge also has barred wings and lacks plain dark brown shoulder patch. Also note habitat differences: prefers damp weedy fields and meadows, not cattail marshes. Generally secretive, but perches up when singing. Like most wrens, small size contrasts with large voice: one or two introductory notes followed by a loud, sharp, metallic trill of varying speed. Breeds mainly in the central U.S. and Canada; winters to northeast Mexico."
0,Selva Cacique,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Cacicus koepckeae,https://ebird.org/species/selcac1,"Rare cacique found very locally in lowland forest in southeastern Peru and extreme SW Brazil, especially near forest-fringed lakes and rivers. Note yellow rump and pale blue eye, which separate it from Solitary Black Cacique. Told from Yellow-rumped Cacique by the yellow being limited to the rump in Selva. No overlap with the closely related Ecuadorian Cacique. It has a varied vocal repertoire, with whistles, metallic squeaks, and various buzzing notes, among other calls."
0,Semicollared Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula semitorquata,https://ebird.org/species/semfly1,"Very similar to other black-and-white small flycatchers. Male differs from Collared and Pied Flycatchers in thinly connected black crown and mantle, and white median coverts. Female is identified by the double pale wingbars and less extensive white areas on the wing. Breeds in mountains and hills in mixed or deciduous forest. During migration found in tree groves in various habitats. Song is a high-pitched musical whistle interspersed with short scratches. Call is a short thin “seep” note and short metallic tacks."
0,Semicollared Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter collaris,https://ebird.org/species/semhaw2,"Tiny, rare hawk of mid-elevation cloud forest. Black upperparts and crown are separated by white band on back of neck, which can be indistinct and hard to see in the field. Underparts are white with broad, dark barring; also note dark comma-shaped blotch on side of neck. Immatures are tinged brown or rusty, with tan or buff neck band. Easily mistaken for Tiny Hawk, which occurs mainly at lower elevations; Semicollared has broader and more diffuse bars on underparts and more prominent neck markings. Typically stays inside forest, hunting small birds; occasionally soars."
0,Semicollared Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Malacoptila semicincta,https://ebird.org/species/sempuf1,"Chunky, large-headed bird of rainforest understory. Brown with extensive white streaking, and a band of reddish brown across the back of the neck. Usually sits motionless in the understory, sometimes moving with mixed species flocks with birds like ant-tanagers and antwrens, or at army ant swarms. Rarely gives its song, a high-pitched trill, but more frequently gives a weak whistled “weew” that sounds like a soft Tawny-crowned Greenlet and often is overlooked."
0,Semipalmated Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius semipalmatus,https://ebird.org/species/semplo,"Small, orange-legged plover with solid dark breast band. Medium-brown upperparts are the color of wet sand, noticeably darker than Piping or Snowy Plovers. Look for short, blunt bill with orange base (often indistinct on juveniles). Feeds on mudflats and beaches, often mixed with other shorebirds. Even when in a flock, individuals are typically spread out rather than remaining a tight unit. Breeds on the tundra or rocky beaches at northern latitudes; winters to southern South America. Migrants are common and widespread, inland and coastal. Listen for distinctive two parted “chu-weep!” calls, and assorted chortles and chuckles."
0,Semipalmated Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris pusilla,https://ebird.org/species/semsan,"Small, grayish-brown sandpiper. Typically shows relatively short, blunt-tipped bill, but this varies across the breeding range: western populations are shortest-billed, eastern populations are longest, and females have longer bills than males! Also note blackish legs, although they can appear dull gray or greenish. In breeding plumage, fairly pale grayish brown, sometimes with brighter rusty cap and cheek. Nonbreeding is plain gray above and white below. Juveniles have attractive scaly pattern on upperparts, and variable coloration: usually grayish with some buffy areas, occasionally brighter rufous.

It may now be extinct. While there have been a few reports in recent decades, the last substantiated sighting was in 1961. It is a dull, mostly gray bird with slightly paler underparts, brownish wings, yellow legs, and a hint of a pale eyebrow. Inhabits rainforest understory, and historical accounts suggest that it is quite shy and largely terrestrial. Its decline has been mainly attributed to introduced predators, though other factors may have been involved as well."
0,Senegal Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/senbat1,"Typical black, white, and dark-gray batis. Note the chest band, which is black in males and rufous in females. The cap is dark gray, and there is a long eyebrow that is white in males and buff in females. Found in all types of savanna, ranging from moist Guinea savanna to dry thorn savanna. Often in pairs. Male very similar to male Gray-headed and Western Black-headed Batises, but has a broader eyebrow stripe, and is usually associated with the distinctive female. The song is more variable, quieter, and less distinctive than that of most batises; usually includes a combination of buzzing notes and higher whistled “kreit” notes, and sometimes also wing and bill snaps."
0,Senegal Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/sencou1,"Small coucal with a black cap and buffy underparts.

In flight it has a distinctive white wedge on the back of the inner wing. Small groups scurry over open dry savanna and short-grass plains below 1600 m, looking for insects. It moves to areas experiencing bush fires as it prefers breeding in recently burned grasslands. It can be surprisingly unobtrusive, but the loud two-note “chi-whoo” call often gives it away. The similar Black-winged Lapwing differs by preferring high-altitude grassland and cultivation above 1300 m and in being larger, having reddish (not dark) legs, a larger, diffuse forehead patch, and a dark edge to the back of the inner wing."
0,Senegal Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Poicephalus senegalus,https://ebird.org/species/senpar,"Chunky mid-sized parrot with a green back and breast, a gray head, and a colorful belly that shows some geographical variation from yellow to reddish-orange.

Buff on the underparts and rufous-brown on the back. Found in remnant rainforest and secondary forest on the island of Mahe, in the Seychelles. The odd vocalization is a low, raspy “grrrrr” that is given at a rate of about one note every two seconds, sometimes for several minutes at a stretch. The sound could easily be dismissed as a frog. Visually the species is easily identified, as the only other owl on Mahe is the much larger Barn Owl."
0,Seychelles Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris dussumieri,https://ebird.org/species/seysun2,"A drab brown sunbird with a long downcurved bill.

The rufous rump is conspicuous in flight. The sexes are similar, though males are brighter overall and have more rufous on the face. Found locally in dry thorn savanna and cultivated areas, sometimes around human habitation. Similar to Somali Sparrow, but the male is separated by his gray crown and the female by her much more colorful overall plumage. Very similar to Kenya Rufous Sparrow, but not known to overlap in range, and Shelley’s is separated by its dark eye. The call is a cheerful “chirp” like that of other sparrows."
0,Shelley's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/shesta1,"A small dark starling of dry country. The upperparts are iridescent, with a blue sheen on the head and green on most of the wing. Also note the chestnut underparts and the yellow-orange eye. Found in dry thorn savanna and thorn scrub, usually in small wandering flocks, often with other species of starlings. Similar to Hildebrandt’s Starling, but slightly smaller and darker overall, with a deeper rufous belly and a less contrasting green wing.

Cryptically patterned with ear tufts and yellow eyes. Currently only known from a 19th-century specimen, it has not been seen in the wild in modern times, and there are no confirmed field photographs or sound recordings. Presumably a very low-density forest owl, as very little habitat remains on Siau. Should be unmistakable, as it is the only owl on the island. Call currently unconfirmed, although recently a rolling ""ook-grrrrah” has been reported."

Breeding male has a black head, broad white half-collar, and rusty-red chest. Non-breeding male is patchier, with a paler head and chest. Female is predominantly streaky brown above, with a weaker, less contrasting face and chest pattern. European Stonechat is very similar, and can pose identification problems where the species overlap; look for Siberian’s larger white wing patch, duller orange on the chest, and whiter rump. Amur Stonechat is extremely similar, and in areas of overlap, or in cases of vagrancy, most individuals are inseparable based on current knowledge."

Very similar in appearance to other “Pallas’s-type” leaf warblers in its range. Bleached-white crown stripe and predominantly white brow stripes distinguish this species from the much yellower Pallas’s Leaf Warbler. Sichuan lacks the white tail edges (visible in flight) of Buff-barred and Ashy-throated warblers. Appears nearly identical to Lemon-rumped Warbler but has a brighter yellow rump and averages darker olive-green above. Breeds in mid- to high-elevation coniferous and mixed forests, but descends into foothills in the winter. Song has two types, both of which are difficult to distinguish from those of Lemon-rumped Warbler, but they tend to be slower in their delivery. Calls are crisp notes, slower-sounding and longer than those of Lemon-rumped Warbler."
0,Sichuan Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila rufipectus,https://ebird.org/species/sicpar1,"A rare and retiring partridge of mixed forest, found only in the south-central portion of China’s Sichuan province. If seen well, combination of orange cheek patch, striped white throat, and broad maroon chest band is diagnostic. Forms small flocks during the nonbreeding season, like many other related species. Duets loudly at dawn and dusk."
0,Sichuan Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera griseiceps,https://ebird.org/species/sicthr1,"Little-known thrush which breeds in the dense hilly and montane forests of China’s northern and central Sichuan province; favors dense understory and coniferous stands. Brown above with scaled white underparts. Grayish crown and heavier bill distinguish this species from similar Alpine Thrush, while short tail and lack of prominent “earmuffs” separate it from Long-tailed Thrush. Beautiful melodic song is rich and smooth, without many harsh notes."
0,Sichuan Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile weigoldicus,https://ebird.org/species/sictit1,"Small drab tit with the typical black-head-white-cheek pattern of most tits. Darker-flanked and with a patchier ""bib"" than similar Black-bibbed Tit. Found in mid- to high-elevational hill and montane forests, often in areas with pines. Like many other small tits, an active forager, hovering and clambering about on thin branches, sometimes in mixed flocks. Gives a wide range of different vocalizations, including nasal and chipping call notes. Song includes nasal notes and a repeated high “tseep”."
0,Sichuan Treecreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Certhiidae,Certhia tianquanensis,https://ebird.org/species/sictre1,"Dull, short-billed treecreeper with a white throat, brown upperparts, and brown-suffused pale underparts. Restricted to mature montane coniferous stands, especially fir. Like other treecreepers, scrambles quickly up trunks and along branches with its tail held flat against the bark. Very similar to Hodgson’s Treecreeper, but Sichuan averages darker on the face and belly, with a different song: a long tinkling series of descending high notes. Call is high-pitched and sputtery, like a sped-up version of the song."
0,Sick's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Chaetura meridionalis,https://ebird.org/species/sicswi1,Small swift with a uniform brown body contrasting with a pale-ochre rump and slightly paler throat.

0,Sierra Leone Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Schistolais leontica,https://ebird.org/species/silpri2,"A mostly dark gray long-tailed warbler with a striking whitish eye, buff flanks, and pinkish legs. Local and scarce in a handful of hills and mountains in Upper Guinea, where pairs and small groups skulk low down in very wet forest edge, riverine scrub, and thickets in gullies between 600 and 1600 meters of elevation. Calls include a high-pitched “sit-sit-sit.” and a more nasal “bur-bur-bur.” Other warblers lack the pale eye."
0,Sierra Madre Ground-Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Robsonius thompsoni,https://ebird.org/species/simgrw1,"A medium-sized bird of the forest floor from the lowlands to low elevations in the mountains in northeastern Luzon. Fairly stout, with a pale lower bill, long legs, and large feet. Pale below, with a grayish, faintly scaled chest and brown under the base of the tail. Note rufous face and forehead with pale bare skin in front of the eye, brown upperparts with two dotted white wingbars, and chestnut flight feathers. Note the white throat with black speckling below and a thin black moustache stripe. Unmistakable. Song consists of a very high-pitched “tseeee-sip tsee-wee!”"
0,Sierra Madre Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Xenospiza baileyi,https://ebird.org/species/simspa1,"Very local and endangered small sparrow of highlands in central Mexico; endemic. Occurs in bunchgrass within areas of open pine woods; often rather elusive. Feeds on the ground in grassy areas and adjacent plowed fields, but sings from prominent grass stalks. Plumage looks much like Song Sparrow, with gray face, black-streaked breast and flanks, and rusty wings. Song Sparrow is larger and bulkier, with less extensive rusty in wings, and almost always lives in wetter habitats."
0,Sierra Nevada Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Arremon basilicus,https://ebird.org/species/sthbrf4,"Shy and skulking brushfinch restricted to cloud forest in Colombia’s Santa Marta Mountains. Quite distinctive in its limited range, with a black face and breast spot, white throat, and striped head. It stays low in the understory and is often hard to see, but sometimes visits feeders within El Dorado Nature Reserve, where it can be easier to find. Song is a long series of high-pitched squeaks and trills."
0,Sierra de Lema Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Mionectes roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/mccfly3,"Small flycatcher restricted to mountains in southeastern Venezuela and adjacent parts of Brazil and Guyana. Plumage is olive with tawny on the breast and lower underparts. Formerly considered a subspecies of the very similar McConnell's Flycatcher, but it sounds different and is found at higher elevations. Separated from Ochre-bellied Flycatcher by lack of wingbars and different voice. Stays fairly low in humid forest, and sometimes joins mixed species flocks. Males loosely congregate in display areas where they sing a short, falling then rising metallic trill. Also gives chaotic bursts of modulated notes as well as sharp chips."
0,Sierran Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia pallatangae,https://ebird.org/species/sieela3,"Confusing flycatcher of montane forest. It has olive-gray upperparts, pale yellow underparts, white wingbars, and a small crest that is usually held flat. When crest is raised, it may show some white. Very similar to White-crested Elaenia, but usually brighter yellow on the belly and may show a more conspicuous eyering. Birds in worn plumage may not be identifiable with certainty. Its most common vocalizations, which include clear whistles and burry calls, are similar to those of other elaenias."

Warm tones on the tail contrast sharply with the cooler brown on the back and wings. Inhabits broadleaf and mixed forests, where it usually forages at the middle and upper levels. Unlike other treecreepers in the region, gives a long rapid-fire rattling trill instead of a series of high whistles and twitters."
0,Silver Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae,https://ebird.org/species/silgul2,"Small gray gull with red legs. Adult has red bill (younger birds have a darker bill), white head and body, pale gray ""silver"" wings, which have prominent black and white tips. Abundant across much of New Zealand and coastal Australia, including inland areas around waterways and rivers."
0,Silver Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus mellianus,https://ebird.org/species/silori1,"Male’s bone-white back and belly are unlike that of any other oriole. Female has the same black head and wings but has a gray-brown back and a densely streaked belly. Both sexes have reddish tails. Shape and color scheme are similar to Maroon Oriole (minimal range overlap), which is much darker and browner overall. Forages in the canopy and sometimes perches out on exposed snags and treetops. Uncommon and localized in lowland and foothill moist forests. Song is a musical, flute-like series of whistles. Gives cat-like mewing calls."
0,Silver Pheasant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophura nycthemera,https://ebird.org/species/silphe,"Large and spectacular pheasant found in forested areas. Variable across its large range, but the long-tailed male has either white or silvery-gray upperparts with a black crest, breast, and belly. Northern males are whiter above than their southern counterparts, though they still have some light black markings on the wings and back. Females are brownish overall with a much shorter tail. Both sexes have bright red face and legs. Hybridizes extensively with Kalij Pheasant where ranges overlap, producing variable intermediate hybrids."
0,Silver Teal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/siltea1,"Distinctive, but rather local and uncommon in Chile (more common in Argentina and elsewhere) in grassy wetlands, reedy marshes, and on lakes. Associates with other waterfowl, but usually is not out on open water and is easily overlooked. Readily identified by small size, dark cap, pale cheeks, and blue bill with yellow patch at base. Range does not overlap with the larger and more boldly patterned Puna Teal."
0,Silverbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis semipartitus,https://ebird.org/species/silver1,"A beautiful, distinctive, and simply marked flycatcher with silvery gray upperparts and orange underparts. Juveniles are buff-and-gray, lacking orange, and are covered in complex scalloped markings. Found in fairly moist thorn savanna, woodland, and cultivated areas. Perches conspicuously on open branches and other exposed perches. The song is a chatty mix of high-pitched squeaks and whistles, reminiscent of the song of a magpie-robin."
0,Silvered Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Sclateria naevia,https://ebird.org/species/silant1,"Unique-looking antbird with a strong affinity for water. Medium-sized and chunky with a rather long bill. Male is medium-gray with a white throat and white spotting on the wings. Note the messy scaly appearance on the breast. Female is similar in pattern but is brownish overall, not gray. Note pale pink legs on both sexes. Widespread and reasonably common throughout much of lowland northern South America, east of the Andes. Almost always found in pairs near the edge of rivers or lakes in lowland forest."
0,Silvereye,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Zosterops lateralis,https://ebird.org/species/silver3,"Tiny bird with an obvious pale eyering. Subspecies vary in plumage; most have a green head, green lores (area between bill and eye), yellowish throat, gray (or green) back, pale gray underparts, and green wings and tail. The migratory Tasmanian subspecies has brownish flanks. Rather common, seen in small flocks that feed in bushes and shrubs in the mid-story. The only species of white-eye over much of its range."
0,Silvery Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps occipitalis,https://ebird.org/species/silgre1,"Widespread, small pale grebe of lakes and reservoirs, often with no surrounding vegetation; nests mainly in colonies, locally by the hundreds. The southern population also occurs in coastal waters in winter. Often looks mostly white at a distance, unlike the darker White-tufted Grebe. The southern population has a silvery-blond hood (reduced in young and nonbreeding birds) and a grayish throat while the northern Andean population has a blond-streaked cap, a white throat, and looks the same year-round. Also note vocal differences between southern and northern populations."
0,Silvery Wood-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba argentina,https://ebird.org/species/siwpig1,"Beautiful grayish-white pigeon with black wing- and tail-tips. Rare, little-known, and extremely localized; now found only on islands off western Sumatra (though may occasionally wander onto the main island), where it forages in lowland and hill forest.

Almost uniformly rufous-brown, with very inconspicuous (often flattened) ear tufts. The only resident scops-owl on Simeulue; migrant Oriental Scops-Owls could also occur on the island, but average larger, and have a more well-defined facial disc. Utilizes a variety of wooded habitats, from pristine forests to plantations. Listen for its song, a series of hiccupy piping notes, somewhat reminiscent of a barbet. Also gives a series of short squeals, which are sometimes mixed in with the song."
0,Simple Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Chlorocichla simplex,https://ebird.org/species/simgre1,"As befits the name, this large, classically patterned greenbul is one of the easiest to identify visually in the field. A brown greenbul of thick bushes and forest edge, it has a bright white throat, a white belly, and white eye-arcs around its dark reddish eyes. Can be confused with Central African populations of Yellow-throated Greenbul that have white throats, but Simple Greenbul’s white eye-arcs and pale belly are distinctive. Song is a cawing, robust, variable chatter: “rar-ra-ra-kora-rawr.”"
0,Sinai Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus synoicus,https://ebird.org/species/sinros1,"A small and long-tailed, small-billed finch. Virtually unstreaked. Male has a pink face and breast with a whitish forehead and crown. Female is pale gray-brown overall with a whitish belly. Lives in deep desert canyons. Resident or locally nomadic.

Calls are high, nasal caws."
0,Sinaloa Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne sinaloae,https://ebird.org/species/sinmar1,"Large swallow; very local summer resident in mountains of northwest Mexico. Favors open pine-oak forest, usually with big dead pine snags and cliffs, where nests in cavities. Ranges widely in highlands and foothills, coming to drink at ponds and lakes. Usually seen as singles or small groups, which may associate with other swallows. Male blue-black overall with contrasting white belly. Female similar to several other martins, but clean white belly contrasts more strongly with dark breast."
0,Sinaloa Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Thryophilus sinaloa,https://ebird.org/species/sinwre1,"Small skulking wren of lowlands and foothills in west Mexico. Favors thorn forests, plantations, and thickets, often in slightly more open situations than Happy Wren. Heard more often than seen. Song a powerful series of rich whistles, quite different from Happy Wren song. Scolding calls vary, but does not make ""comb trill"" of Happy. Plumage rather plain, with bold white eyebrow and indistinct stripes on sides of neck; no similar-looking species in its range."
0,Sind Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer pyrrhonotus,https://ebird.org/species/sinspa1,"A small, strikingly patterned sparrow which is extremely similar to the House Sparrow. The male has a bright chestnut eye-stripe, a gray crown and hindneck, a black patch restricted to the chin, a large white shoulder patch, and a black bill. The female is like the female House Sparrow, but note the less contrasting face with grayer head and cheeks. Found in scrub and reedy habitat along rivers, canals, and other wetlands. Colonial, and also mixes with other sparrows and finches."
0,Sind Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos assimilis,https://ebird.org/species/sinwoo1,"Only black-and-white woodpecker in most of its range. Note the big white shoulder patches and white bars on the black back. Very similar to Syrian Woodpecker, but the Sind Woodpecker is smaller, with a thinner moustache, more white on the back, and a slightly smaller bill. Inhabits dry, open scrub and woodlands. Calls include a squeaky trill and a single-noted “kwik.”"
0,Singing Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola cantans,https://ebird.org/species/sincis1,"Relatively large and colorful cisticola. Has a rufous panel in the wing, a rufous cap, and a dark band near the tip of the tail. Found in a variety of lush, open habitats, including scrub, overgrown cultivation, and moist savannah. Usually in pairs, and sometimes in small groups. The distinctive vocalizations are a musical “tu-lip” from the male, often accompanied by rasping calls from the female. Similar to Red-faced Cisticola, but separated by the rufous wing panel. Also similar to plain-backed subspecies of Rattling Cisticola, but separated by very different voice."

0,Singing Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Dactylortyx thoracicus,https://ebird.org/species/sinqua1,"Small, retiring quail of forest understory. Rarely seen, but can be located by listening for noisy rustling in the leaf litter as birds scratch like chickens. Prefers to run away rather than flush. Loud song often reveals its presence, given mainly early and late in the day: first few notes similar to Little Tinamou song, but then breaks into rollicking choruses that can be almost deafening if close by. Male has rusty face and gray body, female colors reversed, with gray face and rusty body."
0,Singing Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Aplonis cantoroides,https://ebird.org/species/sinsta1,"Large songbird of New Guinea and Solomon Islands, also on Boigu Island in the northern Torres Strait.

Teardrop-shaped dark patch around each eye gives it a distinctly fashionable, elegant appearance. Forages on or close to the ground in the dense undergrowth of dry forests and scrubby areas. Scurries or flaps laboriously away when disturbed."
0,Sjöstedt's Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Baeopogon clamans,https://ebird.org/species/sjogre1,"A unusual dark greenbul often found near water in the forest interior. Decorated in various shades of dark and olive green, with a gray throat that contrasts with the breast, a buffy belly, and bright white sides of the tail. Can be confused with both Honeyguide Greenbul and actual honeyguides, but the flight is direct rather than undulating, the throat contrasts with the breast, the eyes are always dark, and the vocalizations are distinctive. Can be located by its “REHR!” calls, often followed by a series of fast, scratchy notes and sometimes repeated for minutes on end."
0,Sladen's Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Lybiidae,Gymnobucco sladeni,https://ebird.org/species/slabar1,"Dark, chunky barbet with an odd tuft of buff feathers on its forehead. Usually found in small groups on and around dead trees in lowland rainforest, gallery forest, and secondary growth. Sometimes occurs alongside Gray-throated Barbet.

Male gray overall with blackish throat and breast patch and white wingbars. Female notably drab brownish overall, with paler throat and eyering; best identified by nearby presence of male."
0,Slaty Becard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Pachyramphus spodiurus,https://ebird.org/species/slabec1,"This flycatcher-like bird of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru can be tough to identify with certainty due to its similarity with the slightly larger One-colored Becard. On male, look for white fringes to some of the wing feathers and a faint, pale spot between the eye and bill. On female, this pale spot is harder to see, but she tends to have a warmer, more tawny-colored breast. Voice is also a good clue: Slaty Becard often gives a ringing, raspy trill. Most common in dry and semi-humid forest but also locally found in humid forest."
0,Slaty Bristlefront,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Merulaxis ater,https://ebird.org/species/slabri1,"Odd-looking terrestrial species with a long tail and a small tufty crest. Found in the understory of humid and montane forests and is rarely easy to see. Males have a dusky gray upper-body and a dark-brown lower-body, while females are all dark brown above and cinnamon below.

It occurs solitarily or in small groups, preferring marshes and floodplains; it avoids open areas, seeking cover in small channels or near long grass. Slaty Egrets walk slowly, shuffling their feet to surprise fish and frogs. Although it is mostly resident, it can disperse widely outside of its core range. The similar Black Egret differs by having a dark throat, dark legs with yellow feet, and occasionally foraging in a distinctive “umbrella” position, whereby it covers its head with its wings."
0,Slaty Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia strepera,https://ebird.org/species/slaela1,"Highly migratory flycatcher; it nests from about September through March along the east slope of the Andes in Bolivia and northwestern Argentina, then disperses as far as northern South America. It is mostly gray, with a pale belly, faint wingbars, and a broken eyering. Bill is stubby and yellow at the base. Male has a white crown patch that is usually hidden; females and immatures are tinged olive. Inhabits humid forest, and very inconspicuous when not singing.

0,Slaty Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Spodiornis rusticus,https://ebird.org/species/slafin1,"Small finchlike bird, actually more closely related to tanagers. Male is uniform slaty gray overall with no contrasting plumage features. Female is paler grayish with some buffy tones on face and blurry streaking on breast. Best feature on both sexes is bill: fairly long and very pointy. A nomadic bamboo specialist, difficult to reliably locate because populations move around to follow seeding Chusquea bamboo. Usually seen singly or in pairs; typically stays on or near the ground. Listen for stuttering high-pitched song."
0,Slaty Flowerpiercer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa plumbea,https://ebird.org/species/slaflo1,"Flowerpiercers have a unique upturned bill with a sharp hook at the tip; they use it to pierce the bases of flowers to extract nectar. The bill shape alone is enough to identify Slaty Flowerpiercer in its range; also note male’s uniform blue-gray plumage. Female is dull brown. Found in mountains above 1300m, usually in pairs foraging in bushes at the forest edge, shrubby second growth, and gardens."

Common call is a descending high-pitched whinny; also gives a whistled ""per-WEE"" call somewhat like spring peeper but clearer and consistently two parted."
0,Souimanga Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris sovimanga,https://ebird.org/species/sousun2,"Small, hyperactive bird with a curved bill. Breeding males are colorful, with iridescent upperparts, and a yellow belly in most of the range, and a white belly in southwest Madagascar. Females are much duller, but can be told from female Madagascar Sunbird by their smaller size, smaller bill, and less distinct streaks below. Common in any habitat with woody vegetation. Feeds mainly on nectar, and flits around constantly. The song is a cheerful and explosive jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,South African Shelduck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Tadorna cana,https://ebird.org/species/soashe1,"A mostly rusty-colored waterfowl. Male has a gray neck and head; female similar with a whitish face. Resident and nomadic throughout its range, preferring estuaries, rivers, and impoundments within arid zones. Gives a honk call. Egyptian Goose is similar, but larger, with a brown blotch in the middle of the chest and a different head pattern that includes a tawny eye surrounded by an expanded rusty eye-ring. Egyptian Goose honk is higher and harsher than this species."
0,South American Painted-Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Rostratulidae,Nycticryphes semicollaris,https://ebird.org/species/soapas1,"Distinctive and attractive, but a rarely seen denizen of fresh and brackish wetlands, especially with shallow water and low to knee-high grasses; also found on lakeshores with taller reeds and rushes. Occasionally seen feeding quietly at edge of vegetation, but mostly seen when flushed from close range. Flies up silently with stiff flicking wingbeats and brief glides, long legs trailing, and drops back to cover usually not far away. Note bold white spots on wings and droop-tipped bill. Related to jacanas, not closely related to the typical snipe."
0,South American Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna hirundinacea,https://ebird.org/species/soater1,"Medium-sized tern, mostly restricted to coastal areas. In breeding plumage, strikingly pale gray above and below with an extensive black cap, and an unmarked red bill and legs. The tail reaches beyond the wing tips when at rest. Wings are uniformly pale gray with no black. Nonbreeding birds have a half hood. Juveniles are mottled brown on the back."
0,South Georgia Diving-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pelecanoides georgicus,https://ebird.org/species/sgdpet1,"A very small, chunky petrel. Note the short broad wings and the pale white throat and underside. Look for whitish rump patches and gray feathering behind the eyes. Breeds on islands in the circumpolar subantarctic zone. Most populations nest on rocky slopes or flat land, but the population on Codfish Island, New Zealand, nests in burrows within unstable sand dunes no more than 100 meters from the sea; this population is sometimes split as a different species. Difficult to distinguish from Common Diving-Petrel at sea due to subtlety of plumage differences."
0,South Georgia Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus antarcticus,https://ebird.org/species/sogpip1,"This small streaky buff-brown ground-dweller is the only resident songbird on South Georgia Island, where it inhabits rocky shorelines, offshore islets, inland pools, and stands of tussac grass. Forages actively for invertebrates, running about and flicking its tail. Like many other Antarctic and subantarctic species, can be quite confiding, often allowing for close approach. Gives husky metallic “wick” and “tsik” notes, the latter typically given when in flight. Males perform a songflight display, giving jangling metallic phrases at well-spaced intervals."
0,South Georgia Shag,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Leucocarbo georgianus,https://ebird.org/species/sogsha1,"Typical “blue-eyed shag”, endemic to the South Georgia, South Orkney, and South Sandwich Islands, as well as Shag Rocks. Striking adult has the bicolored coloration, yellow caruncles, and white shoulder bar typical of that group; also a small stiff crest during the early breeding season. Juvenile is much drabber, being simply dark above and white below. Almost identical to Antarctic Shag, but ranges do not overlap. Breeds on rocky cliffs and ledges, as well as tussock-covered slopes. Tends to forage close to the islands, but may disperse to find open water in winter months."
0,South Island Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus finschi,https://ebird.org/species/soioys1,"Heavy-set black-and-white shorebird, affectionately known by New Zealand birders as “SIPO” (rhymes with “typo”). Shows a distinctive red eye, long thick reddish bill, and thick pale-pink feet and legs. Found breeding along braided riverbeds, pastures, and lakes in the South Island of New Zealand, with a few breeding records on the North Island. Most of the population migrates north to estuaries, harbors, and sandy beaches in the North Island and northern South Island. Regular vagrant to Australia during the winter. Often heard giving distinct “kleep” call. Similar to pied-morph Variable Oystercatcher in New Zealand; look for SIPO’s smaller size, sharp border between black and white on lower chest, and extensive white on rump and back. Distinguished from Pied Oystercatcher in Australia by smaller size, longer and thinner bill, shorter legs, and more extensive white up the back and on the wings."
0,South Island Piopio,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Turnagra capensis,https://ebird.org/species/soipio1,"Extinct, last reported in 1897."
0,South Island Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Petroica australis,https://ebird.org/species/nezrob3,A small charcoal-colored songbird endemic to New Zealand. Confined to the South and Stewart Islands. Favors native and exotic forest stands. Males have a more distinct separation between dark gray and cream on their chest than females. Juveniles mirror the look of a female but with less to no cream underneath. Can be incredibly confiding and curious about humans. It is possible to bring individuals out into the open by disturbing leaf litter and then sitting quietly. Actively flushes out prey with foot trembling and by flicking its wings and tail. Male song is a loud and simple phrase of notes including “pwee-pwee-pwee.”
0,South Island Saddleback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Callaeidae,Philesturnus carunculatus,https://ebird.org/species/saddle3,"A medium-sized songbird endemic to New Zealand, confined to predator-free offshore islands and South Island mainland sanctuaries. Glossy black plumage with distinct chestnut saddle across the back, which gives the bird its name. Note the bright reddish-orange wattles on either side of the bill. Juveniles have smaller wattles and are chocolate brown for their first year. Listen for distinct calls resembling a blaring “cheeet ta-chet ta-chet ta-chet” sound. Constantly moves noisily as it restlessly forages on the floor and through the canopy. Flicks over leaves and digs into rotting logs with its strong bill in search of invertebrates. Distinguished from Eurasian Blackbird by chestnut saddle and wattles."
0,South Island Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Coenocorypha iredalei,https://ebird.org/species/soisni1,"Extinct, last reported in 1964."
0,South Melanesian Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina caledonica,https://ebird.org/species/melcus1,"A large cuckooshrike with uniformly matte slaty-black plumage and a very striking pale eye. Long-tailed, with a relatively stubby bill. Resident in forests, usually in foothills and lowlands, especially coastal forest. Unlikely to be confused. Most common call is an ascending whistle, often followed by a shrill “kwa-kwawa-kwawa.”"
0,South Moluccan Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Erythropitta rubrinucha,https://ebird.org/species/sompit1,"An unmistakable plump, short-tailed, long-legged forest bird with a red belly. A spectacular species displaying a broad iridescent blue chest band, a dark purplish-glossed head with blue cheek markings, a reddish nape, and moss-green upperparts. Found in forested lowlands and foothills and within bamboo thickets. Usually seen singly, most often either foraging on the forest floor or calling from low understory branches. Confined to the islands of Buru and Seram. Gives a distinctive soft, quivering two-part whistle: “waaaaaaaoop-aaaaaaww.” First part ascends, and the second is a mournful, descending whistle."
0,South Polar Skua,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius maccormicki,https://ebird.org/species/sopsku1,"Bulky cold-brown seabird with white wing flashes. Usually seen singly in strong and direct flight, sometimes resting on the ocean with rafts of shearwaters. Chases gulls, large shearwaters, and even boobies, forcing them to regurgitate their food. Plumage overall rather plain, dark gray-brown, suggesting a muscular immature gull but with big white wing flashes, like the smaller, more lightly built jaegers. Often shows a pale blaze across the nape. Some birds have very pale blonde head and body. Breeds in Antarctica, further south than almost any other species of bird. Ranges across all oceans, mainly from March to October, typically staying offshore and very rarely seen from land. Compare with other skua species. In North Atlantic, Great Skua is warmer-toned, has a more capped or hooded appearance, and adults have golden spangles on upperparts. Separation from Brown Skua in Southern Hemisphere is more problematic; there are multiple populations of Brown Skuas and hybrids with South Polar are quite frequent! South Polar averages smaller-billed and slightly less bulky than Brown, and never has bold streaks or spangles on upperparts, but many birds are best left unidentified."
0,Southern Marquesan Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus mendanae,https://ebird.org/species/marwar2,"A medium-sized reed warbler, bright yellow below and tawny above, with pale-edged black wing feathers. Bill long and slightly downcurved, giving the bird a very “long-headed” appearance. Found in scrubby areas and plantations, avoiding deep primary forest. Call is a harsh “tchak.” Song is a mix of whistles, churring, warbling, and rasping scold notes."
0,Southern Antpipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Corythopis delalandi,https://ebird.org/species/souant1,"Medium-sized odd-looking, ground-walking flycatcher of humid forests and second growth. Unmistakable in most of its range with its olive-brown back, yellow bill, white face and belly, and black breast. Told from Ringed Antpipit, for which there is barely any distributional overlap, by being paler and less olive above with a creamier chin and throat. Generally shy but its song is very distinct: a melodic series of explosive “preeeh-prrrwee-prurr-prii” notes. Also makes loud bill-snapping noises."
0,Southern Bald Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Geronticus calvus,https://ebird.org/species/balibi1,"A large, striking, dark ibis with a past- pale face and red legs, crown, and bill. The immature is duller, lacking red coloration. Small-to-medium-sized flocks forage for large insects and small animals in high-altitude grassland between 1200 and 1800 m, preferring short grass and recently burnt areas. It breeds in nearby rocky gorges and cliffs. Hadada Ibis is dark, and it may be confused for Southern Bald Ibis in flight, but Hadada Ibis has a thicker neck and less streamlined head."
0,Southern Beardless-Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Camptostoma obsoletum,https://ebird.org/species/sobtyr1,"Small flycatcher, common and widespread from Costa Rica to Argentina. Plumage is nondescript (and quite variable across range), but note bushy crest, active behavior, short bill, and plain face. Singles, pairs, or small groups can be found in a variety of wooded habitats, from dry scrub to the edge of mature rainforest, but often prefers second growth. Voice varies across range, with different populations probably representing separate species. Northern birds give plaintive whistled “teew, teew, teew” notes. Southern birds can give much different descending sputtering trill in addition to plaintive whistles."
0,Southern Bentbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Oncostoma olivaceum,https://ebird.org/species/souben1,"A tiny well-named flycatcher with a distinctive bent bill like a broken nose. It is olive-green above with paler yellowish underparts. Note the pale gray eyes. Inconspicuous; typically seen singly in the understory of lowland forest, edge, and second-growth. Best detected by trilling calls. Occurs from Panama to Colombia; no range overlap with similar Northern Bentbill."
0,Southern Black-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis pammelaina,https://ebird.org/species/sobfly1,"A slim and lustrous glossy-black flycatcher with upright posture, dark brown eyes, and a straight-edged square tail. Females are less glossy, and juveniles are spotted brown. Singles, pairs, or small groups frequent woodland, savanna, forest edge, and parkland, where they join mixed-species flocks. This species perches on branches and either pounces to the ground to hunt prey or pursues passing insects; it often associates with Fork-tailed Drongo, which it may imitate. The call is a three-note “tseeep-tsoo-tsoo.” The similar Fork-tailed Drongo differs by having red eyes and a forked tail, and Northern Black-Flycatcher differs by having dull matte black rather than glossy plumage."
0,Southern Black-Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Melaniparus niger,https://ebird.org/species/soublt1,"A large, active, noisy black tit with white shoulders, white edgings to the wing feathers, and a barred gray-and-white undertail. Pairs and small groups form the core of mixed-species feeding flocks in broadleaf woodland and thorn scrub. The species is often detected by its noisy buzzing and chirping vocalizations, including a sweet-and-scratchy “diddy-dzee-dzee-dzee-dzee-dzee.” The very similar Carp’s Tit is black under the tail; ranges only narrowly overlap."
0,Southern Boubou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius ferrugineus,https://ebird.org/species/soubou1,"A plump, dark-backed bushshrike with a creamy throat; buff-rufous flanks, thighs and belly; and a striking white stripe on the dark wing. The female is duller and less glossy than the male. Pairs are shy and skulking residents of thickets and tangles in fynbos, forest, and woodland. The species forages furtively by creeping stealthily and hopping slowly, close to the ground. Normally boubous are first detected by their loud distinctive ringing duets: “wheeet-whee-do-do-do”; their single loud “wheee” notes; and a rattling scold like the vibrating of a seed-pod shaker. The similar Tropical Boubou has paler underparts than the Southern Boubou."
0,Southern Bristle-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phylloscartes eximius,https://ebird.org/species/sobtyr2,"Tiny and strikingly-plumaged flycatcher with a long tail and distinct face pattern. Has a gray crown, a broad white eyebrow with a vertical black crescent running behind the eyes. The body is olive-yellow above and bright yellow below. An uncommon and threatened inhabitant of the middle levels of montane forests and forest edges including Araucaria forests. The song is a high-pitched trill."
0,Southern Brown Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx australis,https://ebird.org/species/sobkiw1,"The largest of New Zealand’s kiwis. A reddish to dark brown kiwi with brown to black streaking. Inhabits native forest, tussock grassland, and neighboring farmland. Mostly nocturnal, with some day foraging observed on Stewart Island and certain locations in Fiordland. Restricted to the mountains near Haast, Fiordland, Stewart Island, and sanctuaries. Foraging produces clear audible sniffling. Males give a series of clear rising whistles while females give a harsh throaty wail. Both sexes repeat their call many times. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Southern Cassowary,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Casuariiformes,Casuariidae,Casuarius casuarius,https://ebird.org/species/soucas1,"Enormous flightless bird with dark glossy plumage and large, horn-like plate on colorful head with two red neck wattles. Unlikely to be confused with other species. Hatchlings are brown and strongly striped. Juvenile and Immature birds are similar to adults but browner and with an absent or developing head-plate. Found in dense tropical rainforest, where it can be seen crossing roads, or along roadsides."
0,Southern Citril,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra hyposticta,https://ebird.org/species/soucit1,"Small seedeater with a sharp bill and forked tail. The upperparts are olive-green and the underparts pale yellow with some streaking. Males and females are similar. Found at middle and high elevations in a variety of habitats, including forest edge, gardens, cultivation, moist scrub, and woodland. Usually in small flocks. The song is a fast jumble of high-pitched twitters and whistles. Similar to Western Citril, but there is virtually no overlap in range, and further separated by the lack of a strong pale eyebrow, and the lack of a black face on the male."
0,Southern Emuwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Stipiturus malachurus,https://ebird.org/species/souemu1,"A tiny, buff-brown bird with an enormously long tail. Tail is much longer and far more spindly than that of fairywrens. Females have dark streaks on the crown and back and are a warm buffy-brown underneath. Males are the similar, except they have a sky-blue throat. Typically very shy, they live in coastal heath-land in southern Australia and are unlikely to be seen unless you are actively looking for them."
0,Southern Fiscal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius collaris,https://ebird.org/species/soufis1,"A common black-and-white shrike of open country that perches upright. Singles and pairs are conspicuous on perches 1 to 10 meters above the ground in grassland, light and dense woodland, savanna, and modified habitats. They perch for extended periods and swoop down on insects and small vertebrates that they catch on the ground; these are sometimes impaled on thorns and stored for later consumption. The underparts of the similar Northern Fiscal are cleaner and whiter than the dingy gray underparts of the Southern Fiscal."
0,Southern Fulmar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Fulmarus glacialoides,https://ebird.org/species/souful1,"Distinctive, medium-sized silvery-gray petrel. Breeds around Antarctica, but regular migrant north to Chile, especially in winter. Often in groups and regularly follows ships; can be seen feeding and scavenging with giant-petrels at sewage outflows along shore of Strait of Magellan. Note white flash in dark wing-tip, and at close range the pink bill with black tip and bluish tubenose."
0,Southern Giant-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Macronectes giganteus,https://ebird.org/species/angpet1,"Widespread and fairly common; readily seen from shore and ferries in Tierra del Fuego. Giant-Petrels are known as vultures of the Southern Ocean and can scavenge with gulls at sewage outflows or with albatrosses at fishing boats; often follows ships. Very large (size of smaller albatross) with a very big pale bill that always has a diagnostic pale greenish tip. Plumage varies; most birds are dark overall or with whitish head, rarely whitish head and underparts; scarce white morph is snow-white overall with scattered black feathers."
0,Southern Ground-Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucorvidae,Bucorvus leadbeateri,https://ebird.org/species/soghor1,"This enormous, sociable, ground-loving hornbill is easily recognized. The adult male has an extensive brilliant red face and throat wattles, while the adult female has purple-blue skin in the center of the red throat patch. The immature is scruffy with yellowish facial skin. In flight, this huge bird is black with extensive white wingtips. Family groups walk slowly through bushy savanna and grassland, foraging for large invertebrates and small vertebrates. In the early morning, dominant pairs duet with a deep-bass booming, “oooh..oooh..ooh-oh”, which can be heard several kilometers away."
0,Southern Hill Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Gracula indica,https://ebird.org/species/sohmyn1,"Glossy black myna of southern India and Sri Lanka. Note white wing patches, bright orange bill, and yellow head wattles. Inhabits foothill forests, where it is most often encountered high up in the canopy in pairs or small flocks. Gives various croaks and screams, but is less vocally accomplished than the very similar Common Hill Myna, which does not overlap in range."
0,Southern Hyliota,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hyliotidae,Hyliota australis,https://ebird.org/species/souhyl1,"Mid-sized, generic-looking warbler-like bird. Males have a matte black back, a white wing patch, and very pale yellowish underparts. Females are similar, but browner on the back. Found mainly in broadleaf savanna, and locally in humid forest. Usually in pairs or small groups, which will join mixed-species feeding flocks. The quiet vocalizations include chatty calls and trills. Very similar to Yellow-bellied Hyliota. In most of the range, Southern males distinguished by the smaller white patch on the wing, and females by their browner upperparts. In Uganda and Kenya, males are extremely similar, but Southern can still be recognized by its non-glossy black back."
0,Southern Lapwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Vanellus chilensis,https://ebird.org/species/soulap1,"Raucous, conspicuous shorebird. Distinctive color pattern with black breast, white belly, gray head, and bronzy shoulder. Wings boldly patterned in flight.

0,Southern Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne elegans,https://ebird.org/species/soumar,"Large swallow with pointed wings and slightly forked tail. Males are deep iridescent purple; females are also entirely dark, but are brownish below, with faint scaling. Migrates within South America; at some times of year, occurs with other very similar martin species, making identification difficult. Females lack the light belly of similar Purple and Gray-breasted Martins; males essentially indistinguishable from Purple Martin."
0,Southern Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus velatus,https://ebird.org/species/afmwea,"This red-eyed masked-weaver has a lightly streaked green back and pink-brown legs. The breeding male has a black face mask with a narrow black band on the forehead above the bill. The female and juvenile are dull. The species is an abundant resident throughout open savanna and semi-arid areas, nesting colonially above water or in large trees. Many similar-looking weavers do not overlap in range. The larger and more robust male Village Weaver differs from Southern Masked-Weaver by having a more mottled back; the female Village Weaver has a stouter, more robust bill and a duller red eye."
0,Southern Pied-Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides bicolor,https://ebird.org/species/sopbab1,"A striking black-and-white babbler lacking any facial markings. Groups of 3-15 range through arid savanna, preferring areas with thorn trees, where they associate with Red-billed Buffalo-Weaver and Crimson-breasted Gonolek. The species gives a high-pitched aggravated babbling in group chorus. The similar Bare-cheeked Babbler differs from the Southern Pied-Babbler by having bare black skin patches near the eye and a rufous nape."
0,Southern Pochard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Netta erythrophthalma,https://ebird.org/species/soupoc1,Very dark-looking duck with a broad white wing band that is visible in flight. Males are mostly glossy black with chestnut wings and a pale gray bill. Females have a different head pattern with white at the bill base and a crescent behind the eye. Inhabits lakes and pools with abundant vegetation.
0,Southern Red Bishop,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Euplectes orix,https://ebird.org/species/redbis,"A small, dumpy sparrow-like weaver. The breeding male is a mix of velvety vermilion and black; the narrow black forecrown is diagnostic. The female and non-breeding male are nondescript, with a short tail and strong buff eyebrow, and are difficult to tell apart from other bishops. Pairs and small flocks are always close to water when breeding, and mixed-species colonies occur in reedbeds and swampy grassland, but they disperse into adjacent scrub in the non-breeding season, often in flocks. The song is an extended fizzling sizzle. Breeding males of other red bishop species either have no black forehead, or have a much more extensive black crown."
0,Southern Rockhopper Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes chrysocome,https://ebird.org/species/rocpen1,"The smallest of the crested penguins. Note the thin yellow eyebrows that, once past the eyes, flare out toward the rear of the head. The species consists of two subspecies, the Eastern and Western Rockhopper Penguins. The Western Rockhopper Penguin breeds on offshore islands off southern Chile and Argentina and on the Falkland Islands, while the Eastern Rockhopper Penguin breeds on various subantarctic islands around New Zealand and the southern Indian Ocean. The Eastern has even eyebrows with pink skin at the base of the bill; the Western has black skin at the base of the bill, with an uneven eyebrow shape. Vagrants occasionally reach the Snares Islands. Distinguished from Snares Penguin by thinner eyebrow and smaller bill, and from Moseley’s Rockhopper Penguin by shorter, less flowing crest."
0,Southern Screamer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anhimidae,Chauna torquata,https://ebird.org/species/souscr1,"Huge and odd-looking gray gooselike species with long red legs. Note the wispy crest on the back of the head, the bare red face, and a broad dark collar with a thin white collar above it. In flight shows white underwings. Occurs in wetlands, including marshes and lakes where it may gather in big flocks. Has a very loud and far-carrying call, usually delivered in a duet."
0,Southern Scrub-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Sublegatus modestus,https://ebird.org/species/sosfly1,"Small, dull flycatcher. Medium brown with a light yellow belly, and two whitish wingbars. Breeds in dry scrub and open woodlands across much of southern South America; also a common austral migrant into Amazonia, where it is found in secondary and successional growth.

Overall dark blue in color, slightly paler below, with a white throat and belly, a white patch behind the cheek, and a white spot behind the nostril. Note the pale silvery-blue stripe down the back to the tail, the whitish flecks on the head and wing, and the bright red legs. Unmistakable. Voice is a simple, high-pitched “tseep,” often given in flight."
0,Southern Tchagra,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Tchagra tchagra,https://ebird.org/species/soutch1,"A gray-brown bushshrike with rufous wings and a diagnostic brown central crown lacking black stripes above the bold pale eyebrow. Pairs skulk close to the ground, where they hop and glean for insects in coastal scrub, tangled thickets, and forest edges. The species performs an aerial display, its wings making a “prrrrrp” rattle sound before it sings a rapid descending, slowing series of musical “chew” notes. It also gives harsh scolding calls. The similar Brown-crowned Tchagra differs from the larger Southern Tchagra by having a smaller, daintier bill and a plain brown central crown that is bordered by black stripes."
0,Southern Variable Pitohui,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Pitohui uropygialis,https://ebird.org/species/varpit3,"A fairly large bird of mainly secondary lowland and foothill forest edge. As the name suggests, a variably plumaged bird. Males mostly have a black hood, wing and tail with belly and back, chestnut or orange-brown. Males and females of some races have a brown head. Very similar to Hooded Pitohui, but Southern Variable is usually found at lower elevation and has black rather than brown above the base of the tail. Song, a varied, jumbled warble."
0,Southern Whiteface,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Aphelocephala leucopsis,https://ebird.org/species/souwhi1,"Small bird with stubby bill. Upperparts grayish brown, underparts whitish, with varying amounts of reddish-brown tone in flanks. White upperparts extend above the bill, hence the name. Inhabits drier open woodlands and shrublands in southern Australia, where often forages on the ground in small flocks."
0,Souza's Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius souzae,https://ebird.org/species/soushr3,"Small, slim shrike with a brown wing and tail. Note the white slash across the shoulders. Males are gray below and females buffy. Found in broadleaf woodland of miombo, mopane, and Zambezi teak. Uncommon and very localized species. Perches high in trees, but rarely on the conspicuous open perches used by most shrikes. Often in pairs. The vocalizations include an annoyed-sounding “sveeat” and low rasps. Most similar to female Red-backed Shrike, but separated by the white mark across the shoulders and lack of barring on the underparts."
0,Spangled Coquette,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Lophornis stictolophus,https://ebird.org/species/spacoq1,"Tiny, short-tailed hummingbird with disjunct range from Venezuela to southeast Ecuador. Spectacular male is mostly green with a bushy orange crest with black spots, a dark throat, a red bill, and a white band across rump. Female is duller overall with a rusty forehead and a whitish throat. Unlikely to be confused within its range, but compare with Rufous-crested Coquette (male lacks black spotting in crest and female has a brighter rusty throat). Generally rare in lowlands and foothills up to around 1,200 m. Most likely to be seen at purple Verbena flowers or in the canopy of a flowering Inga tree."
0,Spangled Cotinga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Cotinga cayana,https://ebird.org/species/spacot1,"Compact, medium-sized bird of rainforest canopy; often seen at fruiting trees or perched atop bare snags. Male plumage is stunning in good light but can appear blackish otherwise. Feeds on fruit and often commutes long distances between food sources. In western Amazonia, compare to Plum-throated Cotinga; note male Spangled’s more extensive black markings, including tail. Females recognizable by small, rounded head and scalloped plumage; both sexes have dark (not yellow) eyes."

0,Spectacled Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Rubigula erythropthalmos,https://ebird.org/species/spebul1,"Dull brown bulbul; paler below than above. Thin orangish eyering around the bright red eye is diagnostic, but not always easy to see. Very similar in appearance to slightly larger Red-eyed Bulbul, as well as to the red-eyed Bornean form of Cream-vented Bulbul; Spectacled is best separated by its combination of stronger contrast of the gray-washed head and breast with the rufous-brown wings and rump. Throat coloration of Spectacled is intermediate between the starkly pale throat of Cream-vented and the brown-suffused throat of Red-eyed, and its bill appears smaller and sharper than in the former two species.

Note that the patch between the eye and bill (lores) on females is a fraction paler than the bill (in Variegated Fairywren the lores are much darker than the bill). This species is fairly common in arid inland Australia, as well as in southwest Western Australia."
0,Splendid Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis splendidus,https://ebird.org/species/spgsta1,"Large, chunky dark starling. In poor light looks black, but good light reveals purple, green, blue, and copper irridesence, and black spots on the shoulders. Found in and around humid forest at low and middle elevations. Usually in small flocks. Gives a wide variety of scolding, rasping, squealing, and liquid notes. Larger than other glossy starlings, except for the localized Principe Starling. Separated from that species by Splendid Starling’s purplish rather than bronzy underparts."
0,Splendid Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris coccinigastrus,https://ebird.org/species/splsun2,"A fairly large, long-billed sunbird in which males and females are very different. Males are dark, with an iridescent multi-colored hood and a black belly. Females have olive-brown upperparts, yellowish underparts with blurry streaking, and a vague pale eye-stripe. Found in lush savanna, gardens, coastal scrub, forest clearings, and forest edge. Male similar to male Superb and Johanna’s Sunbird, but separated by the black rather than red belly. Female similar to female Copper Sunbird, but more streaked below, with a less distinct pale eyebrow. The song is a slow series of several low-pitched whistled notes. The most common call is a repeated scratchy scolding."
0,Spotless Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Zapornia tabuensis,https://ebird.org/species/spocra2,"Small dark crake with red eye and red orbital ring. Upperparts dark brown, underparts blue-gray, with red legs and short black bill. Inhabits wetlands where there is dense vegetation surrounding the water. Quite skittish and often difficult to observe. A wide variety of calls include a slow, repeated ""kek"" and a bubbling, accelerating ""motorboat"" call."
0,Spotless Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Sturnus unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/sposta1,"Dark purple starling without any spots in summer. Same size and shape as European Starling. In winter can show some restricted pale spotting below but still very uniform. Found in short grassy areas, farms, parks, and gardens. The song is similar to European Starling, including lots of mimicry. Nests in cavities."
0,Spotted Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Hylophylax naevioides,https://ebird.org/species/spoant1,"Stunning antbird, small and boldly patterned. Rotund and short-tailed. Male has white belly with band of black spots across chest, gray head, and rufous back. Female more washed out, but similar pattern. Usually seen singly or in pairs in understory of forest, often following a mixed flock or army ant swarm. Stuttered song is a series of slightly wheezy whistles, descending in pitch."
0,Spotted Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Hylopezus macularius,https://ebird.org/species/spoant6,"Shy, seldom-seen (but often heard) resident of lowland rainforest. In dim understory note long, pale legs, tailless shape, spotted breast, and wide buffy eyering; looks small. Hops on the ground searching for insects in leaf litter; may fly up to a low perch to assess an observer or respond to playback.

0,Spotted Bamboowren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Psilorhamphus guttatus,https://ebird.org/species/spobam1,"Strange-looking small bird with a slender bill and a rather long tail. Found in bamboo stands in humid forests and second growth where it can be very hard to see. Males have a spotted gray head, back, and breast and a brown tail, rump, and belly, which is faintly barred. Females are similar but browner. The song can be delivered loudly or quietly and can be easily overlooked."
0,Spotted Barbtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Premnoplex brunnescens,https://ebird.org/species/spobar1,"A small dark bird that creeps around mossy forest understory, frequently hanging upside-down like a nuthatch. Overall dark brown with warm buffy throat and spotting down the chest. Sexes alike. Combination of dark plumage, behavior, and spotting render this species distinctive. Found singly or in pairs, often following a mixed flock through the forest. Listen for its fast, descending, tinkling trill."
0,Spotted Berrypecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Melanocharitidae,Melanocharis crassirostris,https://ebird.org/species/spober1,"A small, rare bird of mid-montane forest. Male is dark gray above and pale gray below with a slight, pale tuft on the side. Females are heavily spotted with olive-edged flight feathers. Eastern and western birds differ. Eastern birds have longer, thinner bills and the females, darker bellies with more distinct spots. Male is similar to female Mid-mountain and Fan-tailed Berrypeckers but is longer-billed and shorter-tailed. Female is similar to Mottled Berryhunter but is much smaller. Call, a thin, high-pitch “tsiip”."
0,Spotted Bowerbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Chlamydera maculata,https://ebird.org/species/spobow1,"A brownish, mottled, strongly marked bowerbird with warm brown tones overall and a small pink crest on the nape. Loud rasping calls include hisses and squawks. Occurs in open woodlands, as well as in gardens and town parks within its range. Males decorate their avenue bowers with pale objects such as small bones and shells. Western Bowerbird is paler, and its range is further west. Spotted Bowerbird lives in inland portions of Queensland and New South Wales."
0,Spotted Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella thoracica,https://ebird.org/species/spobuw3,"Furtive brown warbler. Brown above and pale below, with a striped vent. Namesake spotting is variable; Himalayan birds have a necklace of dark spots, while central Chinese birds have a much lighter stippled patch on the chest. Extremely difficult to tell apart from non-singing Baikal Bush Warbler where the two overlap: in Spotted, look for a stronger gray wash on the neck and chest, and warmer-toned upperparts. Sichuan and Chinese Bush Warblers can also be similar, but average more warmly-colored, with plainer underparts. Spotted Bush Warbler breeds in dense, shrubby, stunted growth near treeline and winters in reedbeds, wet meadows, and grassy edges. Furtive and skulking; listen for its song, a long series of curious, echoing, clicking phrases: “pritti-kee-kee-dee, pritti-kee-kee-dee.”"
0,Spotted Buttonquail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Turnicidae,Turnix ocellatus,https://ebird.org/species/spobut2,"A medium-sized ground bird of mixed habitat from the lowlands to the mountains of Luzon. Brown on the back with a strong checkered pattern, black spots on the wing, a rufous chest, and a speckled head. The throat is black in the female and white in the male.

0,Spotted Catbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Ailuroedus maculosus,https://ebird.org/species/spocat2,"Chunky rainforest bird with emerald green upperparts, black spot below the dark red eye, and green-olive underparts with extensive pale spotting. Inhabits the Wet Tropics of northern Queensland (Cairns region), thus does not overlap with similar Green Catbird. Forages mostly in middle and upper story of the rainforest. Compare female and juvenile Satin Bowerbird (with blue eye, darker bill). Spotted Catbird is well known for its characteristic catlike yowling call."
0,Spotted Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Porzana porzana,https://ebird.org/species/spocra1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa and Asia. Breeds in fresh wetlands with sedges, wet meadows, but migrants are often in reed beds and brackish marshes. Retiring and rarely seen, but sometimes comes out at muddy edges, mainly early and late in the day. About same size as Water Rail (other crakes appreciably smaller), but with short yellow bill with reddish base, legs greenish. Note dense whitish spotting and speckling on neck and breast."
0,Spotted Crocias,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Laniellus albonotatus,https://ebird.org/species/spocro1,"Long-tailed and thick-billed relative of the laughingthrushes, found only in foothill and lower montane forests on Java. Hops about in the upper levels of the forest, often in small single-species groups, as well as mixed flocks. When seen from below, note the bright white throat, black face, pale yellowish belly, and dark undertail with white-tipped feathers. If seen at a level angle, note rust-and-white striped back and sides. Fast, repetitive, up-and-down song is often given by multiple birds at once."
0,Spotted Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Streptopelia chinensis,https://ebird.org/species/spodov,"A common garden bird throughout much of Asia, found in open forests, fields, and parks; introduced to several regions around the world. Often tame and approachable. Brown overall with a rosy breast and a unique white-spotted black nape patch. Plumage shows slight regional variation: western birds have dark centers to wing feathers, lacking in eastern birds. Turtle-doves are larger, have black centers to wing feathers and stripes rather than spots on the neck. Coos loudly and often: “coo-a-roooo”."
0,Spotted Elachura,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Elachuridae,Elachura formosa,https://ebird.org/species/spwbab1,"Tiny wrenlike skulker with a large-headed and short-tailed profile. Brown overall with galaxy-like white spotting across the body and thick brick-red barring on the wings and tail. Difficult to see; almost always detected by its song, a drawn-out series of high chinking notes; responsive to whistled imitations, but very shy regardless and only infrequently breaks cover. Typically found in hilly forests, particularly next to well-shaded small streams and other damp areas."
0,Spotted Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura perlata,https://ebird.org/species/spofan1,"A starburst of vanilla sprinkles across the breast makes this black-and-white fantail unmistakable. Irrepressibly hyperactive, it is often an active member of mixed-species foraging flocks in the middle and upper levels of forest. Song is pleasant and comprises burbling liquid chimes: “chi-ch’ch-chlipchilip-ching”, with the last note having a resonant, pinging quality."
0,Spotted Tody-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Todirostrum maculatum,https://ebird.org/species/sptfly1,"Tiny, subtly colorful flycatcher of riparian and secondary growth. Large-headed with a flat boat-shaped bill. Yellow with a gray head and fine black streaking all over. Song an even-paced series of high chip notes, usually transitioning into doubled notes, “peet, peet, peet-it, peet-it, peet-it, …”."
0,Spotted Forktail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Enicurus maculatus,https://ebird.org/species/spofor1,"Stunning galaxy-like white spotting on the back separates this species from all other forktails. Picks its way through well-shaded forest streams and creeks, particularly in rocky areas; breeds in foothills and mountains, but sometimes descends in the winter. Frequently gives a loud buzzy “brzeeee!” as well as high thin whistles."
0,Spotted Green Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Caloenas maculata,https://ebird.org/species/spgpig1,"Extinct, last reported in 1783. Extinct. Probably formerly native to an island or island group in the South Pacific."
0,Spotted Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Ixonotus guttatus,https://ebird.org/species/spogre1,"A distinctive rainforest greenbul with olive-brown upperparts, pale underparts, white spots on the wings, and white outer tail feathers. Found in the canopy of humid forest at low and middle elevations, usually in restless flocks of 5-15 individuals, but occasionally gathers by the dozens. Often flicks out one wing, an odd and distinctive behavior. Somewhat similar to nicators, but found in the canopy, and easily separated by the unhooked bill, the white tail edges, and the white rather than yellow spots on the back. Very vocal, constantly giving a penetrating “stick” call."
