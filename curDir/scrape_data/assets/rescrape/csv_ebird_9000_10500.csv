Forages in wet patches on the forest floor. Vocalizations unknown."
0,Sulphury Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannopsis sulphurea,https://ebird.org/species/sulfly1,"Medium-sized flycatcher with a plumage pattern—brownish above, yellow below—that recalls Tropical Kingbird, but Sulphury Flycatcher is much darker gray on the face and head and has a contrasting white throat. Inhabits a variety of forest types but is most common in flooded and edge habitats with many palms—especially common in Moriche palm stands in savanna regions. Generally sluggish; usually in pairs, which take inconspicuous perches and sally to surrounding vegetation for insects (unlike kingbirds, which sit on exposed perches and tend to catch insects from the air). Highly vocal; distinctive, loud calls have electric quality and are usually heard before birds are seen."
0,Sultan Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Melanochlora sultanea,https://ebird.org/species/sultit1,"Highly social inhabitant of lowland forests, unlike any other tit in both size and coloration; coal-black with a bright yellow belly and sharply upswept crest. Closer in size to a medium-sized bulbul than to a Japanese or Coal Tit. Tends to stick to the canopy, where it readily associates with other species in mixed flocks. Very vocal, often giving squeaky, shrill calls. Song consists of repeated high-pitched whistles, sometimes with an inflected quality."
0,Sulu Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Anthracoceros montani,https://ebird.org/species/sulhor2,"A large bird of lowland and montane forest on the Sulu Islands, although probably only remaining on Tawi-Tawi.

Compare with Horsfield’s, Abbott’s, White-breasted, and Short-tailed Babblers; note large flesh-colored bill and lack of any warm color on the back or sides. Dull, skulky, and generally uncommon, this undergrowth-dweller can be difficult to get a good look at, and is more readily heard than seen. Forages singly and in pairs, typically on or close to the ground. Song is a variable, cheery up-and-down series of notes; in southern parts of the species’ range, singing birds may add a trill at the end of a song. Call is an explosive, rapid chatter."
0,Sumatran Cochoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Cochoa beccarii,https://ebird.org/species/sumcoc1,"Bulky and sluggish inhabitant of Sumatra’s highland forests. Resembles a cross between a large thrush and a small crow; both sexes are glossy black with an electric-blue tail, wing panel, and crown. Males have a dark face, whereas females have a buffy one. Dull naked red skin around the eye can be evident at close range. Like other cochoas, its inactive habits can make this species difficult to see as it perches up in dense vegetation. Song is a haunting mournful whistle."
0,Sumatran Drongo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicruridae,Dicrurus sumatranus,https://ebird.org/species/sumdro1,"Glossy large-billed drongo with glossy blue-sheened wings and tail. Also note bright red eyes, iridescent speckling around the throat and neck, and flared broad-tipped tail. Endemic to Sumatra, where it is the only regularly-occurring “Hair-crested type” drongo, a group which has undergone extensive taxonomic changes recently; some older field guides may refer to this taxa as either Hair-crested or Spangled Drongo. Inhabits foothill forests, where it often associates with mixed flocks in the upper and middle levels of forest. Can be a source of confusion with other drongos, such as Black, Lesser Racket-tailed, Bronzed, and Crow-billed, but note habitat, distinctive tail shape, and flat-headed profile.

0,Sumatran Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus poliolophus,https://ebird.org/species/shtfro3,"A Sumatran endemic, this medium-sized nightbird is limited to foothill and montane forests between 1200 and 2000 meters, only rarely straying to lower elevations. Nocturnal and difficult to see by day as it perches quietly in the middle levels of forest. A relatively short-tailed species, Sumatran has extensive clean white scaling on the underparts. Gives a variety of vocalizations, including an eerily falling whistled trill, as well as various squawks, shrieks, and shorter whistles. Altitudinal range mostly separates it from other small frogmouths, but in situations of potential overlap, note short tail, well-demarcated (not messy) and extensive white scaling on underparts, and different vocalizations."
0,Sumatran Ground-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Carpococcyx viridis,https://ebird.org/species/sugcuc1,"Incredibly elusive and rare, this is a highly sought-after ground-dweller. Found only in primary hill forest (300-1400 meters) in western Sumatra. Unmistakable if seen well; note long broad tail, burly chest, dark head, long legs, finely barred breast, and brightly-colored blue-and-pink bare facial skin. Like many other terrestrial birds, tends to run away when spooked. Very difficult to see, and best detected by its mournful, high-pitched, and slightly hollow whistled song: “gwheuw-oh-eewo’eh!” Also gives a harsh, buzzy call that sounds like someone blowing their nose."
0,Sumatran Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Garrulax bicolor,https://ebird.org/species/sumlau1,"Stunning Sumatran endemic, now sadly in heavy decline due to poaching for the cagebird trade. Extirpated throughout much of former range, and now only present in more remote montane forests. Combination of dark body, bright white head, and black “mascara” is unique and unmistakable, but shy and reclusive habits make this bird more readily heard than seen; groups may suddenly erupt into a collective raucous cackling song which carries a considerable distance. Also gives a variety of hoots, rattles, and churrs."
0,Sumatran Leafbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chloropseidae,Chloropsis media,https://ebird.org/species/sumlea1,"Uncommon and declining Sumatran endemic, restricted to foothill forest at 600-1000 meters.

0,Sumichrast's Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Hylorchilus sumichrasti,https://ebird.org/species/sumwre1,"Very local in humid evergreen forest of limestone (karst) lowlands and foothills in northern Oaxaca and adjacent Veracruz; endemic. Stays on or near the ground, moving quickly among limestone boulders, popping in and out of caves and crevices. Like most wrens, heard more often than seen, but can be curious; sometimes appears at close range, bobbing and holding its tail cocked. Distinctive: rather chunky with a very long bill, a pale gray face marked with a dark cheek patch, and a rusty breast."
0,Summer Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Piranga rubra,https://ebird.org/species/sumtan,"Large tanager with a hefty bill. Adult males are completely red; immature males are dull yellow-olive with blotchy patches of red. Females are variable in color, ranging from pale dull yellow to brighter orange. Can be confused with female Scarlet Tanager; Summer has a longer, paler bill and less contrast between wing and body color. Also compare with dustier-looking, stouter-billed Hepatic Tanager. Breeds in mature forests, favoring mixed deciduous and pine in the southeastern U.S. and riparian corridors in the western U.S. and northern Mexico. Extensive winter range from Mexico to Bolivia, where it can be found in any wooded area. Often gives a short, descending rattle “pit-a-tuck.”"
0,Sun Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Galerida modesta,https://ebird.org/species/sunlar1,"A chunky, robust lark that has a heavy bill with a yellowish base, a densely streaked chest, and a small crest that is sometimes raised. A resident or partial migrant occupying arid open scrub, dry wooded grassland, and fields, where pairs and small groups walk confidently, pecking or digging for seeds and insects.

Occurs in savanna regions adjacent to tall forest and is often observed near forest edge or along rivers. Highly social and usually found in groups of up to several dozen individuals. Feeds on fruit and flowers, commuting long distances between food sources. Noisy, especially in flight; screeching calls are particularly grating and unlike any other parrot in range. Brown-throated Parakeets in early morning or late afternoon sunlight may appear to glow orange on the face and breast and are sometimes mistaken for Sun Parakeets; note Sun Parakeet’s very different calls and yellow color extending over the shoulders and back."
0,Sunbittern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Eurypygiformes,Eurypygidae,Eurypyga helias,https://ebird.org/species/sunbit1,"One of the most dazzling of all the world’s birds; the intricate yellow, red, and black pattern on the spread wings is truly otherworldly. When standing, rather heronlike shape but with a more horizontal posture and longer tail. Also look for striped black-and-white head and barred back. Found singly or in pairs along rivers or swamps, usually standing quietly along the shore. Listen for long whistles at dawn and dusk."

Forages on the ground and in dense vegetation, only occasionally emerging into the open."
0,Sunda Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Cuculus lepidus,https://ebird.org/species/suncuc2,"Typical Cuculus cuckoo: most adults are gray with black stripes on a white breast and belly, but some females are “hepatic”; they appear rufous overall with extensive barring. Virtually identical to Himalayan and Oriental cuckoos, which migrate through and winter in Sunda’s range; look for Sunda’s more contrasting darker gray upperparts, wider bars on the underparts, and buffier unmarked vent. Juvenile is dark grayish black above with white edging to the feathers. Like most cuckoos, more often heard than seen; listen for its 2–3 note hooting song, which averages higher than that of Oriental. A species of montane and foothill forest."
0,Sunda Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina larvata,https://ebird.org/species/suncus1,"Chunky, dark gray bird with a dark face.

0,Sunda Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus cornutus,https://ebird.org/species/sunfro1,"Small frogmouth with piercing yellow eyes. Found in lowland and lower foothill forest, plantations, and forest edge. Both sexes are variable, but males average more strongly-patterned while females are more often rufous. White patterning on the underparts and wings varies between discrete “scales” and blotchy patches. Similar Blyth’s Frogmouth has less extensive white in its plumage, whereas Bornean and Sumatran frogmouths (both of which favor higher elevations than Sunda) are shorter-tailed; in addition, the latter has much more white on the underparts. Gives a harsh, grating caw, as well as clear whistles and a brief rolling series of harsh notes."
0,Sunda Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Garrulax palliatus,https://ebird.org/species/sunlau1,"Forest laughingthrush of montane and submontane areas. Slate-gray head and chest, chestnut wings and tail. Pale blue eyering gives it a startled appearance. Forages close to or on the ground, noisily flipping leaf litter. Also visits campsites and trailheads like Chestnut-hooded Laughingthrush, but Sunda is comparatively shier. Raucous song starts off with a few distinct hooting notes and promptly descends into a jumble of chaotic noise, often giving away its presence in the undergrowth. Also gives squeaky yelps, quieter “chup” notes, and dry rattles."
0,Sunda Minivet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Pericrocotus miniatus,https://ebird.org/species/sunmin1,"Brightly-colored and long-tailed inhabitant of foothill and montane forests in Java and Sumatra (1200-2700 meters).

Often sings during the day, and can be mistaken for a barbet, but the exact pattern of toots is unlike any barbet. Visually, could be mistaken for a scops-owl, but separated by the distinctive voice, the broad brown streaks below, and the lack of ear tufts."
0,Sunda Pygmy Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Yungipicus moluccensis,https://ebird.org/species/bncwoo2,"Small plain woodpecker of wooded areas from primary rainforest to parklands and forest edges. Brownish overall with a white-striped head, a spotted back, and pale gray streaks on a buffy breast. Male has a small red speck near the back of the crown. Similar Gray-capped Woodpecker is black-and-white, with a less cleanly striped head, cleaner underparts, and unevenly distributed pale spotting on the back and wings. Sunda’s call is a high-pitched rattling trill."
0,Sunda Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myiomela diana,https://ebird.org/species/sunrob1,"Medium-sized robin of montane and foothill forests in Java and Sumatra. Male is dark blue, with a bright white spot on the forehead. Female is warm earthy cinnamon-brown, with a grayish belly. Dark belly and male’s white forehead (instead of eyebrow) serve to distinguish this species from blue robins and shortwings. Shy and furtive, typically moving about quietly on or close to the ground, often in pairs. Song consists of a short series of beautiful musical, fluty notes; rising in Sumatran birds, generally descending in Javan birds."
0,Sunda Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus lempiji,https://ebird.org/species/susowl2,"Small brown owl with large dark eyes and small, soft-looking ear tufts. Dark brown, almost black, eyes separate it from otherwise similar species such as Mountain, Oriental, and Rajah scops-owls. Reddish Scops-Owl is also dark-eyed, but it is darker-faced and tinged with rufous overall. Like most other small scops-owls, Sunda is more readily heard than seen: it gives yelping hoots at widely-spaced intervals. Relatively tolerant of human habitation; often encountered in gardens, plantations, and parks, as well as forests."
0,Sunda Teal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas gibberifrons,https://ebird.org/species/suntea1,"Small, dull, brown duck with ruby-red eyes.

Calls include a dry “tchit” and a dry descending rattle."
0,Sungrebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Heliornithidae,Heliornis fulica,https://ebird.org/species/sungre1,"Retiring, small swimming bird of tropical lowlands. It’s not a grebe and it doesn’t like the sun; instead it favors slow-moving shady streams, mangroves, quiet ponds, and lake edges. Swims with a slight head-jerking motion and flies off low over the water when disturbed or climbs up into low branches and tangles; does not dive. The striped head and neck and stout pointed bill are distinctive. The cheeks are white on the male and orangish on the female."
0,Sunset Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Trichoglossus forsteni,https://ebird.org/species/railor3,"A fairly large long-tailed parrot with unmistakable striking coloration. Green with a dark purple head, a red bill, a lime-green collar, and a broad red chest patch above deep purple underparts. Juveniles duller, with a brownish bill.

0,Superb Fairywren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Malurus cyaneus,https://ebird.org/species/supfai1,"A small bird with a long tail that is held cocked. Its tail is usually blue (except juveniles, which have brown tails). Breeding males have a pale blue crown, cheek, and back with a strong black line from the bill through the eyes and around the back of the head. Nonbreeding males are fairly plain grayish-brown birds with black bills and bright blue tails. Females have a duller blue tail and a reddish bill. Note that the patch between the eye and bill (lores) on females is a reddish color of about the same tone as the bill (in Variegated Fairywren the lores are much darker than the bill). Female Superb Fairywrens have a much cooler-grayer plumage than the warm tones of Red-backed Fairywren. This species is abundant in parks, gardens, and open woodlands around much of southeastern Australia."
0,Superb Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus superbus,https://ebird.org/species/sufdov1,"Tiny rainforest dove with white belly and white vent (compared to Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove which has a yellow belly and vent). Males have a thick black chest band and purple crown. Occurs in eastern Indonesia, New Guinea, and down the east coast of Australia (where it is more common in the north).

0,Superb Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris superbus,https://ebird.org/species/supsun2,"A large, long-billed sunbird in which males and females are very different. Males are dark, with iridescent green upperparts, a bluish-purple throat and breast, and a blood-red belly. Females have olive-brown upperparts, mostly yellowish underparts, an orangish undertail, and a prominent pale eye-stripe. Found in rainforest, gallery forest, and adjacent lush savanna, mostly in the canopy. Similar to Johanna’s Sunbird, but larger; male is separated by the bluish-purple throat and breast and female by the unstriped underparts. One common call is distinctive and unusual for a sunbird, sounding more like a puffback: a nasal “kyyep.” The song is a few staccato clear notes, sometimes followed by a fast jumble."
0,Superciliaried Hemispingus,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Thlypopsis superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/suphem1,"A small warbler-like tanager with significant variation across its range. Most birds are olive above and yellow below with a gray crown and obvious white eyebrow. Birds in northern and central Peru are gray above and whitish below, still with an obvious white eyebrow. Birds in western Venezuela have a yellow eyebrow. Compare with Drab Hemispingus, which is duller olive with a less obvious eyebrow, and with Citrine Warbler (especially in Venezuela, where the hemispingus also has a yellow eyebrow). Note Citrine Warbler’s wider eyebrow and paler legs. The hemispingus is usually found in pairs or small groups that forage actively in the canopy of forest or edge, often following mixed-species flocks. Occurs from around 2,200m up to treeline."
0,Superciliated Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cantorchilus superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/supwre1,"This brown-and-white wren has an amazingly loud voice for its size. It inhabits dry forest and scrub in western Ecuador and northwestern Peru.

Birds in the eastern part of the range show a lot of contrast on the underparts, while western birds are duller. Found in habitats adjacent to water, including papyrus swamp, marsh, riverbanks, and lakeshores. Not very vocal, but the quiet song is a mix of rasps, trills, and high-pitched whistles. Duller western birds can be confused with Cassin’s Flycatcher, which is also often found near water, but are brown rather than gray overall."
0,Swamp Francolin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Ortygornis gularis,https://ebird.org/species/swafra1,"Brown francolin with an orange throat and white-striped underparts.

Note distinct pale barring on upperparts and bright reddish legs. Birds in West Mexico are paler and grayer overall, those in East Mexico and Central America have a rusty-colored breast and belly."
0,Thrush Nightingale,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Luscinia luscinia,https://ebird.org/species/thrnig1,"Very similar to Common Nightingale, but more dusky brown (not reddish-brown) with a mottled brown breast (not plain and sandy). Their songs can be confusingly similar, but the Thrush Nightingale is more monotonous, less varied, and slower, resembling that of Song Thrush. Found in thick, damp, deciduous forest as well as well-wooded parks and gardens. Feeds on invertebrates and berries."
0,Tibetan Babax,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Pterorhinus koslowi,https://ebird.org/species/tibbab1,"A russet-brown babbler with pale eyes and a slightly curved black bill. Endemic to the eastern end of the Tibetan Plateau, where it inhabits areas with scrubby bushes and stunted trees. Generally, not as often seen around habitation as the larger, grayer Giant Babax (no range overlap), but will sometimes be seen taking handouts at monasteries. Forages on the ground, usually in pairs or small flocks."
0,Tibetan Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus maximus,https://ebird.org/species/tibbla1,"Dark and robust inhabitant of open subalpine areas with sparse vegetation, such as shrubby slopes, gardens, and plantations. Seldom seen in dense forests. Adult males are inky black with a bright orange bill and no eyering. Females look similar, but are dark brown instead of black with a dark orange bill. Very similar to Indian and Chinese Blackbirds, but Tibetan Blackbirds are larger and more uniformly dark than either Indian or Chinese Blackbirds."
0,Tibetan Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza koslowi,https://ebird.org/species/tibbun1,"Handsome thickset bunting restricted to a small part of the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau where it inhabits scrubby slopes above the timberline. Unmistakable in its range; no other bunting in the area combines its size, brick-orange back, and gray belly. Male has a striking black-and-white head pattern while female is gray-headed with weak streaking. Song is an unmusical and unremarkable series of high, sharp “pi-pi-pipipew” notes."
0,Tibetan Eared-Pheasant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Crossoptilon harmani,https://ebird.org/species/whieap2,"Distinctive slate-gray pheasant with a bright red face, scraggly fan-shaped tail, and bizarre white whiskers (the namesake “ears”). Also note black cap, pale gray rump, and whitish belly. Restricted to the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, where it inhabits areas with dense scrubby or brushy cover. Typically at 3000-5000 meters, though it is known to descend in the winter. Regularly found around monasteries which put food out for wildlife. Forages on the ground in small to medium-sized flocks. Can be vocal, giving high-pitched grunts and a rising squeal: “gu-tse-WEEW!"""
0,Tibetan Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Melanocorypha maxima,https://ebird.org/species/tiblar1,"Huge bulky lark with a sharp, slightly decurved bill. Pale brown above and off-white below, with a pale brow stripe, distinct brownish ear patch, and a black mark on the neck near the shoulder. Has a less contrasting head pattern than Calandra Lark and Bimaculated Lark, but is overall more strongly patterned than female Black Lark. Distinctively blade-like bill also distinguishes this species from the former two. In flight, snowy white tail edges and back wing edges are eye-catchingly prominent; Calandra Lark has minimal white on the tail tips, and Bimaculated Lark lacks white on either wings or tail. Found in high plateau regions, where it prefers rather wet areas, often on the margins of lakes, marshes, and flooded pastures. Song, given in flight, includes rolling warbles and buzzy grating notes. Calls resemble harsh, buzzy phrases from song."

Male has short but prominent black mustache and a dark bill. Female lacks the mustache, but has an orange bill and a pale white eyebrow stripe faintly resembling that of female and immature House Sparrows. Flashing white wing patches are only prominent when in flight. Confusingly, the Black-winged Snowfinch (Montifringilla adamsi) is occasionally referred to as the Tibetan Snowfinch in older field guides."
0,Tickell's Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis tickelliae,https://ebird.org/species/tibfly3,"Attractive medium-sized flycatcher with blue upperparts and orange-and-white underparts, with the most orange on the chest and the throat. Male is more intensely-colored overall than the female. Smaller-billed profile, less extensive orange, and paler face distinguish this species from male Hill Blue Flycatcher. Extensive orange on the throat separates Tickell’s from Blue-throated Flycatcher. Favors open hill forests as well as forest edge, particularly in drier, scrubby areas, often close to water. Both sexes give a pleasant high-pitched tinkling song. Calls include dry rattles and metallic clinks."
0,Tickell's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus affinis,https://ebird.org/species/tilwar1,"Brown-and-yellow leaf warbler without a wingbar. Breeds in stony shrubbery, primarily in the high Himalayas and the Trans-Himalaya. Winters throughout the Indian Subcontinent south of the Himalayas, but is most abundant in shrubbery in the northeast Indian plains and in the high Western Ghats. Resembles Sulphur-bellied Warbler, but has a yellower cheek and underparts, and shows little contrast between the eyebrow and the throat. Tickell’s spends less time on or near the ground than Sulphur-bellied, tends to flock, and often participates in mixed-species foraging flocks."
0,Tickell's Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/ticthr1,"Both sexes of this thrush are fairly uniformly-colored: the male is predominantly blue-gray and the female is warm brown with a slight buffy wash to the underparts. May be confused with Indian Blackbird in southwestern wintering range, but both sexes are paler and smaller than their respective counterparts of that species. Breeds in open forest and forest edge in hilly and submontane areas; winters in similar habitat at lower altitudes. Sings melodic warbling and buzzing phrases; also gives a short bubbly bursts of “chup” notes."
0,Ticking Doradito,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Pseudocolopteryx citreola,https://ebird.org/species/ticdor1,"Very local little bird of fresh and brackish marshes and adjacent weedy vegetation in lowlands. Departs Chile in the winter (mainly late March to mid-October) for unknown areas east of the Andes. Usually inconspicuous, hopping low in bushes and weeds, but sings from atop a bush or tall rush stalk. Distinctive in Chilean range: underparts are bright yellow, upperparts plain olive-brown with paler wingbars and soft rusty cap. Similar species occur east of the Andes."
0,Tiger Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius tigrinus,https://ebird.org/species/tigshr1,"Small, short-tailed shrike with a heavy-headed appearance. Found in lowland forests, edges, and parks. Male has an ash-gray head, an inky black mask, white underparts, and scaly chestnut wings. Female is less contrasting, with a patchy brown-and-gray crown, a smaller black mask, and black barring on the flanks and wings. Juveniles have brown heads and backs, and a brown-scaled belly; due to their lack of a mask, they have a large-eyed appearance. Juveniles can be similar to juvenile Bull-headed and Brown shrikes, but both of those species have faint but visible masks."
0,Timberline Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Thryorchilus browni,https://ebird.org/species/timwre1,"Very small, short-tailed wren.

0,Tinkling Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola rufilatus,https://ebird.org/species/grycis1,"Medium-sized, streak-backed, long-tailed cisticola of uplands. Note the rufous cap and pale stripe above the eye. Found in miombo, other types of woodland, and savanna. Inconspicuous, and usually seen singly or in pairs. Song is a series of very high-pitched notes. Calls include quick trills and ascending slurs. Similar to Rattling Cisticola, but smaller, longer-tailed, and brighter rufous on the head, with a more prominent stripe above the eye. As with all cisticolas, habitat and voice are important cues in identification."
0,Tiny Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola nana,https://ebird.org/species/tincis3,"A plain, miniscule cisticola of dry habitats. The cap and back of the neck are bright rufous, the back and tail are gray-brown, and the underparts are pale buff. The back can appear unstreaked or blurrily streaked. Found in dry thorn savanna and woodland. Within its range and habitat, easily identified by its tiny size and the bright rufous on the head.

Females are generally olive all over with a slight eye-line and darker olive streaking on the undersides. Appears short-billed, and from a distance almost straight-billed. Extremely similar to Olive-bellied Sunbird and Northern Double-collared Sunbird, with which this species co-occurs. Look for Tiny Sunbird’s short, nearly straight bill and the small red breast band on the males. Gives sharp “tsew!” calls and, in its song, multiple notes at different pitches in rapid succession."
0,Tit Berrypecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paramythiidae,Oreocharis arfaki,https://ebird.org/species/titber1,"A small bird of montane forest canopy. Olive upperparts with 2 rows of yellow spots down the back of the wing. Male is strangely titlike, with a yellow belly, black cap, bib and a large yellow cheek patch bordered with black.

From below, note clean white underparts, long tail, and rather heavy bill. Moves sluggishly along branches and examines leaf clusters. Often occurs in the same flocks as Spot-tailed Antwren and is not safely separable from that species under most viewing conditions, except by voice. Song is distinctive and given throughout the day, often when other species are quiet."
0,Todd's Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Setopagis heterura,https://ebird.org/species/samnig1,"Small nightjar of open forests and forest edges, particularly in hilly terrain. Very similar to closely related Little Nightjar, but ranges do not overlap. Readily distinguished from other nightjars in the area by small size and short tail (barely longer than wingtips). Female slightly duller than male, lacking bright white wing patches and replacing male’s white throat and wing spots with buffy off-white. Like other nightjars, difficult to see during the day; typically encountered at night, as it hawks for prey from the ground or a low perch. Listen for its unearthly song: an odd, burbling series of notes that sound like a spacecraft’s controls: “wi’br beerbeerbeer.”"
0,Todd's Sirystes,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Sirystes subcanescens,https://ebird.org/species/todsir1,"Medium-sized, gray-and-white flycatcher of rainforest canopy. Note clean white underparts, contrasting dark head, and (usually) ruffled crown feathers. A rather uncommon resident of tall rainforest; usually found in pairs or small groups, which can be quite noisy and often perch on exposed bare branches. Feeds mainly on insects gleaned in short flights to foliage. May follow mixed-species flocks but often observed away from them. Most easily detected by its varied, strident calls, which include a long, mournful whistle reminiscent of Dusky-capped Flycatcher, and a rapid series of short whistles, the final one lower-pitched and longer. Distinguished from Dusky-capped Flycatcher by white underparts and more varied, excited-sounding vocalizations."
0,Tody Motmot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Momotidae,Hylomanes momotula,https://ebird.org/species/todmot1,"Small and infrequently seen bird of shady forest understory in humid tropical lowlands. Rather inactive. Sits quietly, mainly at low to middle levels, and occasionally wags its tail slowly. Usually not seen until flushed, when flies off with a low whirr of wings.

0,Togian Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox burhani,https://ebird.org/species/toghao1,"A medium-sized brown owl with piercing yellow eyes, confined to the Togian Islands. Cryptically patterned, with a mottled breast, an unmarked pale lower belly, indistinct white eyebrows, and widely scattered white markings on wings. Pairs inhabit forests of lowlands and hills, also occurring in slightly modified habitats. Migrant Northern Boobook visits these islands too; Togian Boobook differs in its finer markings below, pale belly, widespread white markings on wings, and understated white eyebrows. Frog-like vocalizations are unlike those of any owl in region: a grating, but explosive “grrrrr-wow-waow.”"
0,Togo Paradise-Whydah,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Vidua togoensis,https://ebird.org/species/topwhy1,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Yellow-winged Pytilias. As with other whydahs, breeding males are spectacular and bizarre, whereas non-breeding males and females are drab and inconspicuous. Breeding males are mostly black with a rufous breast, a yellow back of the neck, and a long, narrow tail. Non-breeding male and female plumages are poorly known, but show a streaky brownish back and pale underparts. Generally scarce and local in savanna and cultivated areas. Breeding male similar to other paradise-whydahs, but has a longer and narrower tail. Separation of non-breeding male and female from other paradise-whydahs is poorly understood.

0,Toro Olive-Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Phyllastrephus hypochloris,https://ebird.org/species/toogre1,"A drab, long-tailed brownish greenbul. The upperparts are brown and the underparts paler olive-gray. Also note the long bill, brown eye, and slightly paler throat. Found in forest at low and middle elevations, preferring the understory and middle levels of the forest. Separation from other greenbuls is tricky. Very similar to Cabanis’s Greenbul, but lacks pale eye-ring and has darker underparts. More robust and longer-billed than other similarly dull greenbuls, such as Little Greenbul, with a slightly more contrastingly pale throat. The inconspicuous song is a series of low-pitched whistles, often followed by a descending series of several rasping calls. Also gives a series of scolding calls on an even pitch."
0,Torotoroka Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus madagascariensis,https://ebird.org/species/torsco1,"Typical scops-owl, with small ear tufts that can be hidden, especially when roosting during the day. Color varies from gray to brown, and occasionally to rufous. Inhabits dry forest, including spiny forest, scrub, and plantations. Often found on day roosts in low tree holes or tangles. Song is a rolling “trrr-trrr-trrr…”. Very similar to Malagasy Scops-Owl, but found in dry forest rather than rainforest, and its song consists of notes that are rolled together rather than distinct hooting notes."
0,Torrent Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Merganetta armata,https://ebird.org/species/torduc1,"An amazing duck of fast-flowing Andean rivers and streams. Usually seen as singles or pairs resting on rocks in rushing water and not associating with other ducks.

Slaty-blue overall with a white belly and white underwings. Extremely long bill. In breeding plumage, look for buffy plumes on the lower back and orange tones on the throat and foreneck. Juveniles are stained rusty on the neck and shoulders. Fairly common but with restricted range in the southeastern U.S., mainly along the coast. More widespread in Central America and northern South America. Occurs in shallow wetlands, marshes, and mudflats. Often forages actively, darting around erratically and chasing after fish."
0,Tricolored Parrotfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Erythrura tricolor,https://ebird.org/species/tripar1,"A small blue finch with conspicuous red tail and an emerald-green back. Females duller, with green extending to nape. Juveniles dull green, with gray head and pale bill, but still show red tail. Singles, pairs, or flocks feed on or near the ground in forests, open woodlands, and thickets within the lowlands and mountains. An undescribed parrotfinch has been documented on Mount Mutis in Timor; Tricolored differs from it in lacking red on the face. Calls include soft, high-pitched “seet” and “sit” notes."
0,Trilling Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola woosnami,https://ebird.org/species/tricis1,"Fairly large, plain cisticola. Note the rufous cap, pale underparts, and two bands across the tip of the tail, one pale and one black. Found in a variety of savanna habitats, including miombo. The distinctive song is a high, rising trill, given from a prominent perch. The call is an agitated, repeated “chit.” As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Fairly similar to Whistling Cisticola, but has a rufous cap."
0,Trilling Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus parvirostris,https://ebird.org/species/tritap1,"Tiny, compact gray bird. Females are slightly duller, with brown lower sides and rump. Like most tapaculos, they are usually very shy and rarely seen in the open.

No other bird in the country shares its beautiful orange, green, and blue color pattern, and the black mask, breast spot, ruby eye, and large size make it truly unforgettable. Inhabits rainforest where it stays fairly low and usually well hidden, but occasionally may venture out into more open areas if there are large trees to perch in. Often gives a low-pitched “boo” or “boo-dip”, and sometimes a longer series when excited."
0,Trinidad Piping-Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pipile pipile,https://ebird.org/species/trpgua1,"Large, turkey-like bird found only in the forests of northern Trinidad. It is black with white patches on the wings and crown, a light blue face, and an azure dewlap (flap of bare skin) that dangles from its throat. It is usually seen high in the trees, but on rare occasions can descend to the ground. Song is a series of drawn out, rising whistles, and it also sometimes rattles its wings loudly in flight. Locally known as “pawi”, this impressive bird is highly endangered due to hunting, and is regularly seen in only a few places, such as near the town of Grand Riviere."
0,Tristan Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus eremita,https://ebird.org/species/trithr1,"A robust, variably plumaged dark thrush with orange and buff markings and blotchy brown streaks. Juvenile has buff fringes to its feathers. The only medium-sized songbird within its range. Singles and pairs are fairly common endemic residents on islands within the Tristan group in the south Atlantic, but rare on Tristan da Cunha itself due to introduced rats. A generalist predator and scavenger occupying heath, tussock grassland, and shorelines. Gives a short high-pitched chipping “ttslit” and a simple wheezy song."
0,Tristram's Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza tristrami,https://ebird.org/species/tribun1,"Small and distinctive bunting, usually seen moving around quietly in thick undergrowth.

0,Tropical Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus cinereus,https://ebird.org/species/tropew1,"Small ‘generic’ flycatcher of forest edge and open woodland in tropical lowlands. Behavior is much like that of the wood-pewees in North America: usually perches on a fairly prominent and conspicuous twig or branch and sallies out for insects, returning to the same perch, often calling as it lands, and sometimes ‘shivering’ its tail. Does not flick its wings and tail like flycatchers in the genus Empidonax. Eastern and Western Wood-Pewees occur as spring and fall migrants in the range of Tropical, but have longer wings that extend farther down the tail on a perched bird, and different calls."
0,Tropical Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops choliba,https://ebird.org/species/trsowl,"As with all screech-owls, much easier to identify by voice: a short rapid trill with a pop at the end. If you’re lucky enough to see one, look for an overall grayish-brown or rufous bird with fine markings, including thin streaks on underparts. Black border to face. Sexes alike. Found in wooded habitats, sometimes coming out into open shrubby fields or gardens with only a few scattered trees. Usually the most common screech-owl in range."

It can be surprisingly inconspicuous while eating large fruit in forest trees, but in flight it has noisy wingbeats and a far-carrying baby-like wailing “whaaaaaa waa waa” call. In flight note narrow white hind edges to the mostly dark wings; the similar Black-and-white-casqued Hornbill has a very broad white hind edge, and the Silvery-cheeked Hornbill has no white hind edge."
0,Trumpeter Swan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Cygnus buccinator,https://ebird.org/species/truswa,"Huge white bird with long neck and all-black bill. Immatures dusky gray-brown with pink on bill. Forages in shallow, vegetated wetlands reaching under the water for plants, and walks through corn stubble. Breeds in freshwater marshes and ponds. Winters on any open body of water where food is available. Extremely similar to Tundra Swan, but never shows yellow on bill. Also, note subtle features of face: facial skin is relatively broad where it meets eye, so the eye doesn't stand out, and border between white face and black bill is straight (curved on Tundra). From head-on, the border of the bill and forehead is usually pointed (straight or curved on Tundra). Often in pairs or family groups.

0,Tufted Coquette,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Lophornis ornatus,https://ebird.org/species/tufcoq1,"Tiny, ornately patterned hummingbird with a bold pale rump band. Exquisite adult male plumage features a bushy orange crest and long orange plumes tipped dark green, sweeping back from the cheeks over the shoulders, and set off by a white rump band and stout orange bill tipped black. Female lacks such adornment and is greenish above and whitish below, with a contrasting tawny throat, buffy rump band, and duller bill. Occurs in a wide range of humid forest types from lowland rainforest to premontane forest in the tepui region. Feeds on nectar and is most likely to be seen at flowering trees, where it forages unobtrusively, sneaking nectar from the territories of other hummingbirds. More common and widespread than other coquettes in range. Female Tufted is best told by tawny throat and overall plain appearance."
0,Tufted Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya fuligula,https://ebird.org/species/tufduc,"Common in wetlands from marshy and reed-fringed lakes to open reservoirs; locally on the sea in winter, especially when lakes freeze. Boldly patterned male distinctive: black overall with bright white flanks (whiter than scaup) and floppy crest. Female dark brown overall with short crest, paler flanks, staring golden-yellow eyes, and often a messy white patch at base of bill. In flight, both sexes show bold white wingstripe. Often in flocks in winter; feeds mainly by diving, but often spends much of day sleeping. Widespread breeder across Eurasia, wintering to central Africa, India, and Southeast Asia. Rare winter vagrant to North America, where almost always found singly among flocks of scaup. Compared with scaup, Tufted Duck always shows very dark blackish back, and even nearly tuftless females are darker than scaup with more limited white patch on face."

Greenish gray, with dull reddish wings that have weak reddish wing bars. Many individuals have a complete pale whitish eye-ring. Perches upright in the midstory of montane forest, where pairs and individuals may join mixed-species flocks. Compared to the similar Flavescent Flycatcher which overlaps with it in places, Unadorned has a more obvious circular eye-ring (as opposed to more of a black eye-line with a broken eye-ring in Flavescent) and is grayer overall; it is also typically found at lower elevations."
0,Undulated Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria squamigera,https://ebird.org/species/undant1,"Large antpitta of the temperate zone in the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia. Typical antpitta shape: plump with short tail and long legs. Size alone helps separate from most other antpittas, as does boldly scalloped underparts. Often occurs at higher elevations than other antpittas of similar size such as Giant and Great, but plenty of overlap; note Undulated’s slaty gray (not brown) back and dark mustache stripe. Like most antpittas, very difficult to see; occasionally hops along a forest trail, especially in the morning and evening. Listen for its fast, hollow-sounding triling song."

Found over a variety of habitats, often in flocks with other swiftlets. Almost always seen in flight. Widespread, so overlaps with multiple similar swiftlets. Uniform Swiftlet is larger and longer-winged than Glossy, Cave, and Bornean Swiftlets, with a dark belly and a non-fluttering flight action. Uniform Swiftlet lacks the clear pale rump of White-rumped, Seram, Halmahera, Sulawesi, and some Glossy Swiftlets, and is larger than those species. Uniform lacks gloss on upperparts, unlike Mayr’s, Mountain, and Glossy Swiftlets. It is smaller than Bare-legged, Mayr’s, Papuan, Volcano, and Giant Swiftlets. It is most similar to Edible-nest and Black-nest Swiftlets, but Uniform is darker beneath, and lacks the slightly paler rump of Edible-nest; it is best distinguished from those species by its mossy nest."
0,Uniform Treehunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Thripadectes ignobilis,https://ebird.org/species/unitre1,"Medium-sized brownish bird of the lower subtropical zone in the western Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. Plain dark brown with much less streaking than other treehunters; only shows a slightly paler eyebrow and some streaking on the throat. Typically found at lower elevations than other treehunters in range, but some overlap. Western Woodhaunter is found at similar elevations but has a longer, narrower bill and a paler buffy throat. Singles or pairs follow mixed-species flocks through the understory, where they can be skulky and difficult to see. Listen for the song: a slow series of 5-10 squeaky notes."
0,Uniform Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Hylexetastes uniformis,https://ebird.org/species/uniwoo1,"Large, stout-billed woodcreeper of tall rainforest in southeastern Amazonia. Plumage entirely rufous-brown with no barring or streaking; note thick dusky-reddish bill, plain face, and brownish throat (not contrastingly white). Found in tall rainforest as well as slightly lower-stature forests on sandy soils; generally less common than other large woodcreepers. Climbs along tree trunks and large branches at middle and upper levels, probing bark crevices for insects and small vertebrates; occasionally follows army ant swarms to capture animals fleeing up tree trunks. Heard more often than seen. Song, given mainly at dawn, is a far-carrying, hoarse whistle repeated 3–4 times, very unlike other woodcreepers. Amazonian Barred-Woodcreeper, which also has a reddish bill, may occur with Uniform at ant swarms and be mistaken for it in dim understory light; note Uniform’s stouter bill and plainer plumage."
0,Upcher's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Hippolais languida,https://ebird.org/species/upcwar1,"A medium-sized, gray-brown warbler that looks very similar to other species. Note the rather stout bill and broad dark tail. Smaller and browner than Olive-Tree Warbler and larger than Eastern Olivaceous Warbler. Wing panel not as prominent as in Olive-Tree Warbler. Breeds on scrubby hillsides. During migration found in a variety of habitats. Sings from prominent perches—a repetitive, rapid mix of musical and scratchy phrases. Call is a harsh ""Chak."""
0,Upland Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus aroyae,https://ebird.org/species/uplant1,"Small antshrike found in the Andes of Bolivia and adjacent areas of Peru near the border. Male is gray with white wingbars and pale eyes; female is brown with a gray face. Male is a bit similar to Variable Antshrike, but he is gray, not glossy black. Skulks in dense thickets at forest edge, where it is usually heard before being seen. Gives nasal caws, either alone or in a short series."
0,Upland Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo hemilasius,https://ebird.org/species/uplbuz1,"A large raptor of expansive open spaces such as steppe, pastures, and semi-deserts. Perches visibly on utility poles and snags. Especially abundant near marmot and pika colonies. Longer-winged and more heavily marked than smaller Eastern and Himalayan Buzzards, but identification can be challenging. Plumages include both light and dark morphs; both have a large dark patch on the underwing at the “wrist.” Dark morph is black with pale outer underwings (“hands”), and light morph is blotchy brown below, with dark tarsal feathers (“trousers”) reminiscent of Rough-legged Hawk."
0,Upland Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Chloephaga picta,https://ebird.org/species/uplgoo1,"Common and conspicuous in most of its range, becoming uncommon and local in northern areas. Pairs and flocks are common along roadsides in Patagonian steppe grasslands, wetlands, at lakes, and along coasts. The male is strikingly white necked; some males have clean white breast and belly, others have dark-barred body. The female is brownish overall and much less noticeable with a rusty brown to grayish brown head and neck (compare to the rare Ruddy-headed Goose). Both sexes have bold black-and-white wing pattern that is striking in flight."
0,Upland Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus sylvanus,https://ebird.org/species/uplpip1,"This large pipit has an expansive range, but is uncommon and sparsely distributed throughout most of it. Breeds in foothills and mountains, but descends during the winter. Large-billed and rather thickset, with an upright stance, fine dark streaks throughout with paler underparts. Also note paler brow. May be confused with Richard’s and Blyth’s Pipits, but it is more densely streaked and with a stouter and shorter bill."
0,Upland Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Bartramia longicauda,https://ebird.org/species/uplsan,"Distinctive sandpiper found in areas with short grass. Frequently seen perched on fence posts or atop small shrubs. Overall patterned buffy-brown with small head, long neck, large eye, and yellow bill with black tip. Long tail and shallow fluttery wingbeats give it a unique look in flight. Song typically given in flight; starts with a soft gurgling trill and ends with a loud whistle that rises and falls. Migrates to South America in the winter, particularly Paraguay and northern Argentina."
0,Ural Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix uralensis,https://ebird.org/species/uraowl1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common in colder regions, where favors coniferous and mixed forest, often with nearby clearings and bogs. Active at night, when often hunts at forest edge and around clearings. Very large and rather plain owl with small dark eyes, no ear tufts; lacks any obvious field marks, and often looks somewhat pallid and grayish. Large and longer-tailed than Tawny Owl, which occurs mainly in milder and more southern habitats; also Great Gray Owl."
0,Urich's Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phyllomyias urichi,https://ebird.org/species/urityr1,"Poorly known, this small, yellow-green flycatcher is short-billed and long-tailed, with a pinkish lower mandible, whitish lores, and yellowish wingbars. Olive green above and yellow below. Sexes similar. Rare and nearly unknown in life; no certainty about the habitat, but presumably in forested areas. Vocalizations unknown. Similar to Sooty-headed Tyrannulet which has a black bill, lacks wingbars, and has a contrasting grayish head. Endemic to the Turimiquire region of northeastern Venezuela."
0,Urrao Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria urraoensis,https://ebird.org/species/antant1,"This antpitta has a very small range in the northern part of Colombia’s western Andes. It was described to science in 2010 and is considered highly endangered. Upperparts and hood are dull chestnut brown, and it has a gray breast and belly. Similar to Chestnut-naped Antpitta, but in Urrao the crown is much duller and throat is chestnut (not gray). Inhabits bamboo-laden understory of high elevation cloud forest, and usually very hard to see, though it sometimes visits a feeder within the Dusky Starfrontlet Nature Reserve. Song is three curt whistles; there is a pause after the first note, and the last note is higher."
0,Ursula's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris ursulae,https://ebird.org/species/urssun2,"A small, inconspicuous, and easily overlooked sunbird of mountain forests. At a distance, appears fairly uniform in color, but in good light the greenish back contrasts with the gray face, olive throat, pale belly, and reddish tufts on the sides of the body that are sometimes concealed by the wings. Bill is not overly long, but is distinctly curved. Within its range, most likely to be confused with Little Green Sunbird, but Ursula’s Sunbird has a plain face and more decurved, all black bill. Song varies, but always consists of sharp, high-pitched notes that are sometimes delivered as a jumble and sometimes as a single note followed by a descending pattern of quick, high pitched notes: “tsee-TSEE-TSI-tsi-tsi.”"
0,Usambara Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia montana,https://ebird.org/species/usaaka1,"A rather small, demure understory denizen resembling a cross between a robin and a flycatcher. Mostly dull brownish-olive with a rusty rump and tail, a paler throat, and a distinctive pale patch between the eye and bill. In display, may reveal a rufous spot near the eye. Juvenile is more mottled. A local and endangered bird found singly and in pairs in thick undergrowth of primary and secondary montane forest in a narrow range along the West Usambara mountains between 1600 and 2300 meters of elevation. Sits for long periods, sallying to catch insect prey, or forages on the ground, often in the company of ants and other ant-following birds. Sings a medley of up-and-down high-pitched whistles that is sweet without being tuneful. Alarm call is a grating “drrrzzt, drrrt, drrrt.” May be mistaken for a flycatcher, but its furtive nature and preference for thick understory are unique within its range."
0,Usambara Hyliota,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hyliotidae,Hyliota usambara,https://ebird.org/species/usahyl1,"A medium-sized, generic-looking warbler-like bird of Tanzania’s Usambara Mountains with a blue-black back, a white wing patch, and a pale breast suffused with a yellow-orange tinge. Found very locally in humid foothill forest, where it forages in the canopy and sometimes joins mixed flocks with other birds. Easily recognized as the only hyliota within its tiny range. Can appear warbler-like, but separated from all warblers by the white wing patch. The vocalizations are not well known and seem to be easy to overlook, but do include quiet “pit” notes."
0,Usambara Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus roehli,https://ebird.org/species/usathr1,"A typical thrush with brownish upperparts and paler rufous-and-gray underparts. Also note the darker face, yellow bill, and striped throat. Found in the understory of montane forest and along forest edges. Occasionally bold, but typically quite shy, with only calls betraying its presence in the undergrowth. Abyssinian Thrush is similar, but does not overlap in range. Usambara Thrush gives a typical melodic thrush song, and calls include a ""chk-chk"" and thin ""tseeep"" notes."
0,Usambara Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus nicolli,https://ebird.org/species/usawea1,"An unusual weaver with dark upperparts, an orange bib, and a yellow belly. The male shows a yellowish forehead patch that the female lacks. Found very locally in the upper levels of montane forest, usually in pairs that often join mixed-species flocks. Creeps along branches like a nuthatch. Somewhat similar to Forest Weaver, but easily separated by the orange breast. Vocalizations include a “seet-swit” call that is unusual for a weaver and a “radio static” song with a distinctively rollicking rhythm."
0,Ussher's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Bradornis ussheri,https://ebird.org/species/ussfly1,"An unusual small, chunky flycatcher. At a distance, looks entirely dark, but a good view reveals a slightly paler throat and a dark undertail with paler fringes. Has long, pointed wings and looks a bit like a swallow in flight. Found in rainforest and gallery forest, where it perches up on dead trees, especially at the forest edge and around clearings. Often in small groups. Similar to Sooty Flycatcher, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Ussher’s is separated by its darker underparts. Easily separated from other flycatchers by very dark plumage and unusual habits. Not very vocal, but does give a quiet, squeaky song."

0,Vampire Ground-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Geospiza septentrionalis,https://ebird.org/species/shbgrf1,"A rarely-seen Galápagos finch restricted to the islands of Darwin and Wolf. These islands are usually visited only by divers, so few birders have a chance to see this species. It was formerly considered a subspecies of Sharp-beaked Ground-Finch, and it has a similarly-shaped sharp, thin with nearly straight edges. Bill is black on breeding male and dull orange on female and nonbreeding male. Male’s plumage is sooty-black; female is brown with paler underparts that are streaked with gray. Its ominous name comes from its occasional habit of drinking blood, which it extracts from other animals by pecking until the skin is broken."
0,Van Dam's Vanga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Xenopirostris damii,https://ebird.org/species/vadvan1,"Large, big-billed vanga with white underparts. Males have a black hood, and females only a black cap. Rare Madagascar endemic that is found very locally in dry deciduous forest in the north and northwest. Can be found solo or in pairs, sometimes in flocks with other vangas. Most common vocalizations are long, penetrating whistles and a short scold. Separated from Lafresnaye’s and Pollen’s Vangas by range. Separated from Madagascar Cuckooshrike by much larger bill and white rather than gray underparts."
0,Van Hasselt's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Leptocoma brasiliana,https://ebird.org/species/vahsun1,"Attractive medium-sized sunbird of lowland forests, from coastal scrub forests to inland evergreen forests. Male is black with an iridescent pink-red throat, a red belly, and a glistening blue-green crown. Female is extensively yellowish with a pale vent and a thin dark line through the eye. Purple-throated Sunbird is essentially identical, but ranges do not overlap. Female Plain-throated Sunbird can be similar, but is straighter-billed, with a darker head, and a faint pale ring around the eye. Song, often given from an exposed perch, consists of squeaky rising whistles and chip notes."
0,Vanikoro Monarch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Mayrornis schistaceus,https://ebird.org/species/vanmon1,"A rather chunky flycatcher, mostly dark slate-gray with a pale eye-ring and obvious white undertail. Sometimes cocks and slightly fans tail, especially if aggravated. Dependent on primary forest. Apparently tolerant of old logged areas, but easily disturbed. Voice is a typical scolding “tchatchatcha.”"
0,Vanuatu Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Todiramphus farquhari,https://ebird.org/species/chbkin1,"A beautiful, boldly contrasting kingfisher with a blue head, a big black eye-mask, a white throat and neck, vibrant blue upperparts, and bright ginger underparts. Prefers undisturbed lowland forest. Often shy, sitting motionless in the canopy. Bright orange underparts separate it from other local kingfishers. Very vocal, giving a long series of chirping notes rising in pitch and speed."
0,Vanuatu Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma occulta,https://ebird.org/species/venpet1,"Rare and difficult to identify, this petrel is known to breed solely on the steep vegetated slopes of Vanua Lava, in northern Vanuatu. Most frequently reported in the seas surrounding Vanuatu, it likely ranges much further afield in the southwest Pacific; unfortunately, its similarity to other petrel species and the sparse coverage of that region make determining this difficult. Note neat black cap, bright white hindcollar, and black “M” across the uppersides of the wings. Extremely similar to White-necked Petrel; Vanuatu averages slightly smaller and smaller-billed overall, and with minimal amounts of white on the undersides of the primaries compared to White-necked. However, some Vanuatus can show significant white “tongues” in the primary undersides, and as such, identification remains extremely difficult away from the species’ core range in northern Vanuatu. Juan Fernandez Petrel can also be very similar, but lacks the bright white hindcollar and has even more extensive white tongues on the primary undersides. Typically solitary at sea, but can congregate in feeding flocks, sometimes with other species."
0,Variable Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/varant1,"Small antshrike with extensive plumage variation among subspecies for both sexes.

0,Variable Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus pyrrhopterus,https://ebird.org/species/epaori4,"Slender oriole with a long tail and straight bill. Entirely black apart from the shoulders, which can be chestnut or yellow and the thighs, which can be yellow or black depending on the subspecies. Found at the edge of humid forests, in wooded savannas, and in urban parks and gardens. Builds a globe-shaped nest. In the nonbreeding season may accompany mixed-species flocks. The song is fast and variable including songs and calls of other birds."
0,Variable Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/varoys1,"A large, stocky shorebird endemic to New Zealand. Adults vary in color from all black to pied, with a range of intermediate morphs in between. Juveniles have a dark-tipped bill, browner plumage, and gray legs. A coastal bird, breeding on sandy beaches, sand spits, rocky coasts, and occasionally the shores of coastal lakes. Will forage in paddocks. Gives a loud piping alarm call. Pied-morph birds appear similar to South Island Pied Oystercatcher (SIPO) and Chatham Oystercatcher. Adult pied-morph Variable Oystercatchers are visibly larger, with smudgy border between pied plumage on breast. Also note less white showing forward of folded wing around “shoulder.”"
0,Variable Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sporophila corvina,https://ebird.org/species/varsee3,"Small seed-eating bird of humid tropical lowlands; fairly common. Found in grassy and weedy areas and forest edges, often in same places as slightly larger Thick-billed Seed-Finch. In pairs or small flocks, mixing readily with Morelet's Seedeaters and other seed-eating birds. Note stubby bill (unlike Thick-billed Seed-Finch) and plain brownish olive plumage of female (not rich brown like seed-finch). Males in Mexico and most of Central America are black. In southern Central America and South America males have variable amounts of white on the underparts and rump, hence the name."
0,Variable Shrikethrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Colluricincla fortis,https://ebird.org/species/litshr5,"A chunky bird with a thick bill. Quite plain: brownish on the back, grayish on the head, and paler below, with indistinct breast streaking. Color of the underparts varies geographically from dull rufous to whitish-buff. Found at low and middle elevations in humid forest, including secondary forest. Rich, melodious, variable song consists of several penetrating whistles, generally in an up-and-down pattern. Calls include “chek” notes. Somewhat similar to Rusty Pitohui, but smaller, with a dark rather than pale eye. Also similar to Gray Shrikethrush, but smaller, shorter-tailed, and browner, with a darker face. Could be confused with female Black Shrikethrush, but always smaller and paler."
0,Variable Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris venustus,https://ebird.org/species/varsun2,"Medium-sized sunbird with strikingly different breeding male and female plumages. Breeding males are green on the head and back, with a purple band across the breast.

Females and non-breeding males are plain olive-brown on the back and dull yellow below. Found in a broad range of habitats, from arid thornscrub to moist savanna, gardens, and forest edge. Vocalizations typical of a sunbird, and include a quick jumbled song. Similar to Collared Sunbird, but larger, with a longer and more curved bill."
0,Variable Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe picata,https://ebird.org/species/varwhe1,"Well-named; black-and-white pattern of the males is striking but varies considerably. Brownish female is not as noticeably variable, but also can be considerably darker or lighter-colored. Note black-and-white tail in all plumages. Inhabits arid and barren foothills, plateaus, valleys, and mountains, where it forages from a perch and on the ground."
0,Varied Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Passerina versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/varbun,"Seemingly dark and dull at a distance, males sport a spectacular color pattern when seen up close. Note red nape and throat, brilliant blue forehead, purplish cheek, and red arcs behind the eyes. Body is rich purple set off by a blue rump. Female is exceptionally plain. She is a warm, medium-brown with very few markings, distinguished from other female buntings by plainer wings and belly and curved top of the bill. Prefers brushy habitats often with steep slopes, especially riparian areas and desert washes. Generally uncommon. Listening for their song, a low, rough warble, is often the best way to find them."

Yellow eyering in all plumages, but different subspecies vary tremendously in plumage, ranging from black-headed to white-headed, streaked and unstreaked; in flight all, show prominent pale wingstripe. Inhabits woodlands, where usually seen in small flocks that methodically clamber along tree trunks, probing for insects in bark. Birds give frequent “chip-chip” call as they forage."
0,Varied Solitaire,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Myadestes coloratus,https://ebird.org/species/varsol1,"Medium-sized thrush with extremely limited range at the border of Panama and Colombia. Unlikely to be mistaken—gray head and underparts with black face and brown back are unique. Also note its orange bill and legs. Sexes similar. Found in cloud forest from around 900–1,500 m, where it is most likely to be seen around a fruiting tree. More often heard than seen; listen for its flutelike song with ringing notes given at different pitches."
0,Varied Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Ixoreus naevius,https://ebird.org/species/varthr,"A beautiful, boldly-patterned thrush.

Migratory population breeds extensively in the western U.S. and Canada, wintering to Central America. Resident “Richmond’s Swift” occurs through much of Mexico and Central America, and is darker overall than migratory Vaux’s with a more contrasting pale throat and browner rump. There are also resident populations on the Yucatan peninsula and in western Venezuela, for which identification criteria are not well-defined. Range overlaps with several other similar swifts in Mexico and Central America. Vaux’s is smaller with quicker wingbeats than Chimney Swift or Gray-rumped Swift, with higher-pitched calls."

Spectacular male is unmistakable, all brilliant scarlet except for the blackish wings, tail, and belly. Female is dull gray-brown except for a diagnostic red wash on the head. Prefers forests and forest edge in foothills and mountains, where encountered singly or in pairs, sometimes with mixed-species feeding flocks. Calls on Buru include a disyllabic, slurring “tsiwit” as well as a “tsisewoo” song with trembling quality at the end. Voice of Seram birds differs, possibly indicating that they are a different species: “twee’ti’dit’tee.”"
0,Wallacean Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina personata,https://ebird.org/species/walcus1,"A large, heavy-billed songbird. Highly variable. In the Kai islands and western Lesser Sundas, plumage is uniform blackish-gray; on Sumba, birds are pale gray above with an all-black tail, black face, and white belly; and in the eastern lesser Sundas, darker slaty-gray above with a black face mask. Singles and pairs frequent many habitats including forest, edge, woodland, and savanna, from lowlands into mountains. Large size and very heavy bill of all forms distinguishes them from all cicadabirds. On Sumba, entirely black tail, lacking white, rules out Black-faced Cuckooshrike. In other areas, Wallacean is separated from Black-faced by the absence of a clean white belly, the darker upperparts, and the less distinct black face.

0,Wandering Albatross,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea exulans,https://ebird.org/species/wanalb,"Huge albatross of the Southern Ocean; breeds locally on remote islands, but circles the globe on its travels. Plumage highly variable, but always has white underwings with small black tip. Only similar species that is equally large is Royal Albatross, which never has dirty brownish markings on head and body or a mostly black tail as seen on many Wandering Albatrosses. Juvenile Wandering starts out with a chocolate brown head and body and a white face patch; gradually attains adult plumage over many years. Oldest Wandering develops extensively white upperwings and a white tail, much like Royal, making older birds difficult to separate. Wandering lacks narrow black “lips” on bill of Royal, often has messier, more spotted pattern on upperwing, and can show diagnostic pinkish stain on cheeks, not shown by Royal."
0,Wandering Tattler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa incana,https://ebird.org/species/wantat1,"Medium-sized, gray shorebird with short yellow legs and straight bill. Elongated, horizontal posture. In breeding plumage, look for jaggedly barred underparts and thin white eyebrow; similar in winter but with plainer gray underparts. Usually found on rocks, where it typically forages independently while bobbing its tail up and down. Sometimes close to other rock-loving shorebirds like turnstones, Surfbird, and Rock Sandpiper. Compare with extremely similar Gray-tailed Tattler, which overlaps extensively in range in western Alaska, the South Pacific, Australia, and parts of Asia. Wandering is more closely associated with rocky habitats as opposed to beaches and mudflats, but this shouldn’t be used as a definitive field mark. Plumage differences are very subtle. In breeding plumage, Wandering averages coarser and more extensive barring on underparts, and juveniles usually have darker gray flanks. All ages have a longer groove on the upper mandible. Best characteristic is voice: Wandering typically gives a ringing trilled call, much different than Gray-tailed’s two- or three-noted “too-wee” call."
0,Wandering Whistling-Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Dendrocygna arcuata,https://ebird.org/species/wawduc1,"Medium-sized dark whistling-duck with cream-colored flank plumes.

A rare resident in the hilly Daalo and Mash Caleed regions of northern Somalia, where it prefers degraded juniper forest and other woodland and scrub between 1200 and 2400 meters of elevation. Forages on the ground in pairs or small groups, and perches on exposed branches and dead trees. Sings a typical canary-like song with whistles, trills, and buzzes. Calls include a high-pitched “tsee-wit.” Streaky juvenile could be confused with a canary, but white in the wing is distinctive."
0,Water Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus spinoletta,https://ebird.org/species/watpip1,"Fairly common but often local, especially in winter. Breeds in mountains on barren, often rocky ground; winters in varied wetland habitats, from lakeshores to salt marshes. Breeding plumage grayish above with white eyebrow; breast pale pinkish, mostly unstreaked. Nonbreeding plumage grayish brown above, whitish below with dark streaks. Sides of tail clean white, versus dingy whitish on Rock Pipit, which can occur in same coastal areas in winter. Call a high, lisping, slightly upslurred ""ssiip"", very similar to Rock Pipit call."
0,Water Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus aquaticus,https://ebird.org/species/watrai1,"Shy but generally not uncommon, this reclusive marsh bird is more often heard than seen; listen for its varied piglike squeals and grunts coming from dense vegetation. Favors fresh marshes and ponds with taller vegetation, especially reeds and rushes; in winter and freezing weather, sometimes in tidal marshes. Most often seen at muddy edges, walking stealthily; can move very quickly. About half the size of a moorhen. Note long, mostly red bill (unlike short, chickenlike bill of crakes), and barred flanks. Replaced in much of Asia by the Brown-cheeked Rail, with which it has minor overlap; very similar, but lacks the strong eye stripe of that species, has a darker throat and grayer breast and belly."
0,Watercock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallicrex cinerea,https://ebird.org/species/waterc1,"Large, distinctive marsh dweller, elusive and often difficult to see in the heavily vegetated wet fields and marshes it inhabits. Male is unmistakable, with black body, brown-edged wing coverts, and red-and-yellow bill with raised, spiky red frontal shield (unlike smaller moorhen). Females and immature are similarly large but speckled brown above with tan faces, and lack male’s frontal shield. Males are very vocal when breeding, producing liquid-sounding gulps comparable to a water bottle emptying. Both sexes make a range of incisive, guttural clucking and creaking calls, as well as a sharp “keek” in alarm."
0,Watkins's Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria watkinsi,https://ebird.org/species/watant1,"Medium-sized antpitta with limited range in dry woodlands in southwest Ecuador and northwest Peru. Fairly common and unmistakable within range and habitat. Typical antpitta shape: plump and short-tailed with long legs, like a grapefruit on stilts. Brown above with bold streaking on underparts, messy-looking face, and a tawny crown. Looks like a washed-out version of Chestnut-crowned Antpitta, which occurs at higher elevations (and typically in wetter forests). Voice is distinctive: a descending series of rich whistles ending with a longer rising note. Usually secretive, but can be detected as it noisily hops through dry leaf litter."
0,Wattled Broadbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Eurylaimidae,Sarcophanops steerii,https://ebird.org/species/watbro1,"A medium-sized bird of lowland and foothill forest on Mindanao and neighboring islands, with a pale blue bill and eye wattle, a black face, a streaked crown, a dark back with a white-and-yellow wingbar, a white collar, and a reddish rump and tail. Underparts are white in the female and pinkish in the male. Makes short sallies from a perched position to catch insects. Can be found in pairs, small groups, or sometimes mixed-species flocks.

Bare facial skin is pale-blue in the male and dull gray in the female. Red wattles on the head and chest are reduced in the female. Very shy and difficult to see. Roams the forest floor, scraping leaves to uncover fallen fruit, seeds and invertebrates. Similar to other brushturkeys but Wattled has a vertically-flattened tail with maroon rump and darker legs. Usually quiet but can give a sharp series of “ki! kekekekekeke” with the first note higher."
0,Wattled Crane,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Bugeranus carunculatus,https://ebird.org/species/watcra2,"A large, grayish crane with a gleaming white neck, conspicuous wattles, and red facial skin. The immature is duller and lacks wattles, but it retains the distinctive pale neck of the adult. It requires sedge-dominated wetlands for breeding but will forage on adjacent grasslands and plains, where it digs for tubers, insects, and small vertebrates. The Wattled Crane is resident in larger wetlands, where it breeds in pairs, although flocks of up to 1,000 may gather after breeding. It is locally nomadic in smaller perennial wetlands in alpine grasslands. Although it is mostly silent, it has a distinctive, rapid, screechy “Koorok-kreek” call."
0,Wattled Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax globulosa,https://ebird.org/species/watcur1,"Very large black gamebird with a red bill. Males have a white ventral region which is chestnut in females. Strongly associated with riparian environments, especially seasonally flooded forest and river islands, where it is quite arboreal. Now very rare over much of its range because of overhunting."
0,Wattled Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Aburria aburri,https://ebird.org/species/watgua1,"Distinctive guan: all black with cerulean bill, yellowish-orange legs, and thin yellow dewlap. Could be confused with Sickle-winged Guan, which is smaller and has warm brown underparts. Occurs in the subtropical zone of the Andes from Venezuela to Peru, from around 1,200 to 2,200 m. Surprisingly difficult to see as it forages in the middle to upper levels of dense forest; rarely perches in the open. Most often detected by its amazing voice, a strange alien-like call that rises and falls."
0,Wattled Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Bostrychia carunculata,https://ebird.org/species/watibi1,"A dark ibis with a shaggy crest and a small wattle below the bill that is difficult to see. White patches in the wings are distinctive, especially in flight. Found in montane habitats including grasslands, marshes, moorlands, and even urban lawns. Often in small flocks. Somewhat similar to other dark ibis, but easily separated by the white in the wing. The calls are raspy and rough."
0,Wattled Jacana,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Jacanidae,Jacana jacana,https://ebird.org/species/watjac1,"Striking marsh bird, medium-sized with exceptionally long toes. In some regions adult is entirely black; other populations more similar to Northern Jacana with rufous upperparts. Always has red forehead and wattle at base of bill. Juveniles very similar to Northern Jacana: bronzy-brown above with white underparts and eyebrow; note yellow bill and long toes to separate from other marsh birds. All ages show yellow wings in flight. Found in wetlands, usually with a combination of grasses and lily pads."
0,Wattled Ploughbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Eulacestomatidae,Eulacestoma nigropectus,https://ebird.org/species/watplo1,"A fairly small, plump bird with a unique bill shape of montane forest. Male is yellow-green with black wing, chest, and two large, pink, fleshy wattles beside the bill. The female is olive-green with paler underparts. Forages low and especially likes climbing bamboo. Uses its strong bill to strip wood and dig into branches. Male plumage is unique, but even with the female’s non-descript plumage, the bill shape should be a give-away. Voice, a single, long, high-pitch note."
0,Wattled Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Creatophora cinerea,https://ebird.org/species/watsta1,"A medium-sized gray-brown starling with dark wings and tail and a whitish rump. The pale bill and lemon-yellow facial skin in females and non-breeding males is subdued, but breeding males often acquire long, fleshy, dangling black wattles and canary-yellow naked skin on the head. This nomad always tends to be in groups, and breeds opportunistically in colonies. It occurs irregularly and is irruptive in short grasslands and open savannas; at any given location it may number in the thousands in some years, and be absent in others. It may associate with large mammals, capturing insects that they flush. Both sexes give a variety of squeaks and hissing notes."
0,Waved Albatross,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Phoebastria irrorata,https://ebird.org/species/wavalb,"Large and gangly seabird that nests only in Galápagos and on Isla de la Plata (a small island near Ecuador’s central coast). When not breeding, it disperses over the eastern Pacific Ocean as far south as Chile. The only albatross likely to be seen in and near Galápagos. Adult is brown with a white head and neck and a large, yellow bill. Head and neck have a slight yellow tinge. Young birds are almost all brown and gradually develop the white head.

Distinctive loud song, given year-round, often rendered “I’m a wee-bill!”"
0,Weka,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus australis,https://ebird.org/species/weka1,"Large, flightless rail endemic to New Zealand. Can be very curious, especially when living around people. Extinct over large tracts of the mainland. Variable plumage. Most birds are predominantly light brown with red eyes, a broad pointed bill, and strong legs. Often detected by characteristic “cooeet” calls given at dawn and in early evening. Buff-banded Rail is smaller and more boldly marked, with a rufous eye-stripe and a broad orange breast band."
0,Welcome Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Hirundo neoxena,https://ebird.org/species/welswa1,"Small swallow with long forked tail. Dark above, pale below, with a rusty breast and face. In Australia, much less common Barn Swallow has a dark chest band and is much paler below, including parts of the underwing. Common bird across open habitat, where it feeds on insects above parks, sporting fields, wetlands, and other open areas. Perches on fence rows and utility lines in large numbers."
0,West African Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis occulta,https://ebird.org/species/weabat1,"A classically patterned batis of forest, forest edges, villages, and towns in tropical lowlands and foothills. Males have white underparts bisected by a black chest band, mostly black upperparts with a broken white eye-line, white on the nape, scalloped white and gray on the back, and a white wingbar that extends to the tip of the wings in the secondary flight feathers. The female is similar but has less of an eyebrow, a grayer crown and back, and a reddish chest band. Overlaps with several other batis species, but note West African Batis’s combination of broken eyebrow and neat chest band. Song is a high-pitched series of buzzy calls and trills interspersed with whistles, often with the same whistled call being repeated at length."
0,West African Crested Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Thalasseus albididorsalis,https://ebird.org/species/royter2,"A large tern found strictly in coastal areas. Very pale, with a long forked tail. Shows a black cap and orange bill in breeding plumage, and a white cap, black back of the head, and yellow-orange bill when not breeding. Feeds in open ocean and saltwater bays, where it flies above the water looking for small fish. Rests on beaches, often in mixed groups with other tern species. Separated from most other terns by large size; only slightly smaller than Caspian. Separated from Caspian by the thinner orange bill (usually not deep red), shaggier crest, longer tail, and in flight the much paler wing, without a large panel of solid black. Similar to Lesser Crested Tern, but significantly larger and chunkier."
0,West African Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra canicapilla,https://ebird.org/species/sthsee3,"A medium-sized brown seedeater. Note the boldly marked face with a dark crown, a white eyebrow, and a broad dark-brown patch through the eye. The underparts lack streaking, but may show some brown blotching. Found in woodland, scrub, and cultivated areas. Often in pairs or small flocks. Similar to Reichard's Seedeater, but there is little overlap in range, and West African is easily separated by the unstreaked underparts. Somewhat similar to White-rumped Seedeater, but lacks a white rump, and has a strong facial pattern and unstreaked underparts. Gives a pretty, musical up-and-down song of whistles and trills which also sometimes includes imitations of other birds."
0,West Himalayan Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella kashmirensis,https://ebird.org/species/spobuw2,"A small, brownish bird with a thick, rounded tail. Note the black bill, the gray underparts, and the contrasting darker gray sides of the breast. The buff-breasted morph is less common and lacks any gray. Inhabits alpine scrub in the summer. Possibly winters lower down in the plains. The song consists of short clicks and buzzes. Extremely similar to Spotted Bush Warbler; the West Himalayan Bush Warbler is slightly paler, but best told apart by range and song."

0,West Indian Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/weiwoo1,"A medium-sized woodpecker of drier forests including palm groves. Its strongly barred back eliminates all other species in it range except for Northern and Fernandina’s Flickers, but both flickers lack the West Indian Woodpecker’s extensively red nape and hind-crown. The barring on the back of the Northern Flicker is also far less pronounced than it is on West Indian Woodpecker. Common vocalizations include a staccato “pee-uh-uh-uh-uh…” with accent on first note, and emphatic bursts of “bluhhh, bluhhh, bluhhh,” with notes that are both harsh and slightly trilled."
0,West Mexican Chachalaca,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Ortalis poliocephala,https://ebird.org/species/wemcha1,"Noisy, long-tailed game bird of tropical forest and edge, usually found in small groups. Most often detected by its raucous song, which carries well. It feeds on fruit and plant material on the ground and also high in trees, where it runs along branches. For a big bird, it can be surprisingly hard to see. It is wary in areas where it is hunted and it slips away from view quite easily. In southwest Chiapas, the smaller White-bellied Chachalaca lives in coastal lowlands, while the West Mexican Chachalaca lives in foothills."
0,West Peruvian Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Zenaida meloda,https://ebird.org/species/wepdov1,"Common and conspicuous dove of desert lowlands and foothills.

0,Western Meadowlark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Sturnella neglecta,https://ebird.org/species/wesmea,"Streaked brown above and yellow below with distinctive black ""V"" on breast. In flight, short wings and spiky tail with white outer feathers are apparent. Breeds in fields and grasslands throughout much of western North America, regularly as far east as Michigan. Winters in a wider range of open habitats, even agricultural fields and roadsides. Extremely similar to Eastern Meadowlark and best distinguished by voice: listen for musical gurgling song and ""chuk"" calls. In winter, plumage looks paler and more washed-out than Eastern Meadowlark, with a less contrasting head pattern. Western is also more likely to be in flocks and areas with shorter grass (less pristine, extensive grasslands)."
0,Western Nicator,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nicatoridae,Nicator chloris,https://ebird.org/species/yesnic1,"An unusual bushshrike-like bird with a heavy hooked bill, olive-green above and pale below with bold white spotting on the wings. The yellow corners of the tail can be conspicuous in flight. Found in rainforest, gallery forest, thickets, lush secondary habitat, and dense woodland. Skulking and secretive, usually remaining in tangled understory and mid-level vegetation. Very similar to Eastern Nicator, but their ranges do not overlap. Also similar to Yellow-throated Nicator, but larger, without a bright yellow throat and streak above the eye. Very vocal and most often detected by voice; the song is a quick jumble of wooden notes, and the common call is a penetrating “chaak.”"
0,Western Olivaceous Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Iduna opaca,https://ebird.org/species/weowar1,"Large buff-colored warbler with a heavy flat bill and long tail. Olive-gray upperparts contrast with the pale bill. The pale lores separates this species from the similar Eastern Olivaceous Warbler and it doesn’t make downward tail movements like Eastern. Song contains several irregular notes and clicks. Found in light woodland gardens, orchards, plantations, oases and areas with dense bushes."
0,Western Black-headed Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus brachyrynchus,https://ebird.org/species/wbhori1,"An Old World oriole with mostly yellow plumage, a black hood, and a red bill. Note the fairly plain olive-and-black wing with a small white patch along the front edge. Found in rainforest canopy at low and middle elevations. Similar to Black-winged Oriole and found in the same habitat, but distinguished by the olive-green rather than black center of the tail and by the white patch on the wing. Also similar to African Black-headed Oriole, but usually separated by habitat and range. Further distinguished by the wing pattern, which is plainer, without bold white feather edgings."
0,Western Parotia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Parotia sefilata,https://ebird.org/species/wespar1,"A large bird of mid-montane forest canopy.

Female similar to Vogelkop Lophorhina but Western Parotia female is larger with a moustache stripe and blue eyes. Vocalizations include parrotlike squawking and a loud nasal “raak!”."
0,Western Reef-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Egretta gularis,https://ebird.org/species/werher,"Gangly heron with significant variation in plumage. Distinct dark morph is slate-gray with a white throat, while the palest morph is white with a yellow bill and lores. Pale gray intermediate morphs can also be found. Little Egret can look similar, but it has a darker bill than the white morph of the Western Reef-Heron. Primarily a coastal inhabitant, foraging on shorelines and in estuaries, but can also be found at some inland water bodies."
0,Western Rock Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta neumayer,https://ebird.org/species/rocnut1,"Slightly larger than Eurasian Nuthatch. Bill is longer and stronger than Eurasian Nuthatch with paler underparts. It favors mountainous rocky habitats and is seen actively feeding on boulders and cliffs, not normally on trees like Eurasian Nuthatch. Eastern Rock Nuthatch is larger and heavier than Western Rock Nuthatch with a big bill and thicker black eye stripe. Builds a unique, huge mud nest that it sticks to cliffs and rocks and uses year-round. Song and call are a loud and bubbling series of descending whistles “Piu-piu-piu-piu…” or “Pi pi pi pu-pu-pu-pu…”"
0,Western Rosella,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Platycercus icterotis,https://ebird.org/species/wesros1,"Red-and-green rosella with a yellow cheek in adults. The only rosella found in southwestern Western Australia, where it inhabits open woodland habitats and parks, usually feeding on the ground.

0,Western Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris mauri,https://ebird.org/species/wessan,"Small sandpiper with relatively long, droopy bill (longer on females). In breeding plumage, shows rich rufous tones on shoulders, cheeks, and crown. Nonbreeding is plain pale gray above and white below. Juveniles look pale-faced and have a bright strip of rufous feathers on the upper edge of the wings. Most similar to Semipalmated Sandpiper, which averages shorter-billed and duller grayish-brown overall. Extremely difficult to distinguish in winter; note Western is somewhat larger-headed and more front-heavy. Droopy bill might recall Dunlin, but Western is smaller and paler. Breeds on high Arctic tundra in Alaska. In migration and winter, occurs in large flocks on mudflats and beaches. Much more common in western North America; uncommon to rare on the east coast. Occurs in the winter in the U.S., unlike Semipalmated Sandpiper; regularly winters as far south as Peru, rare to Chile."

Underparts are pale with dark, vertical streaks. Also note stout, yellowish bill, and brown cap and back. Very similar to Eastern Striolated-Puffbird (limited overlap in Brazil and possibly Bolivia), but has thicker streaks on underparts. Singles or pairs perch motionless for long periods high in the canopy; usually heard before seen. Typical song is a whistled “wip wip-whirrr?, whurrrr”, with the other member of the pair responding at slightly different pitch."
0,Western Subalpine Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca iberiae,https://ebird.org/species/subwar6,"A small, slim warbler with a long tail. Breeding males are distinctive, with gray upperparts contrasting with a puffy rufous throat and breast, and a bold white moustache mark. Female and non-breeding males resemble a washed-out version of the breeding male, with much less rufous below. Typically found in scrubby, dense bushy habitats, but also in more open woodland and savanna. Sings from the tops of bushes, giving a rattling and loud sequence of notes. The call is a dry ""tek"" note, which is also incorporated into the song. Very similar to Moltoni’s Warbler, and best separated by call (single notes rather than dry rattles); breeding male is also richer rufous below. Also very similar to Eastern Subalpine Warbler, but call is subtly different: Western’s is slightly harsher, with only one syllable. Breeding males are separated visually from Eastern by having more rufous on the belly, a paler face, and a narrower white moustache."
0,Western Swamphen,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Porphyrio porphyrio,https://ebird.org/species/purswa1,"Fairly common but very local in Mediterranean region; escapes occur occasionally in northern Europe.

Brown above and white below with an orange nape and a small black mustache stripe. Slender white eye crescents give it a “spectacled” appearance on top of a whiskered one. Like other yuhinas, a very social bird, often seen foraging in the lower and middle levels of hilly broadleaf forests, sometimes with other species. Calls are usually an explosive pair or triad of notes that can be likened to “pee-bee!” or “pee-ah-bee!”"
0,Whistler's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus whistleri,https://ebird.org/species/whiwar2,"One of a confusingly similar complex of species, this medium-sized warbler has a bright yellow eye-ring, a pale and indistinct wingbar, and a grayish crown bordered by two long black stripes. The weakness and greenish cast of the gray crown separates this species from various other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, such as Gray-crowned. Golden-spectacled Warbler is very similar; in Whistler’s, look out for an unbroken eye-ring, a shorter bill, a longer tail, and slightly duller green upperparts. Whistler’s breeds in high-altitude temperate broadleaf forest from around 2000 meters up to the treeline; averages higher in altitudinal breeding preferences than Golden-spectacled Warbler. Like other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, Whistler’s typically forages at lower and middle levels of forest, often mixing with other species and making flycatching sallies. Song consists of a 2- or 3-noted whistled phrase repeated 2-3 times without pause, lacking the trills of Golden-spectacled Warbler."
0,Whistling Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola lateralis,https://ebird.org/species/whicis1,"Large, plain cisticola. The most outstanding aspects of the plumage are the white underparts and two bands across the tip of the tail, one pale and one black. Found in a variety of open habitats, including moist savanna, scrub, overgrown cultivation, and forest edge and clearings. The distinctive song is a quick, liquid warble, given from a prominent perch. As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Fairly similar to Singing Cisticola, but lacks a rufous cap and panel in the wings. Also similar to Trilling and Chattering Cisticolas, but lacks rufous on the cap."

Shows considerable variation in plumage across the world, but never has a clear, thin and contrasting eye-brow like White-browed or Japanese Wagtail. Occurs in varied open habitats, from wild grassy areas and wetlands to paved car parks and grassy lawns. Usually seen as singles, pairs, or small groups walking and running around, pumping the long, white-sided tail up and down. Identified easily in flight by its loud, thick and distinctive “tsee-tsee’ call."
