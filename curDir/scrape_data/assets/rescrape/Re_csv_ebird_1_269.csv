0,Akekee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxops caeruleirostris,https://ebird.org/species/akekee,"A small, very rare Hawaiian honeycreeper of remote native forests on Kauai. Declining rapidly; found only above 4,000 feet elevation in the eastern ‘Alaka’i Plateau. Males are yellow with a small black mask and females are greenish. The crossed bill that is uses to pry open leaf buds in search of insects and larvae is difficult to see. The longer tail with a notched tip distinguishes it from other small honeycreepers. Its rarely-heard song is a wavering trill that changes in speed and pitch. Call is a soft upslurred “suweet.”"
0,Akiapolaau,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Hemignathus wilsoni,https://ebird.org/species/akiapo,"A rare Hawaiian honeycreeper of native forests above 5,000 feet elevation on Hawaii Island. Appears bigger-headed and shorter-tailed than other honeycreepers. The long, thin upper bill can be hard to see. The stout lower bill is used to hammer like a woodpecker, making an audible tapping sound. Forages for insects on large branches. Male song is a loud, complex warble. Its “Chu-wee” and “Teedle-oo” calls are lower-pitched and louder than those of other honeycreepers."
0,Akikiki,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Oreomystis bairdi,https://ebird.org/species/akikik,"A small, very rare Hawaiian honeycreeper of remote native forests on Kauai. Declining rapidly; found only above 4,000 feet elevation in the eastern ‘Alaka’i Plateau. Gray above and whitish below with a pink bill and a short tail. Juveniles have white spectacles. Forages by creeping on branches, rarely in foliage.

0,Anianiau,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Magumma parva,https://ebird.org/species/aniani,"A small Hawaiian honeycreeper of high elevation native forests on Kauai. Males are bright yellow and females are yellowish green. Smaller than the Kauai Amakihi with a straighter bill and without the faint black line between the bill and the eye. Moves quickly and incessantly in the understory and forest canopy in search of nectar, insects, and fruit. Fairly common in more remote areas of the eastern Alakai Plateau; uncommon to rare in the western Alakai and Kokee State Park. Song is a trill consisting of paired notes “weesee-weesee-weesee.” Call is a soft upslurred “su-weet.”"
0,Apapane,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Himatione sanguinea,https://ebird.org/species/apapan,"A blood-red Hawaiian honeycreeper found on all of the larger islands. Smaller and darker red than the Iiwi, with a shorter black bill and white under the tail. Juveniles are brown instead of red. Sometimes abundant in native forest at high elevations and also occurs at lower elevations in some areas where it usually stays high in the forest canopy. Large numbers may congregate in a flowering tree. Sometimes holds the tail cocked up. Often flies in flocks, sometimes high above the forest. Song consists of 2–3 soft notes followed by a reedy trill: “dee-der-di-di-di-di.”"
0,New Zealand Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Oceanitidae,Fregetta maoriana,https://ebird.org/species/nezstp1,"Small seabird endemic to New Zealand.

Note especially long legs, with feet trailing well behind the square tail. Thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 2003 on Little Barrier Island, which remains the only known breeding location. At sea, recorded mostly around New Zealand’s northern waters. Four similar species: Wilson’s Storm-Petrel has dark underparts and underwing; Black-bellied Storm-Petrel is larger, with shorter legs that still extend past tail and with a white belly that has a black line down the middle; White-bellied Storm-Petrel is larger, with feet that do not extend past tail; Gray-backed Storm-Petrel does not have a white rump."
