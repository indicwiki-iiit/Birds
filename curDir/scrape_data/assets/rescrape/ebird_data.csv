0,Abbott's Booby,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Sulidae,Papasula abbotti,https://ebird.org/species/abbboo2,"Gangly, stretched-out-looking black-and-white seabird. Strikingly slender and strange-looking in flight. Breeds in the rainforest canopy of Christmas Island, and forages in the adjacent ocean. Some birds, especially immatures, will forage much farther afield, but the extent of these rangings is still poorly understood. Bizarre long-necked and slender-winged profile is unique, and should readily distinguish this species from any others in range. Bill is pale pink in females and grayish in males."
0,Abbott's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Poeoptera femoralis,https://ebird.org/species/abbsta2,"A small, distinctive starling with a tiny range in Kenya and Tanzania. The male has a blue-black back and breast and a white belly. Females have a brown back and breast and a pale belly with brown streaks. Both sexes show a yellow eye. Uncommon and local in montane forest. Found in the canopy, in pairs or small flocks, often perching up conspicuously on dead snags and other open perches. Similar to Sharpe’s Starling, but has a dark breast. The calls include a sharp “sveet” and the song is a rapid, high-pitched tinkling phrase."
0,Abdim's Stork,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Ciconia abdimii,https://ebird.org/species/abdsto1,"A medium-sized, dark stork with a white belly. This gregarious African migrant often appears in huge nomadic flocks numbering in the thousands, normally in response to heavy rains or large fires, after which they forage on insect emergences. It prefers open grassland and woodland but also uses wetland margins and fields. Could be confused with the more solitary Black Stork, but Abdim’s Stork is smaller, has a white rump, and has a green-gray (not red) bill and dull (not bright red) legs."
0,Aberdare Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola aberdare,https://ebird.org/species/abecis1,"A large and relatively colorful cisticola endemic to Kenya, found locally in montane grassland and moorland. The cap and back of the neck are dull rufous with darker streaking, the back is heavily streaked with black, and there is a rufous panel in the wings. As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Very similar to Stout Cisticola, but has streaking on the back of the neck. The common vocalizations are a quick series of several squeaky notes, and a series of lower liquid notes."
0,Aberrant Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Horornis flavolivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/abbwar1,"Small shy warbler. Dull brown with a paler belly and brow stripe. Like most bush-warblers, difficult to see as it moves through dense foliage. Listen for its sweet song, consisting of a few introductory notes followed by two long whistles: “ti-ti-tchew weeeeee-cheeeeee’. Visually very difficult to separate from Yellowish-bellied Bush Warbler and Brownish-flanked Bush Warbler, and differences are extremely subtle. Himalayan breeders average more greenish on the back than either of the other two species, and have a strong yellow wash on the belly; Brownish-flanked, with which Aberrant overlaps in the eastern Himalayas, is much browner overall. In central China, Aberrant overlaps with Yellowish-bellied, which has a pale gray throat instead of a yellowish-buff one. Aberrant breeds in shrubby edge, bamboo stands, and open bushy areas in montane and hill areas; upper altitudinal limit averages higher than both Yellowish-bellied and Brownish-flanked."
0,Abert's Towhee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Melozone aberti,https://ebird.org/species/abetow,"Large, plain, long-tailed sparrow. Drab grayish-brown overall, with dark mask like a Northern Cardinal. Also note pinkish bill and orange undertail coverts. Inhabits riparian corridors, especially in dense brush. Mainly occurs in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona, barely extending into surrounding states and northern Mexico. Rather secretive as it forages on the ground for seeds and insects. Visits feeders."
0,Abyssinian Catbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Sylvia galinieri,https://ebird.org/species/abycat1,"An unusual and distinctive warbler of the Ethiopian highlands. Mostly gray with chestnut under the tail, a red eye, black between the eye and bill, and a white patch above the eye. Found in dry montane juniper and hagenia forest. Easily separated from other gray warblers by the dark gray underparts and rufous undertail. Sometimes skulking, but will sing in the open; the male’s song is an explosive, variable combination of musical, fluted notes, usually accompanied by low ratcheting from the female."
0,Abyssinian Crimsonwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Cryptospiza salvadorii,https://ebird.org/species/abcwin1,"Small, dark member of the waxbill family. The back is red, the wings and tail black, and the underparts gray. Males and females are similar, though males show a bit of red on the flanks. Found in montane forest, mainly in thick and wet areas such as along streams, including forest edge and glades. Inconspicuous bird that is usually found in pairs or small groups. The call is a high-pitched “tsit.” Similar in size and overall coloration to Red-faced Crimsonwing, but darker, and doesn’t show red or yellow on the face."
0,Abyssinian Ground-Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucorvidae,Bucorvus abyssinicus,https://ebird.org/species/noghor1,"A huge ground-dwelling hornbill. Males have a mix of blue and red bare facial skin, while females have entirely blue facial skin. In flight, a large white patch is revealed in the wings. Found in savanna, grassland, and agricultural habitats, usually in pairs or small groups, walking on the ground. Breeds and roosts in trees. Similar to Southern Ground-Hornbill, but there is little overlap in range, and Abyssinian is easily separated by the blue facial skin. The call is a series of deep “boop” notes."

In flight, the spectacular wings are half pale blue and half dark blue. Found in dry savanna and other open country. Usually seen singly or in pairs. Easily separated from Lilac-breasted Roller by the blue throat. Occasionally lacks elongated outer tail feathers, and then very similar to European Roller, but separated by the dark blue rather than black outer wing. The calls are rough rasps."
0,Abyssinian Scimitarbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Phoeniculidae,Rhinopomastus minor,https://ebird.org/species/absbil1,"This all-black bird has a curved orange bill and a fairly long tail. Northern birds have white bars across the wings, which are conspicuous in flight, while southern birds have entirely black wings. Found in dry savanna and thornscrub. Separated from other scimitarbills by its orange bill. Similar to some woodhoopoes, but separated by its smaller size, shorter all-black tail, and black legs. Vocalizations include a series of wavering, rising notes and an agitated-sounding series of “dok” notes."
0,Abyssinian Slaty-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis chocolatinus,https://ebird.org/species/abyslf1,"A gray-brown flycatcher endemic to the Abyssinian highlands. Darker on the upperparts and paler below with a distinctive white eye. Found in montane habitats including woodland, forest edge, and lush gardens. Could be confused with African Gray or Pale Flycatchers, but found in different habitats, and easily identified by the pale eye. Found in the same areas as African Dusky Flycatcher, but larger, with a pale eye."
0,Abyssinian Ground-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Geokichla piaggiae,https://ebird.org/species/abgthr1,"Large, brown-backed, orange-breasted thrush with bold white wingbars.

0,Abyssinian Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe lugubris,https://ebird.org/species/mouwhe4,"A dark wheatear in which males and females are very different. Males are black above with a dark-streaked gray cap. There is individual and geographical variation in belly color, which can be either black or white. Females have a dark brown back and heavily streaked paler underparts. Both sexes have a buff undertail and a black-and-buff tail with a “T” pattern that is conspicuous in flight. Found in rocky areas with some trees and shrubs. White-bellied males can resemble other wheatears, but are distinguished by their black-and-buff tail. The song is a long, musical jumble of whistles and chatty notes."
0,Abyssinian Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Chloropicus abyssinicus,https://ebird.org/species/abywoo1,"A small, short-tailed woodpecker of the Abyssinian highlands. Note the pure golden-green back and the white facial streaks that frame a dark cheek. Males have a red cap and females a dark one. Found in montane woodland and open forest. Within its small range, most similar to Cardinal Woodpecker, but separated by the slightly larger size, the dark cheek, and the brighter yellow back. Quiet and inconspicuous, but sometimes gives a high, rattling call."
0,Acadian Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax virescens,https://ebird.org/species/acafly,"Small flycatcher with big peaked head and relatively long bill. Extremely similar to several other species, especially Alder and Willow Flycatchers. Greenish-olive above and pale whitish below. Note thin white eyering and very long wingtips. Best distinguished from other flycatchers by habitat and voice. Birds near the northern end of breeding range prefer shaded ravines with mix of hemlocks and deciduous trees; farther south, found in mature deciduous forests. Tends to stay high in the canopy.

0,Aceh Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus snouckaerti,https://ebird.org/species/orsbul2,"Rare and declining endemic of Sumatra’s northwestern mountains. Large grayish-brown bulbul with a bright orange forehead patch, dark olive wings, and a weak crest that gives it a pointy-headed profile. Once regarded as a subspecies of the very similar Orange-spotted Bulbul, but note present species’ distribution and dark (not white) belly. Inhabits foothill and lower montane forests, where localized and largely restricted to clearings with a substantial understory. Calls are generally similar to those of Orange-spotted Bulbul, and include a bubbly chatter."
0,Acorn Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes formicivorus,https://ebird.org/species/acowoo,"Medium-sized woodpecker with unique face pattern: red crown, pale yellowish forehead and throat, and pale eye. Otherwise glossy-black with streaky underparts. In flight, look for blazing white rump and wing patches.

The back and underparts are variably spotted and barred. The throat is gray in the male and white in the female. It swims slow and low in the water with its tail held on the surface. This secretive bird moves in pairs on perennial rivers, swamps, and quiet clear backwaters, foraging under overhanging cover for invertebrates, frogs, and fish. The short, thick neck and bright-colored bill and feet differentiate it from darters and cormorants."
0,African Firefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lagonosticta rubricata,https://ebird.org/species/afffin,"Small brown and reddish waxbill with a blue-gray bill and black under the tail. Varies geographically, but in many areas, has a mostly gray head. Found along forest edge and in cultivation, thick woodland, and scrub. Usually in pairs or small groups. Call is a short, low trill. Quiet song is a mix of low trills and much higher-pitched whines and whistles. Similar to Red-billed and Bar-breasted firefinches but shows black under the tail. Subspecies without gray on the head can be extremely similar to Jameson’s Firefinch, but they are darker and less pinkish overall."
0,African Fish-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Haliaeetus vocifer,https://ebird.org/species/affeag1,"The adult is a large, distinctive, chestnut-and-white eagle that sits prominently on perches near rivers, lakes, and other waterbodies. The scruffy immature is dark brown and mottled with white on head. In flight the white windows in the wings and pale, dark-tipped tail make the juvenile distinctive. It catches fish with a graceful, shallow plunge to the water’s surface, but it will also eat birds, reptiles, and carrion. It tosses its head backwards while making a loud penetrating “wheeee-ah-kleeuw-kleeuw-kluuu” call; it is one of the most distinctive bird sounds of Africa."
0,African Golden Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus auratus,https://ebird.org/species/afgori2,"Typical Old World oriole with mostly yellow plumage and a red bill.

0,African Jacana,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Jacanidae,Actophilornis africanus,https://ebird.org/species/afrjac1,"A distinctive chestnut, white, and black waterbird with a sky-blue bill and enormous feet. The immature lacks the blue bill and shield and is brown-headed. Resident and nomadic, this species trots on the surface of water lilies and other aquatic vegetation, using its long legs and ludicrously elongated toes to prevent it from sinking. It flies weakly, low over the water, with legs and toes dangling behind awkwardly, and calls with a honking repeated “kyaaan” and wheezy hurried “skreeeeeet’--most often in flight. Highly unusual mating system in which one dominant female maintains a harem of multiple males. After egg-laying, each male will raise a brood alone."
0,African Marsh-Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus ranivorus,https://ebird.org/species/afmhar1,"Large, brown, wetland harrier. Like all harriers, has long, slender wings and tail, and graceful, swooping flight. Found in and around marshes, swamps, and wet grasslands. Dark brown overall coloration separates it from all other harriers except female Eurasian Marsh-Harrier. African Marsh-Harrier can be identified by the presence of barring in the wings and tail, as well as by its darker head."
0,African Openbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Anastomus lamelligerus,https://ebird.org/species/afrope1,"A medium-sized, all-dark stork with a mostly greenish gloss and a uniquely-shaped bill that creates a diagnostic gap between the two halves of the bill. Its flight is slow and labored. The long neck and feet separate it from other dark waterbirds. It prefers still waters in shallow lakes, swamps, and seasonal pans, where it uses its odd bill to extract snails and mussels from their shells. A resident, migrant, and nomad; massive numbers can suddenly appear when conditions are favorable."
0,African Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus moquini,https://ebird.org/species/afroys1,"A plump, coastal shorebird that is glossy black in plumage with salmon-red legs and reddish eye, eye-ring, and bill. The juvenile is duller, with pink-brown bill and grayish-pink legs. Conspicuous on rocky coastlines and sandy shores, where it feeds on invertebrates like mussels, limpets, and worms. It is often first detected by its distinctive, high-pitched piping “pleek” and “peeka-peeka” alarm calls. Similar Eurasian Oystercatcher differs from African Oystercatcher by its white belly and throat."
0,African Palm-Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Cypsiurus parvus,https://ebird.org/species/afpswi1,"A very slender gray-brown swift with a long, deeply forked tail that is often held closed, making it look needle-like and pointed. The erratic flight pattern, with frequent direction changes and rapid wingbeats on long, scythe-shaped wings, is distinctive. Less gregarious than other swifts; usually found in pairs or small flocks, and association with other swallows and swifts is usually only fleeting. Forages over a wide variety of habitats with palms, including savanna, coastal scrub, towns, villages, cultivated areas, forest edge, and clearings, from sea level up to 1800 meters of elevation, preferring lowlands. Nests and roosts in palms and uses its tiny legs with hook-like claws to cling to the undersides of fronds. Gives a high-pitched, metallic “tre-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit” call, solitarily or in unison with others. Separated from other swifts by its longer and thinner tail."
0,African Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone viridis,https://ebird.org/species/afpfly1,"This remarkable flycatcher occurs in both rufous and white morphs, but it always has grayish underparts and a strong crest. The breeding male has ludicrous central tail feathers, twenty centimeters long, that trail like the ribbon of a rhythmic gymnast, while the female lacks the tail streamers and has a smaller crest. Singles and pairs occasionally join flocks in open woodland, riverine forest, and thickets, avoiding lowland evergreen forest. Very vocal, often giving a repeated grating “dzee-zwee” call and a sweet melodic “willie-willie-willie-wee-wooo” song. The very similar Rufous-vented Paradise-Flycatcher differs from African Paradise-Flycatcher by having a rufous undertail and a shorter crest."
0,African Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus demersus,https://ebird.org/species/jacpen1,"The only penguin regularly found within its range. A pudgy, flightless, black-and-white seabird with wings modified into flippers. Uncommon and declining, but still easily seen at well-known breeding colonies. It is extremely ungainly on land but is a supreme swimmer in the open ocean, where individuals dive down as far as 60 m in pursuit of small schooling fish. Juveniles are covered in flufflike down, and immatures have a white throat and frequently look scruffy as they molt. Call is a repeated, donkey-like braying: “haaaaaaahh, haaaaaaahh”."
0,African Piculet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Verreauxia africana,https://ebird.org/species/afrpic1,"A tiny woodpecker of forest and forest edge, more likely to be mistaken for a crombec than for another species of woodpecker. A squat bird with a round body, a large head, a short, stout bill, and a very short tail. Body is gray overall with greenish wings, white markings around the ears, and orange around the eyes. Males have an orange forehead. Voice is a weak trilling “si-si-si-si-si.”"
0,African Pied Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Lophoceros fasciatus,https://ebird.org/species/afphor1,"A small hornbill that is frequently encountered as it flies singly or in groups over the canopy, between forest gaps, and over road cuts. Distinctive, with a bright white belly and a black head, body, wings, and tail, giving it a bicolored appearance. The bill is pale yellow with a dark tip. Calls are a series of high-pitched whistles: “heu heu heu heu.”"
0,African Pied Wagtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Motacilla aguimp,https://ebird.org/species/afpwag1,"The only black-and-white wagtail in Africa shows a bold white eyebrow and wing panels and a broad black throat patch. The juvenile is brownish. Pairs and family groups frequent a broad range of habitats, including human-altered environments, but in drier areas they are associated with waterside habitats. The species runs on the ground foraging for insects, characteristically wagging its tail up and down in an exaggerated motion. The juvenile African Pied Wagtail may resemble the Cape Wagtail, but has extensive white panels in the wings."
0,African Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus cinnamomeus,https://ebird.org/species/afrpip1,"The default pipit across much of Africa. Brown above and pale below, with a streaked back, well-marked face, and white outer tail feathers. There is considerable geographic variation, from pale and sandy to rich brown and rufous. Found in a variety of open and usually grassy habitats, both near water and in dry areas. Call is a sneezing “tzsht”. Song comprises consecutive series of rattles, given in flight. Very similar to other pipits; some of the key features to look for include the yellow base of the bill, streaked back, and white outer tail feathers."
0,African Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Pitta angolensis,https://ebird.org/species/afrpit1,"An unusual and beautiful bird that is rarely seen, even by those expressly looking for it. Note the buffy underparts, green back, red undertail, and bold facial pattern. Found on the floor of forest and dense thicket. Very shy, remaining motionless for long periods. At least some populations are migratory within Africa. The call is an explosive, liquid “phwit.” Can only be confused with Green-breasted Pitta, but separated by the lack of a dark-green breast."
0,African Pygmy-Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Nettapus auritus,https://ebird.org/species/afrpyg1,"Colorful miniature waterfowl that is smaller than most ducks. Both sexes have rufous underparts, a dark back, white on the face, and white on the wing in flight. Males have a green patch on the back of the head and a yellow bill; females have a black-and-white head and a dark bill. Found in freshwater wetlands with floating vegetation, especially water lilies. Shy and inconspicuous, as it generally avoids open water. Voice is a high-pitched squeaking. Small size and bold and colorful plumage separate it from other waterfowl."
0,African Pygmy Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Ispidina picta,https://ebird.org/species/afpkin1,"Tiny, gem-like, woodland kingfisher. Note the orange face with a purple cheek mark and the narrow, dark blue crown. Found in the understory of woodland, thickets, and some forests. Inconspicuous bird that sits motionless for long periods before darting after prey. Call is a harsh “tsik,” often given in flight. Similar to Malachite Kingfisher, but smaller, has more orange on the face, and prefers upland habitats. Very similar to African Dwarf-Kingfisher, but pygmy-kingfisher has a dark crown."
0,African Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/afrrai1,"Classic, mid-sized rail. Note the brown back, gray head and chest, barred belly, and reddish bill and legs. Found in wetlands ranging from flooded grassland to deep swamps. Especially favors cattail marshes. Fairly reclusive but walks out into the open more often than most rails. Usually detected by call, a loud, accelerating series of notes that descend the scale. Shares a similar color pattern with African Crake, but African Rail has a longer bill and an unspotted back."
0,African Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus baeticatus,https://ebird.org/species/afrwar1,"A fairly small, plain and unstreaked warbler, brownish above and paler below. Very hard to distinguish from other reed warblers, although the relatively short, rounded wings are a useful feature. Song essentially identical to Eurasian Reed Warbler. Most safely identified on geographic range at seasons when migrant reed warbler species are absent. Largely restricted to marshy habitat, such as reed and sedge beds and the edges of papyrus, in addition to tall grass and bushes alongside rivers and ditches."
0,African River Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Pseudochelidon eurystomina,https://ebird.org/species/afrmar2,"Enigmatic and distinctive, this compact all-dark martin has striking red eyes and a bright orange-red bill. Juvenile is duller. In lethargic flight it appears bulky-headed, short-tailed, and triangular-winged. Small to large groups forage high over forested rivers, swamps, and coastal scrub. Birds migrate between two breeding areas, one in coastal central Africa from Gabon to northern Angola (August to December), and another farther inland, centered on the Congo River in west-central Democratic Republic of Congo (January to May), but their habits remain poorly understood. Calls include a scratchy chattering “skeer-skeer”; large flocks can become cacophonous."
0,African Sacred Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Threskiornis aethiopicus,https://ebird.org/species/sacibi2,"Striking white ibis with a naked black head and neck and black legs and feet. White wings framed by black wingtips and trailing edges. Can be encountered in almost any open habitat from wild wetlands to farmland and rubbish dumps. Originally restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, but now established in Taiwan and Europe, with feral colonies in France, Italy, and Spain."
0,African Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/afsowl1,"A small, compact, gray-brown owl with small ear tufts. It occupies moist woodland and arid savanna, provided there are trees with cavities for nesting. Its supreme wooden-stump-like camouflage keeps it well hidden during the day. At night a unique croaking frog-like “prreeeuup” call is repeated every 5–8 seconds, sometimes for long periods, and is the easiest way to track it down."
0,African Silverbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Euodice cantans,https://ebird.org/species/afrsil1,"A small, slender finch found in savanna, grasslands, fields, and thorn scrub. Cream-colored below and brown above with darker wings, a long, dark tail, and a thick silvery-gray bill. The tail is longer and more pointed than in other small finches. Often seen in flocks in semiarid savanna and plains, agricultural areas, and marshes. Male call is a metallic “tink” or “tsip”; female’s is a double note. Song is a peaking series of notes ending in a trill. Native to Africa; introduced to the Hawaiian Islands."
0,African Skimmer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Rynchops flavirostris,https://ebird.org/species/afrski1,"Distinctive tern-like bird with long wings, a short tail, and a bizarre bill in which the upper mandible is shorter than the lower mandible. In slow flight, shows a very white underwing and a white stripe along the back of the upperwing. Feeds by skimming its knife-like lower mandible through the water and snapping up small fish that it makes contact with. Found very locally on sandbars in lakes and rivers. Call is a husky “chep.”"
0,African Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago nigripennis,https://ebird.org/species/afrsni1,"Chunky, cryptic, short-legged, long-billed shorebird. In flight, shows much white on the outer tail and underwing. Found in thickly vegetated wetlands. Restricted to middle and high elevations across the majority of its range. Most often seen when it flushes explosively, often giving a rough “shrik” call. Display vocalization is a long accelerating series of “kik” notes, followed by a hollow booming made by the outer tail in flight display. Similar to Common Snipe, but darker and with much white in the outer tail. Also easily confused with the uncommon Great Snipe, but African is paler, lacks strong bars on the wing, and has a white rather than dark underwing."
0,African Spoonbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Platalea alba,https://ebird.org/species/afrspo1,"A distinctive pale waterbird with long pink-red legs, a bare bright pink-red face, and an odd and distinctive spoon-shaped bill that is obvious even in flight. The juvenile lacks the bright pink-red skin and has black tipped wings in flight. It breeds colonially in heronries. The African Spoonbill prefers large, quiet, shallow waterbodies where it forages by swinging its head from side-to-side, slicing its bill through the water, searching for small fish and aquatic invertebrates. It is mostly nomadic, wandering in response to local rainfall."
0,African Spotted Creeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Certhiidae,Salpornis salvadori,https://ebird.org/species/spocre2,"Although it is in a different family from the treecreepers, this species has typical creeper structure and behavior. The intricately spotted and barred plumage is gray-brown and white. Generally uncommon and local in a variety of moist woodland types, including miombo and Guinea savanna. Creeps its way up a tree, then flies down to start up another tree. The song is a quiet, high-pitched, up-and-down series of “seet” calls."
0,African Stonechat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Saxicola torquatus,https://ebird.org/species/afrsto1,"Small, chunky robin-like bird. Males are black and white, with a variable amount of rufous on the underparts. Ethiopian population has a black chest and no red. Females are dark brown on the back and pale below. Both sexes show a variable white wing patch. Found in a wide variety of open habitats, including grassland, heath, marsh, and scrub. Perches up conspicuously. Song is a quick jumbled mix of musical and raspy notes. Similar to the migratory Whinchat, but lacks conspicuous white eye-stripe, and shows white on the rump rather than the base of the tail."
0,African Swamphen,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Porphyrio madagascariensis,https://ebird.org/species/purswa2,"When seen in good light, shows spectacular purple, green, and pale blue coloration. In dull light, looks dark, but still shows red bill and feet and white undertail. Found in freshwater and brackish wetlands with thick vegetation, mainly at low and middle elevations. Gives a loud trumpeting call. Coloration similar to Allen’s Gallinule, but chunkier and larger, with a much larger bill. Larger than Eurasian Moorhen, with brighter coloration, red legs, and no yellow tip to the bill."

Note the orange bill and bare skin around the eye, and the white throat with black striping. Found in the thick undergrowth of a variety of habitats, including dry thorn savanna, scrub, and woodland. Fairly shy and retiring. There is only minor overlap in range with similar thrushes, such as African Thrush and Kurrichane Thrush, and in those areas, African Bare-eyed Thrush is easily identified by the bare skin around the eye. One common call is a short, low-pitched trill, and the song is a low-pitched combination of chatty whistles and trills, with frequent pauses."
0,African Wood-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix woodfordii,https://ebird.org/species/afwowl1,"Chunk brown mid-sized owl. Has a big, round head without ear tufts, heavy barring below, and white crescents on the face. Varies geographically from being dark brown to pale rufous-brown. Found in thick woodland, forest, gardens, and plantations. Male gives a long, rising “hu-wuuuuu” call, and both sexes give a gruff up-and-down series (“hu-ho-hu-ho-ho-ho”), often in duet. Larger than owlets, and lacks the ear tufts of eagle-owls."
0,African Yellow-Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Iduna natalensis,https://ebird.org/species/afywar1,"Mid-sized, long-billed warbler with rich yellow underparts and an olive-green back. The color of the cap varies geographically. In some subspecies, it is black, while in others, it is olive-green like the back. Found in wet scrub, often adjacent to wetlands. Generally skulks in thick undergrowth. Distinctive song is a couple of quick introductory chips followed by a vibrating trill. Other yellow-warblers are similar, but have a paler cap and are found in different habitats."
0,Agami Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Agamia agami,https://ebird.org/species/agaher1,"Reclusive, rarely seen heron of humid tropical lowlands. Found along quiet forest streams and locally in mangroves. Walks slowly and stealthily hunting from the water’s edge or a low overhanging branch. Note the very long and slender, dagger-tipped bill.

0,Ainley's Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates cheimomnestes,https://ebird.org/species/leastp2,"Rare and poorly known seabird found in the Pacific Ocean well off the coast of Mexico. It breeds in the winter on small islets near Guadalupe Island, located 160 miles from the mainland, and disperses southward during other times of the year. Plumage is dark gray with a notched tail, white rump patch, and pale stripes on the upperwing. The rump patch is variable in extent, and on some birds may be split down the middle by gray feathers. Identification is extremely difficult due to its similarity with other species, especially Townsend’s Storm-Petrel and Leach’s Storm-Petrel. Remains at sea when not breeding; flies erratically and often patters the ocean with its feet."
0,Alagoas Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula snowi,https://ebird.org/species/alaant1,"Very rare antwren, unmistakable in its tiny range, likely now restricted to one complex of humid forest fragments in the Brazilian state of Alagoas. Males are gray with a blackish throat and females are cinnamon-colored. Forages in the understory and middle levels of the forest, usually accompanying remnant mixed-species flocks. The song is a high sharp series of whistles."
0,Alagoas Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Mitu mitu,https://ebird.org/species/alacur1,"This impressive bird is found only in northeastern Brazil rainforest, and it is perilously close to extinction. Since the mid-eighties there have been no records of wild birds, and the species has only persisted in private aviaries. In 2019, several captive-raised birds were released into a reserve in the state of Alagoas as the first step in an ambition reintroduction program, but it remains to be seen if they will be able to survive and reproduce on their own. It is large and mostly glossy black, with chestnut lower underparts, red legs, and a bulbous, red bill. It is mostly terrestrial, but occasionally ascends to low branches."
0,Alagoas Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phylloscartes ceciliae,https://ebird.org/species/alatyr1,"Small flycatcher with a long tail, which is often held cocked. Has an olive back and whitish underparts. Note the two yellow wingbars and the white eyebrow.

0,Albert's Lyrebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Menuridae,Menura alberti,https://ebird.org/species/alblyr1,"A large brown bird with very long tail; the male’s is said to be lyre-shaped. These curved outer tail feathers are absent in juveniles and females, which can be mistaken for Superb Lyrebird, but location and underpart coloration (rusty tones in Albert’s) help in ID. Found in rainforests, where it forages in leaf litter for food. Usually heard before it is seen, it has a very powerful song and is known for mimicking other species. Note range, as this species is found only in a small region of Queensland and far northeast New South Wales."
0,Albertine Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium albertinum,https://ebird.org/species/albowl1,"Chunky brownish owlet. Shows bars and spots on the underparts and fine spotting on the nape and top of the head. Rare and enigmatic bird known from a small number of records in Albertine Rift montane forest. Gives a yelping series of “kow” notes, which are usually followed by emphatic, modulated, descending “ptrrrrr” notes. Very similar to African Barred Owlet, but has spotting rather than barring on top of the head, and a buff rather than white slash across the shoulder."

Found in all habitats with bushes and trees on the remote Seychelles island of Aldabra, including forest, mangroves, and thick scrub. Perches prominently in the open, swooping out to catch insects on the wing. Often follows Madagascar Coucals and Aldabra Giant Tortoises, feeding on insects that they disturb. Song is a repeated sequence of whistles, creaks, and rasps."
0,Aldabra Fody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia aldabrana,https://ebird.org/species/rehfod3,"A sparrow-like weaver. The mostly scarlet, yellow-bellied breeding males are distinctive, but females and non-breeding males are drab. Found in scrub, mangroves, and woodland on the island of Aldabra in the Seychelles. Similar to Red Fody, which recently reached Aldabra, and they have hybridized. Breeding males easily separated by their yellow belly. Females and non-breeding males very similar to those plumages of Red Fody, but can be cautiously separated by a stronger yellow wash, especially on the underparts and head. Calls are high, silvery notes, given in long series as a song."
0,Alder Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax alnorum,https://ebird.org/species/aldfly,"Small flycatcher, extremely similar to several other species. Prefers clearings and boggy areas, often with patches of alders. Grayish-olive above and pale below with thin white eyering. Wings dark with bold white wingbars. Nearly identical to Willow Flycatcher; once considered the same species. Also compare with Least Flycatcher, which is very similar but has slightly shorter wingtips and a bolder eyering. Best identified by voice: song is a rolling, rough ""freeBEER;"" call is a clear ""pip."" Silent birds, especially in migration, often best left unidentified."
0,Aleutian Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Onychoprion aleuticus,https://ebird.org/species/aleter1,"Beautiful, elegant tern of the Pacific Ocean. Breeding adults are silvery-gray overall with a black cap and crisp white forehead. Bill and legs are black.

In dull light, looks dark, but still shows red bill and feet, pale blue forehead shield, and white undertail. Juveniles are pale brown. Found in freshwater wetlands with thick vegetation, especially water lilies. Inconspicuous and shy, and will rarely emerge for long from thick cover. Call is a mournful wailing. Similar in coloration to African Swamphen, but slimmer and smaller, with a much smaller bill. Also similar to Eurasian Moorhen, but slimmer and smaller, with brighter coloration, red legs, and no yellow tip to the bill."
0,Allen's Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Selasphorus sasin,https://ebird.org/species/allhum,"Extremely similar to widespread Rufous Hummingbird; identical in plumage except for males' solid green back (which can be shown by Rufous too.) Breeds only along a narrow strip of coastal California and southern Oregon. See also: Rufous Hummingbird. On females and immature males, the only way to separate them from Rufous is by the shape of the tail feathers, which is extremely difficult to determine without good photographs."
0,Allpahuayo Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Percnostola arenarum,https://ebird.org/species/allant1,"Scarce antbird described to science in 2001. It is found in lowland rainforest in northeastern Peru, only in areas with white, sandy soil. Male is gray with a black throat and white wingbars. Female has gray upperparts with tawny underparts and wingbars. Very similar to Black-headed Antbird, and best identified by voice, range, and habitat. Inhabits dense understory, often in areas with lots of palm saplings. Song is a fairly rapid series of ringing notes, higher-pitched and faster than the song of Black-headed Antbird."

Greenish-brown with a bright yellow brow stripe and underparts. Lacks wingbars. Tickell’s has a paler throat and belly, as well as a slightly longer and straighter brow stripe. As the name indicates, this is a warbler of high-altitude areas, breeding in open areas with low vegetation. Wintering birds descend, often into scrubby patches, gardens, and forest edges. Song is an explosive burst of repetitive chittering notes, sharper-sounding than that of Tickell’s. Call is a dry “chit”."
0,Alpine Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus gutturalis,https://ebird.org/species/alppip1,"A medium-sized bird of Alpine Grasslands. Brown upperparts with faintly streaked back and crown, dark wing feathers with pale edges, cream to pale buff underparts and a broad pale eyebrow. Prefers short grass with bushes nearby. Similar to Australasian Pipit but Alpine is larger, found at higher elevations and has buffy underparts and unstreaked chest. A rich and varied song. Several whistled notes are given before changing to the next set with different pitch, tone, sometimes rising or falling."
0,Alpine Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus melba,https://ebird.org/species/alpswi1,"Spectacular and distinctive large swift, noticeably larger than Common Swift and Blyth’s Swift, but with slower wingbeats and a ""lazier"" and wider soaring flight. Dark brown overall with white belly; at close range, white throat patch is visible. Breeds colonially in cliff faces, mountains, larger buildings. Migratory in parts of its range."
0,Alpine Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera mollissima,https://ebird.org/species/alpthr1,"Chocolate-brown thrush with finely scaled white underparts. Very similar to Himalayan and Sichuan Thrushes, with which it was once considered a single species. Alpine is shorter-billed than the other two species, with a darker brown forehead than Sichuan Thrush; averages longer-legged and longer-winged than Himalayan Thrush. Long-tailed Thrush can also be similar, but lacks Alpine’s intense throat and chest speckling, and has thin but prominent pale wingbars. Alpine Thrush breeds in open rocky alpine areas with scattered shrubbery between 3000 and 4500 meters of elevation, though it descends lower into the foothills during winter. Song is simple but not altogether unmusical, consisting of fluid warbling notes and squeaky grating ones."
0,Alström's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus soror,https://ebird.org/species/pltwar1,"Sprightly, small warbler that poses a bevy of identification issues. Dull olive above and yellow below, with a bright eyering and a gray crown bound in by black stripes. Extremely similar to closely-related Martens’s, Gray-crowned, White-spectacled, and Bianchi’s Warblers; often impossible to identify if seen poorly in where range overlap is possible. Weak or absent wingbar distinguishes this species from Whistler’s, Bianchi’s, and White-spectacled warblers. Slightly larger-billed and shorter-tailed and with more restricted white in outer tail feathers than Martens’s and Gray-crowned warblers. Breeding altitudinal range (600–1500 m) can be helpful: does not overlap with higher-breeding Bianchi’s Warbler (1760–3100 m in China) and minutely with Martens’s Warbler (1200–2300 m). Overlap more extensive with Gray-crowned Warbler (120–1830 m in China) and White-spectacled Warbler (1000–1750 m in China). Simple, short song can be an identification clincher: a brief “che-witchy-chew-witchy-chew”, lacking the trilled notes of Martens’s, Gray-crowned, and White-spectacled warbler, and higher in pitch than Bianchi’s Warbler. Forages low, often in dense growth, of temperate evergreen forests, descending during the non-breeding season into forested lowlands, where overlap with non-singing similar species can make identification nearly impossible."
0,Alta Floresta Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Hylopezus whittakeri,https://ebird.org/species/alfant1,"Secretive species, almost tailless with long legs. Has a black-spotted breast, white throat, and conspicuous buff “goggles”. Found in humid forest with relatively dense undergrowth, where it moves quietly on the forest floor. Often perches on horizontal dead logs when singing its melancholy series of typically five whistles."
0,Altai Accentor,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Prunellidae,Prunella himalayana,https://ebird.org/species/himacc1,"Gray-brown overall with orange streaks on the breast and a white throat bordered by a thin black outline. Similar to Alpine Accentor, but darker and more extensively streaked. A common inhabitant of rocky alpine plateaus, meadows, and mountain slopes. Typically forages singly, but is often found in high numbers around campsites and towns where they scrounge for scraps."
0,Altai Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus altaicus,https://ebird.org/species/altsno1,"A burly brown inhabitant of high mountain passes, meadows, and plains, ranging from the low foothills up to isolated snowy peaks. The only snowcock throughout most of its range; minimal overlap with Himalayan Snowcock in far northwestern China and extreme northeastern Kazakhstan. Heavy contrast between the pale brown head and neck, white belly, and dark-brown-and-white back are unmistakable even from a distance and in poor weather conditions."
0,Altamira Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus gularis,https://ebird.org/species/altori,"Large bright orange oriole with thick dark bill, found in open shrubby woodland. Limited black on face and throat; black back and wings with white wingbar and orange shoulder patch. Young birds duller yellow. Most similar to Hooded Oriole but larger and stockier with orange shoulder patch and thicker bill. Song is a series of sweet, clear whistles like many other orioles, but slower with a more deliberate, even pattern. Visits fruit feeders."
0,Altamira Yellowthroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Geothlypis flavovelata,https://ebird.org/species/altyel1,"Brightly plumaged yellowthroat, restricted to northeast Mexico. Favors reed beds and adjacent marshy vegetation around lakes and ponds, also locally in cane fields. Common Yellowthroat is a common migrant throughout range of Altamira and is usually more numerous. Altamira is brighter yellow overall than Common. Male has yellowish border to black mask and extensively yellow underparts. Female is brighter and more extensively yellow on face and underparts than Common, but can be difficult to distinguish."
0,Amami Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera major,https://ebird.org/species/scathr6,"Large thrush, pale brown above, white below, with scale-like black-tipped feathers throughout the plumage. Inhabits undisturbed broadleaf evergreen forests of low elevations. Once considered a subspecies of White’s Thrush but now recognized as an endemic species of Amami and Kakeroma Islands. Amami Thrush is duller overall than White’s, which may appear during migration in the habitat of Amami. When foraging, Amami runs like a plover, stopping suddenly to listen for prey, whereas White’s walks along strangely, bobbing the head. Amami Thrush’s song distinctive and complex, very different from the simple song of White’s."
0,Amami Woodcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Scolopax mira,https://ebird.org/species/amawoo1,"Furtive, large, ground-dwelling shorebird endemic to the broadleaf forests of northern Okinawa Island and the Amami Islands. Similar to Eurasian Woodcock but darker overall, with notably longer legs and a thicker bill base. Patch of bare pinkish skin around the eye is diagnostic but absent in winter. Black bands on the top of the head not as thick and conspicuous as in Eurasian, which is a winter visitor. Like other woodcocks, displays both on the ground and in circular aerial displays. Flushes slowly and directly ahead."
0,Amani Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Hedydipna pallidigaster,https://ebird.org/species/amasun2,"A small sunbird with a short, slightly curved bill. Males are dark above and bright white below with an iridescent blue-green head and chest. Females are gray above and white below with an indistinct white eyebrow. Found very locally in forest and lush woodland at low elevations, mostly in the canopy. Female is similar to female violet-backed sunbirds, but is separated by the smaller size and the lack of a yellow wash on the underparts. The most distinctive vocalization is a two-part “twee-tree,” but also gives typical jumbled sunbird song."
0,Amazilia Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilis amazilia,https://ebird.org/species/amahum1,"A green-and-chestnut hummingbird with plumage that varies throughout its range. All variants have a red bill with a black tip. In most of its range, it has a green throat, white breast, and chestnut belly and tail. In the southern part of its range, white breast is reduced or absent and throat is blue or blue-green. At its northern limit, tail is mostly green. In the Andes of southern Ecuador, underparts are mostly white with only a little chestnut. Common in dry forest and scrub, and less prevalent or absent in more humid areas."
0,Amazon Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Chloroceryle amazona,https://ebird.org/species/amakin1,"Medium-sized kingfisher of tropical lowlands. Found singly or in pairs, along rivers and at the edges of ponds and lakes, often perched on wires or bare snags. Mainly flies low over the water. Size similar to Belted Kingfisher, but black bill much more massive and crest more tufted. Also differs from Belted in its dark oily-green head and upperparts. Green Kingfisher is much smaller with bold white spots and bars on the wings."
0,Amazonian Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Myrmothera berlepschi,https://ebird.org/species/amaant1,"Lowland rainforest antpitta of secondary growth. Typical antpitta shape, with long legs, almost no tail, and a plump body. Light brown above, white with diffuse brown streaking below, and a tawny wash on the face and breast. Lighter and more orangey than the similar Thrush-like Antpitta, which prefers more mature forest habitat. Does not have a strong facial pattern like other lowland antpittas. Secretive and difficult to see; listen for its song, a series of 3-5 loud “coop” notes."
0,Amazonian Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus amazonicus,https://ebird.org/species/amaant2,"Medium-sized, sluggish bird of tall rainforest. Males mostly gray and black; females very different, with dull to bright cinnamon head and breast, which can aid identification since this species generally occurs in pairs. Often found along river edges and in areas with much vine growth in the mid-story. Hops slowly through vegetation, searching for insects; found alone or with mixed-species flocks. Told from other antshrikes by song and brightly colored female; males have more extensive white wing markings than most other antshrikes. Song is a rapid series of notes with a trogon-like quality."
0,Amazonian Barred-Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Dendrocolaptes certhia,https://ebird.org/species/amabaw1,"Large reddish brown woodcreeper of lowland rainforest. Lightly barred from face to back and underparts; this barring can be quite diffuse and sometimes difficult to see in the field. Average-sized bill can be brown to dark red, depending on the population. A faint dark cheek pattern can often be seen. Similar to some other large unstreaked woodcreepers; weak pattern of horizontal barring and dark brown or red (not gray) bill help differentiate from Cinnamon-throated, Plain-brown, and White-chinned Woodcreepers. Prefers mature forest habitats, and is frequently found singly or in pairs around army ant swarms. Voice is a quick descending series of whistles, shorter and more quickly descending than Black-banded."
0,Amazonian Black-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Knipolegus poecilocercus,https://ebird.org/species/ambtyr1,"A rarely-encountered medium-sized dark flycatcher, most often found in flooded forests along rivers. Both males and females similar to the related Riverside Tyrant, but that species prefers more open habitat. Male Amazonian Black-Tyrant is shiny-black, smaller and glossier than male Riverside. Female Amazonian are warm brown with streaked underparts, considerably warmer in coloration than female Riverside. Notably quiet for a flycatcher."
0,Amazonian Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Cyanoloxia rothschildii,https://ebird.org/species/bubgro2,"Chunky, stout-billed bird of humid evergreen forest and edge in tropical lowlands. Occurs from throughout much of the Amazon basin (east of the Andes). Usually found in pairs, often skulking at low to middle levels in lush vegetation. In typical views, looks simply dark. Note the very stout bill and broad tail, which can be twitched side to side. Male is deep blue-black overall. Female is rich dark brown overall. Sharp squeaky call often doubled and rather distinctive."
0,Amazonian Motmot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Momotidae,Momotus momota,https://ebird.org/species/bucmot4,"Medium-sized motmot. Green with orange underparts, black mask, and blue crown. Other motmots in its range have orange heads. Found in the under and midstory of a variety of forest habitats, including humid forest, semi-humid forest, and forest edge. It often sits quietly on exposed perches, wagging its tail from side to side. Listen for its song, a low “BOO-boop” with the emphasis on the first syllable; often heard around dawn and dusk."
0,Amazonian Pygmy-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium hardyi,https://ebird.org/species/amapyo1,"Tiny owl of Amazonian lowlands. Found in a variety of habitats, including forest edges and mature rainforest. Gray head contrasts against broad reddish brown streaks down its white belly. Round head without ear tufts and largely white undersides distinguish it from screech-owls. Similar to larger Ferruginous Pygmy-Owl, but has a smaller, grayer head, and is less finely streaked. Also note vocal differences; Amazonian Pygmy-owl call is a rapid, slightly descending series of toots too fast to imitate. Sings mostly around dawn and dusk, but also sometimes during the day and at night."
0,Amazonian Scrub-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Sublegatus obscurior,https://ebird.org/species/amsfly1,"A confusing flycatcher, fairly small and nondescript. Look for the short bill and round head, sometimes raised into a slight crest. Dull grayish-brown head shows only a hint of a paler line above eye. Chest is paler gray, which blends into the pale yellow belly. Wingbars are present but not bold. Larger and lankier than a beardless-tyrannulet; looks rather like a diminutive Myiarchus flycatcher. Very similar to Southern Scrub-Flycatcher, which may overlap during the Austral winter, but note the overall darker coloration of Amazonian."
0,Amazonian Streaked-Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula multostriata,https://ebird.org/species/amasta1,"Small streaked antwren of riparian habitats. Males are white with black streaking; females are similar but with an extensive reddish wash. Tail very short in both sexes. Usually found in waterside vegetation around still or slow-moving water bodies like streams and lakes, where it forages low in vegetation overhanging the water. Gives two main songs: an even-pitched, accelerating trill of musical notes, and a slow ascending-descending series of whistled notes. The latter is one of the most characteristic bird sounds around oxbow lakes in Amazonia."
0,Amazonian Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Trogon ramonianus,https://ebird.org/species/viotro3,"Small yellow-bellied trogon of mature rainforest. Males are green with a blue head and breast and yellow eye ring, females dark gray with a broken white eye ring. Both sexes have yellow belly. Found in a variety of forested habitats, but usually a fairly uncommon species; most common in mature upland rainforest. Song is an even series of high “whew” notes, often sounding vaguely disyllabic, “whe-ew”; usually higher pitched and less breathy than Black-tailed."
0,Amazonian Umbrellabird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Cephalopterus ornatus,https://ebird.org/species/amaumb1,"Fantastic bird of the Amazonian region and adjacent Andean slopes. It looks like a huge crow with a bushy crest, a thick braid hanging from its throat, and pale eyes. Male is larger than female, with a longer (feathered) wattle and a white patch at the front of his crest. Flight is undulating and woodpecker-like. Inhabits tall rainforest, often along rivers, and males gather at display sites where they extend their wattles and give low pitched moos."
0,Ameline Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus amelis,https://ebird.org/species/palswi2,"Medium-sized brownish swiftlet with a weakly forked tail. Found only in the Philippine lowlands. Typically encountered alone or in loose groups over various open habitats, often soaring high. Fairly uniform brown plumage, lack of a pale rump, and size distinguish this species from most others in the area; Philippine Swiftlet is the most similar but is smaller, has a more square-tipped tail, and generally favors higher elevations (typically 700 meters and above)."
0,American Avocet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Recurvirostridae,Recurvirostra americana,https://ebird.org/species/ameavo,"Distinctive large shorebird with a long, thin, upturned bill. Look for bold black-and-white wings and long blue-gray legs. Breeding adults have buffy-orange wash on head and neck; grayish in winter. Females have more sharply upturned bills than males. Widespread and fairly common in North America, although rare or absent from much of the eastern U.S. Usually seen in flocks, sometimes numbering into the hundreds, foraging in shallow wetlands or estuaries. Feeds by swinging its head back-and-forth through the water to catch small invertebrates."
0,American Bittern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Botaurus lentiginosus,https://ebird.org/species/amebit,"Stocky, brown heron found in marshes and bogs. Usually secretive and difficult to see, but occasionally found in the open. Most similar to juvenile night-herons. Note striped neck, plain unspotted wings, and even more secretive behavior of bittern. Most active around dawn and dusk, when it might be seen flying low over extensive marshes. Listen for its incredible vocalization in the spring and summer: a resonant, booming noise produced by air sacs on the neck, “oonk-GA-loonk.” Also gives single low squawks."
0,American Black Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas rubripes,https://ebird.org/species/ambduc,"A large duck, nearly identical to Mallard in size and shape but with a much darker chocolate-colored body. Bill is yellow with a slight greenish tinge on males, dull grayish-green on females. Note blue wing patch lacks any white borders. Fairly common in northeastern North America, especially along the coast. Large flocks can gather in the winter in saltmarshes and estuaries, but also occurs in smaller numbers on ponds and lakes, often mixed with other duck species. Frequently hybridizes with Mallard. Hybrids usually look darker than typical Mallards and may have an intermediate head pattern; also look for white in the tail or curled feathers above the tail to indicate Mallard genes."
0,American Coot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Fulica americana,https://ebird.org/species/y00475,"Plump, chicken-like bird that acts like a duck. Gray overall with blacker head and white bill. Tiny tail and short wings. Feet are large, yellow-green, and oddly lobed. Head jerks back and forth when swimming. Forages for aquatic vegetation anywhere with water: ponds, city parks, marshes, reservoirs, lakes, ditches, and saltmarshes."
0,American Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus brachyrhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/amecro,"This is the common crow over much of the U.S. and Canada. Most easily identified by voice, a familiar “caw,” often repeated. Common in any open habitats, including fields, open woodlands, marshes, and cities, thriving around humans. Very social, usually seen in flocks, sometimes numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. Aggressive, sometimes seen chasing away hawks and owls. Separated from ravens by smaller size, smaller bill, shorter tail, and shorter, broader wings. Compare with Fish Crow, which is extremely similar in appearance, and best separated by voice. Includes the species formerly known as Northwestern Crow."
0,American Dipper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cinclidae,Cinclus mexicanus,https://ebird.org/species/amedip,"All-dark passerine that inhabits only fast-moving rocky streams in the West, from Alaska to Panama. Slaty gray overall with browner head. Forages for invertebrates by walking underwater. Unique shape, behavior, and strict habitat preferences make dipper unlikely to be confused with other species. Often nests under bridges."
0,American Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus ruber,https://ebird.org/species/grefla2,"Unmistakable but very local wading bird with very long, ‘coat-hanger’ neck and very long legs. Adult is hot pink, but 1st-year birds are brown and white overall, attaining fully adult colors in 2-3 years. Usually found in flocks in shallow, saline lagoons. Flamingoes fly in straggling lines, much like geese, and their honking and braying calls can also sound rather like geese. Beware that many people use ‘flamingo’ for Roseate Spoonbill, another (much more widespread) pink wading bird, which other than color is very differently shaped than a flamingo."
0,American Golden-Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Pluvialis dominica,https://ebird.org/species/amgplo,"Slender, long-winged plover usually found in relatively dry habitats. Breeding plumage shows black belly and face, white neck sides, and dark back and crown spangled with gold. Note sides and undertail coverts entirely black, but beware females and molting birds can be mottled with some white. Nonbreeding plumage is much drabber; grayish overall with distinct white eyebrow and dark cap. Juveniles are crisp and neatly spangled above, washed with gold on the upperparts. At all seasons, note slender shape and narrow bill to separate from Black-bellied Plover, along with grayish underwing in flight. Extremely similar to Pacific Golden-Plover; American is slightly longer-winged, shorter-legged, and smaller-billed, but these features are difficult to judge. Juvenile American is usually duller than Pacific, especially on the face and neck. Average habitat preferences are important (Pacific Golden and Black-bellied more regular on beaches and mudflats), but much overlap. Range is also important. Breeds on Arctic tundra. Fairly common migrant through central North America, uncommon on East Coast, rare on Pacific Coast. During migration, prefers sod fields, dry mudflats, and pastures; often in small flocks, sometimes mixed with Black-bellied Plover. Winters in South America. Note voice: a plaintive “pleedoo” call."
0,American Goldfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Spinus tristis,https://ebird.org/species/amegfi,"Small finch. Sharply pointed bill is pink in summer, grayish-brown in winter. Small head, long wings, and short, notched tail. Adult males in spring and summer are bright yellow with black forehead and wings. Females are dull yellow below and olive above with two distinct wingbars. In winter, they are drab, buffy-brown. Active and acrobatic. Sometimes in large numbers at feeders or on ground below. Found in weedy fields, cultivated areas, roadsides, orchards, and backyards."
0,American Kestrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco sparverius,https://ebird.org/species/amekes,"Petite falcon roughly the same size as Mourning Dove, but with a larger head and wider tail. In flight, note long, narrow wings and square-tipped tail. Often seen perched on telephone wires, along roadsides, in open country with short vegetation and few trees. From a perch or hovering, they usually drop to the ground to snatch small mammals and insects. Nests in cavities. Widespread across the Americas."
0,American Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus palliatus,https://ebird.org/species/ameoys,"Large, bulky shorebird with thick red bill. Unmistakable, striking plumage. Exclusively coastal; favors beaches where it feeds on shellfish and other invertebrates; less frequent in rocky areas. Gathers in flocks during migration and winter. Listen for loud yelps and whistles, often in a rapid series when excited. Hybrids with Black Oystercatcher occur locally in southern California and Baja; look for messy spotting where the black hood meets the white belly (sometimes very limited but often quite extensive)."
0,American Pygmy Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Chloroceryle aenea,https://ebird.org/species/ampkin1,"Tiny kingfisher of shady forest streams and mangroves. Often darts away when disturbed, but can be confiding if approached quietly and usually perches fairly low over the water. About half of the size of Green Kingfisher, and easily distinguished by rusty underparts and poorly contrasting pale neck collar (bright white on Green Kingfisher). Female has a narrow green breast band, lacking on male."
0,American Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga ruticilla,https://ebird.org/species/amered,"Adult males are striking and distinctive: mostly glossy black with bright orange flashes on the wings, tail, and sides. Females and young males are duller gray and olive with yellow patches instead of orange. Habitually flicks and fans tail while foraging for insects. Breeds in mature deciduous forests, often near water. Migrants can be found in any wooded habitat. Fairly extensive winter range throughout most of Middle America, the Caribbean, and northern South America. Song is extremely variable."
0,American Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus migratorius,https://ebird.org/species/amerob,"Fairly large songbird with round body, long legs, and longish tail. Gray above with warm orange underparts and blackish head. Hops across lawns and stands erect with its bill often tilted upward. In fall and winter, forms large flocks and gathers in trees to roost or eat berries. Common across North America in gardens, parks, yards, golf courses, fields, pastures, and many other wooded habitats."
0,American Tree Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Spizelloides arborea,https://ebird.org/species/amtspa,"Hardy northern sparrow with plump body, small bill and long, thin tail. Note rusty cap and rusty (not black) eyeline, gray head and unstreaked grayish breast with dark smudge in center. Small flocks hop on ground, foraging for seeds, giving a soft, musical twitter. In winter, look for them in weedy fields with shrubs, forest edges, and marshes. Readily visit backyards. Rarely seen south of northern Canada in summer."
0,American White Pelican,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Pelecanidae,Pelecanus erythrorhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/amwpel,"Extremely large and conspicuous. White with black wingtips. Very long, orange bill with pouch for scooping up fish. Forages in flocks, swimming together to concentrate fish. Often soars in flocks, infrequently flapping, during migration and when traveling between feeding sites."
0,American Wigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Mareca americana,https://ebird.org/species/amewig,"Breeding males have obvious white blaze on forehead and broad green slash behind eye. Females are plainer brown with rusty sides. Females are very difficult to distinguish from female Eurasian Wigeon; note colder grayish-brown head on American that contrasts with warmer orangey sides. Also look for brighter white, not gray, underwings in flight, but this can be difficult to judge, especially at a distance. Widespread and common in North America, occasionally wintering as far south as northern South America. Typically in flocks on lakes and wetlands, often grazing in nearby fields. Regular vagrant to Europe."
0,American Woodcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Scolopax minor,https://ebird.org/species/amewoo,"Plump, well-camouflaged shorebird that favors wooded or shrubby areas, usually near open fields. Plain buffy-salmon belly distinctive; also note intricately patterned upperparts with broad gray stripes down the back. Goofy-looking expression with huge dark eye placed high and far back on head. Extremely long bill used to probe the ground for worms. When flushed from dense cover, listen for high-pitched wing twittering and note rotund shape and long bill. Might be confused with Wilson’s Snipe, but woodcock is not nearly as dark and patterned. Fairly common throughout eastern North America, but secretive and rarely seen well in daytime. Always on the ground, except during well-known elaborate courtship display performed from dusk to dawn in spring. Listen for loud nasal “PEENT!” calls from the ground and high-pitched chirps and twitters (produced by the outer wing feathers) from high in the sky."
0,Amethyst Brown-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Phapitreron amethystinus,https://ebird.org/species/amedov1,"A medium-sized dove of foothill and montane forest. Brown on the upperparts, head, and chest, with a grayish belly and pale gray corners to the tail. Note the pale streak under the eye and the bare pink facial skin in front of and behind it. Similar to White-eared Brown-Dove, but Amethyst has purplish iridescence on the back of the neck and pale buff under the base of the tail. Voice includes a deep “hoop,” given singly or in series of two or three. Also gives a deep growling sound."
0,Amethyst Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Chalcomitra amethystina,https://ebird.org/species/amesun2,"Large sunbird with a long but thin bill. Males sometimes look all-black but also show green and maroon iridescent patches in good light. Females have pale eyebrows and streaked underparts. Found in forest, moist scrub, woodland, and gardens. Generally uncommon. The song is a mix of “chyup” notes and higher scratchy notes and twitters. Male is distinctive in good light. Female can be confused with female Scarlet-chested Sunbird but shows an eyebrow stripe and has streaks rather than smudges below. Also similar to female Green-throated Sunbird, but less boldly streaked below than that species."
0,Amethyst Woodstar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Calliphlox amethystina,https://ebird.org/species/amewoo1,"Tiny, short-billed hummingbird of forests, forest edges, and savanna woodlands. Both sexes are green on the back with a white band across the rump, but males have glossy pink throat and a deeply forked tail. Females have a white throat, a short tail, and cinnamon flanks and undertail."
0,Ampay Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus whitneyi,https://ebird.org/species/amptap1,"Dark gray tapaculo with a pale eyebrow known only from a few sites in the eastern Andes of southern Peru. While long known to be something different, it was finally described as a new species in 2020. Rump, tail, and lower underparts are brownish and faintly barred, though this is often hard to see in the field. The pale eyebrow is a good feature, but it is very inconspicuous on some birds, and ID is best confirmed by voice. Song is a slow, steady series of inflected chirps that may go on for a minute, and the notes sometimes have a buzzy quality. Inhabits high elevation forest and scrub near and above tree line. Stays low and often hops on the ground."
0,Amur Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco amurensis,https://ebird.org/species/amufal1,"The male of this small falcon is sooty gray with rufous-orange thighs and vent.

Similar to Golden-spangled and White-barred Piculets, but Arrowhead has chevron-shaped spots (not barring) on the breast and belly, and is strictly confined to coastal habitats."
0,Arrowhead Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga pharetra,https://ebird.org/species/arrwar1,"A small active species found high in moist woodlands. Frequently flicks its tail and often gives impression of being entirely heavily streaked. Blackpoll Warbler can be somewhat similar, but fall birds are tinged with some degree of yellow below, and spring males have a bold white cheek. Black-and-white Warbler is also similar, but it has bold black-and-white stripes (as opposed to distinct streaks as on Arrowhead Warbler) on crown and is usually found creeping along tree trunks or limbs. Call is a hard chip with a slightly squeaky quality. Song is relatively quiet and variable consisting of “tsi” notes; often with two or three introductory notes followed by one or two notes at a lower pitch then several notes at original pitch, given in rapid succession."
0,Ascension Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata aquila,https://ebird.org/species/asifri1,"A huge black bird with a very long hooked bill and a long, trailing deeply forked tail. Soars on giant wings, often harassing other birds to steal their food. Male is entirely black with a limited red throat. Female is black with a wide reddish chest band. Almost identical to Magnificent Frigatebird, but slightly smaller, with a more limited red throat patch. Lacks the pale upperwing panel of Great Frigatebird. Female is the only entirely dark female frigatebird; reddish chest band is diagnostic. Mostly pelagic."
0,Ash's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra ashi,https://ebird.org/species/ashlar1,"A chunky gray-brown lark with scaly-looking upperparts, a pink-buff mantle, and a red-brown wing panel. The pale eyebrow and buffy-white underparts are lightly streaked; the outer tail feathers are white. Rare and endangered, localized in coastal grassy plains on sand dunes with fossilized coral outcrops 80 kilometers north of Mogadishu. Vocalizations unknown. Most other larks within its range are browner or rufous on the upperparts."
0,Ashambu Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Montecincla meridionalis,https://ebird.org/species/kerlau3,"This is the only montane laughingthrush in its range and hence unmistakable. From forehead to nape it is pale brown with indistinct gray streaking. Short whitish eyebrow does not extend prominently behind the eye. Upperparts cold gray-brown, wings and tail browner; chin and breast whitish with broad gray streaking, central belly and vent white, flanks and sides of vent rufous-chestnut. Inhabits stunted montane and reed-bamboo forests; seen in pairs or noisy flocks, producing a melodious “pee-koo-pee-koo” song and several other chatters intermingled with musical notes. Heard more often than seen; its songs and calls are usually the first indication of its presence."
0,Ashy Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Hemixos flavala,https://ebird.org/species/ashbul1,"A particularly sharply-dressed bulbul. Throughout most of its range, gray overall with bright yellow-green wing panels, round brown ear patches, and a white throat. Birds in southern Indochina are browner overall, with less contrast. Dark bushy crest is often raised, giving the bird a messy-haired appearance. Inhabits a wide range of wooded habitats in foothill, submontane, and montane regions, often foraging in flocks with other bulbul species. Song consists of short, jumbled phrases of metallic warbled notes. Calls are variable, including both harsh chattering and tuneful piping notes."
0,Ashy Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola cinereolus,https://ebird.org/species/ashcis1,"A large, long-tailed, streak-backed upland cisticola. Note the lack of rufous or rich brown in the plumage, and also the pale tips to the tail. Found in dry thorn savanna and thornscrub. Similar to other cisticolas, especially Rattling, Tana River, and Boran, but identified by its song and by the absence of rufous or brown on the cap. Often sits on top of bushes and trees to sing. Song is a short musical whistled phrase, usually with a downward pitch trend, but sometimes trending upward. Much more musical than the song of Boran Cisticola, often with more variation in pitch. The calls are high-pitched squeaks."
0,Ashy Drongo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicruridae,Dicrurus leucophaeus,https://ebird.org/species/ashdro1,"A slim, medium-sized drongo with bright red eyes and gray plumage that is almost black in the western parts of its range and quite pale in the eastern parts of its range; eastern birds also often have an oval-shaped pale facial patch. It has a long slim tail with a deep fork. Common in wooded habitats where it sallies for insects and aggressively chases other birds that may compete for food or nectar. Most birds migrate south every winter. Similar to Black Drongo, but slimmer and usually in different habitats. Calls include harsh and sweet notes, and can mimic some bird species poorly."
0,Ashy Flowerpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum vulneratum,https://ebird.org/species/ashflo1,"A tiny, plump, short-tailed gray songbird. Male distinctive: uniform gray except for diagnostic prominent red breast patch and red rump. Female lacks chest patch, but still shows diagnostic red rump. Juvenile is gray, lacking any red.

Females lay eggs in the nests of other large birds, including crows, shrikes, and starlings. Song is a loud, persistent “ko-EL!” similar to a peacock’s call."
0,Asian Openbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Anastomus oscitans,https://ebird.org/species/asiope1,"A relatively small stork species with a grayish to white body and black wings and tail with a hint of gloss. The Asian Openbill gets its name from a distinctive gap in the dull grayish yellow bill. Note the pinkish legs. Asian Openbills inhabit wetland habitats including shallow marshes, flooded agricultural fields, and lakes. From a distance they could be confused with herons, but they can be clearly distinguished from herons by their feeding habits—wading slowly through shallow water. Soars frequently, often in large dense flocks; note extended neck, unlike retracted neck of herons and egrets."
0,Asian Palm-Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Cypsiurus balasiensis,https://ebird.org/species/aspswi1,"A small gray-brown swift with long thin wings and a long heavily-forked tail.

The song is variable, but most often is a burbling series of sweet notes given in three parts, with the middle part higher pitched. The call is a single loud sweet chip."
0,Barking Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox connivens,https://ebird.org/species/barowl1,Medium sized gray-brown owl with white underparts heavily streaked brown. Favors edge habitats and often roosts near creeks in woodlands. Feeds on small to medium sized mammals. Known for its diagnostic ‘woof-woof’ call which sounds like a dog barking.
0,Barlow's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Calendulauda barlowi,https://ebird.org/species/barlar1,"A medium-sized lark that has a rounded head lacking a crest, a slightly decurved bill, a bold face pattern, and a heavily streaked breast with unstreaked flanks. Upperparts coloration is mostly sandy-brown to tan, often matching prevailing soil color in the region. Pairs are resident in soft sands of semi-arid Karoo and coastal shrublands, preferring to dig in sandy areas for insects. The male sings from bushes, and in spring has a protracted aerial display 10 to 30 meters up in the air, with deep wingbeats, fluttering, and dangling legs. The song is a distinctive set of introductory clicks followed by a short, downslurred scratchy musical phrase that may or may not end in a semi-musical trill. The slightly smaller and more boldly marked Karoo Lark has streaking extending to the flanks that is lacking on Barlow’s Lark."
0,Barn Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Hirundo rustica,https://ebird.org/species/barswa,"A fairly large, colorful swallow. Usually easy to identify with its long, forked tail and dark rump. Iridescent navy-blue above with a rich orange throat and forehead. Underparts vary across range, from bright buffy-orange to whitish. Occurs in any open habitat, especially large fields and wetlands. Often seen foraging in flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of swallow. Typically nests close to human habitation; builds a muddy cup nest in a barn or under a dock. Listen for dry, scratchy “svit svit” calls. Note head and breast pattern and tail length to help separate from various similar species in Asia and Australia (e.g., Welcome Swallow, Hill Swallow, Pacific Swallow)."
0,Barnacle Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Branta leucopsis,https://ebird.org/species/bargoo,"Handsome and distinctive. A rather compact and fairly small goose with big white face patch, silvery upperparts, and black neck and breast sharply demarcated from white belly. Breeds mainly in Greenland, Iceland, and Spitsbergen, and locally around the Baltic Sea. Winters in farmland and grassy wetlands mainly in coastal lowlands throughout northern Europe. Free flying feral birds resident locally at lakes and parks in the U.K. In main wintering areas, occurs in hundreds or even thousands; elsewhere, singles and family groups can be found among flocks of other geese. Rare but increasing visitor to northeastern North America, almost always with flocks of Canada Geese."
0,Barolo Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus baroli,https://ebird.org/species/litshe1,"Scarce and poorly known seabird breeding locally on islands of Azores, Madeira, and Canaries; very rarely seen at sea, usually as single birds, often not with other seabirds. Small, stiff-winged seabird that flies fast and low over the water (almost like an auk), gliding mainly in windy conditions. Note white-faced appearance, extensively white underparts contrasting with blackish upperparts. Trailing edge of upperwings often has a frosty sheen. Appreciably smaller and quicker on the wing than much commoner Manx Shearwater."
0,Barratt's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus barratti,https://ebird.org/species/afswar1,"A skulky, dull brown warbler with a long and graduated tail, a pale grayish eyebrow, and a throat that is lightly streaked. It creeps around mouse-like in thick undergrowth and tangles in forest and forest edge. It is also found in isolated pockets of scrub, often adjacent to streams, and is frequently detected and identified by its song, mostly delivered between September and December: 2-3 sweet “tsiit” notes followed by a loud trill of 15-20 harsh “tchui” notes. It also has a strident chipping alarm call “tddd-ddr-ddr-ddr-ddr-tt.” The similar Knysna Warbler differs from Barratt’s Warbler by its shorter tail, darker underparts, less pronounced throat streaking, and different song."
0,Barred Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus doliatus,https://ebird.org/species/barant1,"A retiring bird of thickets, forest edge, and other tangled vegetation. Distinctive song is heard regularly and pairs are usually within earshot of each other, but antshrikes generally remain hidden. The sexes look very different, but both have a spiky crest that is often raised. Male is barred black-and-white in ‘convict stripes,’ whereas female looks a lot like a wren with a stout bill that has a slightly hooked tip."
0,Barred Antthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Formicariidae,Chamaeza mollissima,https://ebird.org/species/barant2,"Compact brown bird with a stubby black bill. Warm reddish brown with heavy black-and-white barring on the undersides, face, and eyebrow. Walks around the ground in dense montane forest with a springy gait, bobbing its tail up and down with each slow step. Exceptionally timid bird heard far more often than seen; listen for its long hooting song, an accelerating series of low toots."
0,Barred Becard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Pachyramphus versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/barbec1,"Becards are reminiscent of flycatchers but in a different family; they are medium sized and have a rather flat head. Barred is small for a becard; males have a distinctive yellow face, black cap and back, and thin barring on the underparts. Females have a gray cap, rufous wings, and more even yellow underparts. Singles or pairs are found in forested areas, including edges and second growth. Not usually super high in the trees."
0,Barred Buttonquail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Turnicidae,Turnix suscitator,https://ebird.org/species/barbut1,"Tiny rotund, short-tailed bird, scarcely larger than a sparrow; like a diminutive partridge or quail but only distantly related. Brown with scaly streaking above, extensive black barring on the chest (more extensive on the female), and rich tawny flanks. Extremely difficult to detect, moving about invisibly in dense weedy vegetation in fields, forest edges, and farmland. Flying birds have whirring flight, show contrast between dark flight feathers and paler coverts. Courting females give sonorous, booming calls from dense vegetation."
0,Barred Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina lineata,https://ebird.org/species/yeecus1,"Medium-sized slender bird with a short, pointed bill and bold yellow eye. Slaty gray except for white lower belly and undertail with fine gray barring. Usually seen high up in fruiting trees (often fig trees). Inhabits rainforest in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and tropical and subtropical east coast of Australia."
0,Barred Cuckoo-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Macropygia unchall,https://ebird.org/species/bacdov1,"Shy brown dove of forests with dense understory. Wings and tail are dark brown, and the rest of the body is closer to tan. Males are boldly barred on the chest, and both sexes have a bronzy-green tinge to the nape. Seldom seen out in the open, this species is quick to flee when approached, flying strongly and quickly through dense vegetation. Appears longer-tailed than Spotted Dove and Turtle Dove, both when in flight and on the ground."
0,Barred Forest-Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Micrastur ruficollis,https://ebird.org/species/baffal1,"Retiring and rarely seen raptor of humid forest in lowlands and foothills. Usually detected by sharp, barking call given mainly early and late in the day. Does not soar. Most likely encountered sitting quietly at middle to low levels inside the forest. Adult has orange-yellow facial skin and pale eyes. Immature is creamy below, often with some dark barring. Note the long yellow legs."
0,Barred Fruiteater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Pipreola arcuata,https://ebird.org/species/barfru1,"Chunky, short-tailed, flat-headed bird patterned in green and black. Male has black head and breast, pale yellow belly with bold dark barring, and mossy green upperparts with bold pale spotting on the wing. Female is similar but has a green head with barring all the way up the throat. On both sexes, note red bill and legs and pale eye varying from orange to gray to whitish. Fairly common in stunted forested habitats in the upper subtropical and temperate zone in the Andes. Sluggish; perches quietly in the middle levels of the forest, sometimes following a mixed-species flock. May be seen singly or in pairs, but several can gather around a fruiting tree. Listen for super high-pitched calls."
0,Barred Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Morphnarchus princeps,https://ebird.org/species/barhaw1,"This montane raptor has very broad wings and a disproportionately short tail. The black hood is a good mark that stands out at a distance, but the namesake bars on the belly are thin and indistinct. Sexes similar. More often seen flying over forest rather than perched. Often quite vocal; listen for the far-carrying descending whistles, usually repeated."
0,Barred Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Ianthocincla lunulata,https://ebird.org/species/barlau1,"Pale brown laughingthrush with a pale face, black barring on the back, and a blue-gray wing panel. Handsome but shy and inconspicuous, foraging quietly on the ground and in shrubbery and thickets. Very similar in appearance to the rarer, more range-restricted, and dark-throated White-necklaced Laughingthrush. Note Barred’s pale, relatively unmarked throat."
0,Barred Owlet-nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Aegothelidae,Aegotheles bennettii,https://ebird.org/species/barown1,"A common, medium-sized owlet-nightjar of lowland and foothill forests. Dark gray with fine barring over the whole body. A black central crown stripe, black eyebrows reaching the back of the neck and a pale collar. The similar Australian Owlet-Nightjar co-occurs, but Barred Owlet-Nightjar is darker and lacks the pale cheek. Voice, a short, raspy, falling “kiyo!” or low “wak!” repeated several times."
0,Barred Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Bolborhynchus lineola,https://ebird.org/species/barpar1,"Small, fast-flying parakeet of humid evergreen forest in foothills and highlands, especially in areas with seeding bamboo. Usually seen in pairs or small groups flying high overhead; rarely seen perched. Note pointed tail, fast and slightly bounding flight, and habitat (no other small parakeets occur in highlands of Mexico and northern Central America). Blackish barring on upperparts only apparent with a good view."
0,Barred Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Nystalus radiatus,https://ebird.org/species/barpuf1,"An unobtrusive bird with an oversized head and bill. Look for tiger-striped pattern—warm cinnamon-brown overall with uneven black barring. Also note slightly darker cap and staring pale eye. Uncommon; found around forest edge and secondary woodland in the lowlands from Panama to western Ecuador. Perches still for long periods of time, often on an exposed perch. Frequently detected by distinctive wolf-whistling calls."
0,Barred Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus torquatus,https://ebird.org/species/barrai1,"A strikingly marked rail with a short cocked tail. Olive-brown above and heavily barred black-and-white below and on throat, with a rufous band across the chest. Face is strikingly black with a thick white stripe. Favors damp marshy grassland up to 1000 meters of elevation. Similar to Buff-banded Rail, but easily identified by its white facial stripe and lack of a white eyebrow. Often heard giving a loud, harsh croaking chorus."
0,Barred Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Crypturellus casiquiare,https://ebird.org/species/bartin1,"Very rare and poorly known tinamou of remote lowland rainforest. Existing records suggest that it favors areas with sandy soil. Rather small for a tinamou, with a chestnut head, a black back, wings marked with rusty bars, dingy underparts, and a pale throat. Few birders have ever seen it, and even hearing one requires some luck. Song is a series of whistles that starts out by accelerating and rising slightly in pitch, then slows down and falls towards the end."
0,Barred Wren-Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Calamonastes fasciolatus,https://ebird.org/species/bawwar1,"Long-tailed brownish warbler. In all plumages, shows heavy barring below, but this barring is obscured by a brown band across the breast of breeding males. Generally uncommon in arid, thorny savanna. Often raises its tail in wren-like fashion. Normal song is a vibrating, metallic note that is frequently repeated. Another vocalization is a repeated two-part “gid-yup.” Similar to Miombo Wren-Warbler, but has little overlap in range and separated by dusky underparts and darker eye."
0,Barrow's Goldeneye,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Bucephala islandica,https://ebird.org/species/bargol,"Striking diving duck of coastal harbors, mountain lakes, and large rivers. Very similar to Common Goldeneye. Males are easiest: Barrow’s has more black on the back, a downward-pointing spur on the side, and a crescent-shaped (not circular) white patch on the face. Females can be very difficult. Barrow’s usually has a yellow bill, but Common can rarely show a dull yellowish bill. Head and bill shape are important: Barrow’s has a steeper forehead and a puffy nape, and a shorter bill with a more rounded lower edge. Fairly common in western U.S. and Canada; much less common in the northeast. Small population in Iceland. Frequently found in mixed flocks with Common Goldeneye."
0,Bartlett's Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Crypturellus bartletti,https://ebird.org/species/bartin2,"Small tinamou of floodplain rainforest. Reddish brown with limited black barring on the wings. Found in tall lowland rainforest, especially around water and in seasonally flooded areas, and can be quite common. Listen for a series of whistles given at a pace of about one note per four seconds that gradually accelerates until about twice as fast; recalls the song of Cinereous Tinamou, but faster and usually accelerating."
0,Basra Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus griseldis,https://ebird.org/species/barwar2,"Medium-sized Acrocephalus warbler with cold gray-olive-brown plumage and whitish underparts. Note the long and slender bill and the short eyebrow that reaches just behind eye. Distinctly larger that Eurasian Reed Warbler and smaller than Great Reed Warbler. Breed in extensive reedbeds. Call a harsh ""charr."" Song is rather quiet and slow mixed with deep, bulbul-like notes."
0,Bassian Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera lunulata,https://ebird.org/species/oltthr1,"Large thrush, greenish brown with black scallop marks above, pale with black scaly marks below. Smaller Russet-tailed Thrush has larger-appearing bill, is less strongly marked above. Bassian lacks white in tail corners, usually visible in flying or preening Russet-tailed. The smaller wingbar has less prominent pale tips in adult Bassian. Introduced Song Thrush has spots rather than scaly marks below. Inhabits wet forests, where it forages in leaf litter. Song recalls that of Common Blackbird, very different from Russet-tailed song."
0,Bat Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco rufigularis,https://ebird.org/species/batfal1,"Dashing small falcon of tropical lowlands and foothills. Prefers forest edge, adjacent semi-open areas with tall trees, buildings. Found at several Maya ruins in Mexico and northern Central America, also locally in towns. Looks dark overall with a contrasting white throat, and in flight can be confused with White-collared Swift. With a good view, note the rusty belly and ‘trousers.’ Hunts bats at dusk, but main food is small birds caught in flight."
0,Bat Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Macheiramphus alcinus,https://ebird.org/species/bathaw1,"An acrobatic, swift-like raptor with angular wings and a massive gape; capable of snatching prey from the air and devouring it in a flash while still on the wing. Dark with varying amounts of white on the underside; African birds have patchy white throughout the underparts, while white is restricted to the throat and lower belly on New Guinean birds and solely to the throat in Southeast Asian birds. Inactive during the day; hunts at dawn and dusk, and occasionally into the night if light is sufficient. Generally uncommon and localized, most reliably encountered near large bat roosts in forested areas, but can also be seen over open forest, fields, and fringes of habitation."
0,Bateleur,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Terathopius ecaudatus,https://ebird.org/species/batele1,"A very distinctive, short-tailed eagle. Young birds are uniformly dark brown, and adults are mostly black with a bright red face and legs. Sexes differ, especially in flight, and can be told by the width of the black band on the back edge of the white underwing: narrow in females, broad in males. It flies low when foraging, with wings lifted above the body and rocking from left to right in an unstable-looking fashion. Bateleurs hunt small animals and eat carrion, and they are often first the first raptors to arrive at a carcass."
0,Bates's Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgus batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batnig2,"Large, dark, long-tailed forest nightjar. Males have small white patches in the outer wings and at the corners of the tail; females have all-dark wings and can show small buff tail corners. Found in lowland rainforest, including forest edge and clearings. The distinctive vocalization is usually given from a tree: a single barking “kow,” followed after a pause by a quick series of several similar notes. Found in the same habitat as Brown Nightjar, but larger and longer-tailed; males further distinguished by the pale patches in the wing and tail."
0,Bates's Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batpaf1,"Both sexes show a dark gray head and underparts with a rufous back, tail, and undertail. Tail is usually short, but males in the southwest part of the range can sport very long central tail feathers. Both sexes have a blue bill and ring around the eye. Found in lowland rainforest and swamp forest. A restless, active bird of middle levels of the forest. Similar to Rufous-vented Paradise-Flycatcher, but has a paler gray head without a crest, and usually has a shorter tail. Can be similar to African Paradise-Flycatcher, but distinguished by the rufous undertail and lack of a crest. Call is a series of tearing “shreet” notes, and song is a fast, bubbling series of “twee” notes."
0,Bates's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batsun2,"A very small nondescript sunbird with a short orange-based bill that curves uniformly along its length; easily mistaken for females of other sunbirds. The only features on the olive upperparts are indistinct paler eyebrows and lines running under the eyes, and yellow edging to the wings. Although often hidden, the male has yellow or whitish (not red) tufts at the shoulders. Singles are local and inconspicuous at the edges of lowland and riverine forest, sometimes entering secondary growth; it joins mixed-flocks and is frequently attracted to epiphytes in mossy clumps. Calls a high-pitched “tseeep” and trills. Little Green and Fraser’s sunbirds are similar to Bates’s but brighter, with straighter bills and more distinct yellowish eye-rings; Ursula’s Sunbird has a long decurved bill and grayish face and underparts."
0,Bates's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batswi1,"A small, entirely blackish swift with a slightly dusky throat and a deeply forked tail. Flies rapidly over lowland forest, occasionally gliding briefly. Most often found over lowland forests, where it nests in abandoned swallow nests such as those of Forest Swallow. In profile, similar to African Palm-Swift or Scarce Swift, but Bates’s Swift has wider wings and a bigger body, and is overall much darker."
0,Bates's Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus batesi,https://ebird.org/species/batwea1,"A weaver with a plain olive back and yellow underparts and different-looking sexes: the male has a chestnut head and face and a small black throat patch, while the female has a black hood reaching below the eyes and a yellow throat. Juvenile is like the female, but the hood is duller. Rare and restricted to southern Cameroon, where it remains poorly known from lowland rainforest. Vocalizations are undescribed."
0,Baudin's Black-Cockatoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Cacatuidae,Calyptorhynchus baudinii,https://ebird.org/species/whtblc1,"Black cockatoo with white ear patch and white tail panel. Inhabits moist eucalypt forest in the southwestern corner of Western Australia, where it eats seeds from large seed pods of Marri and Karri trees. Unlikely to be observed out on the coastal sand plains of Perth. Very similar to Carnaby’s Black-Cockatoo but with much longer, pointed upper mandible. Calls include mournful wailing cries that are more clipped than those of Carnaby’s."
0,Baudo Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope ortoni,https://ebird.org/species/baugua1,"Medium-sized turkeylike bird restricted to very wet rainforest in lowlands and foothills of western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. It is dark brown with white streaks on the underparts and a red dewlap. Similar to the more common Crested Guan, but is smaller, browner (lacking chestnut on the belly and tail), and shows little or no crest. Baudo Guan is usually found in small groups high in the trees, and is very sensitive to habitat alteration; it is rarely encountered away from remote, relatively undisturbed areas."
0,Bay Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria capitalis,https://ebird.org/species/bayant1,"Dark antpitta found in cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes in central Peru. Much of its range is remote and rarely visited by birders. Adult is similar to both Chestnut Antpitta and Rufous Antpitta, but note the larger size, gray crown, thin eye-ring, unbarred belly patch, and voice. The rarely-seen juvenile is even darker with buff and gray barring and a spotted crown. Inhabits forest understory, especially where there is abundant bamboo. Stays on the ground when not singing and usually very tough to see. Song is a quick series that consists of a short note followed by two to five slightly lower notes."
0,Bay Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus celebensis,https://ebird.org/species/baycou1,"A reddish-brown cuckoo with a long, often shaggy-looking tail. Juvenile shows a pale eye and a paler breast and throat than adults. The species favors vine tangles within forest and forest edge in lowlands and foothills, where it is usually encountered singly or in pairs. The entirely brown body, lacking black, separates this species from Lesser Coucal. Song is a series of “hoot” notes that often encourages other nearby coucals to respond. Alarm call is a harsh, short rasping “burr.”"
0,Bay Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Blythipicus pyrrhotis,https://ebird.org/species/baywoo1,"A medium-sized woodpecker of dense forests, often encountered only through its song, which sounds like maniacal descending laughter; also gives a loud, high-pitched grating chatter. Bright rufous overall, with black banding on the wings and tail, a paler brown head, and a long, bright yellow bill. Only the male has a red patch on the back of the head. May appear dark brown from a distance or when shaded, but often flashes bright orange when in flight. Drums infrequently, if at all."
0,Bay Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cantorchilus nigricapillus,https://ebird.org/species/baywre1,"Medium-sized wren; strikingly patterned if seen well. Rufous above with complex black-and-white face markings; clean white throat. Some populations have clean rufous flanks, others barred black-and-white. Black cap and nape give it a hooded appearance. Often stays hidden in tangles and thickets at forest edge or second growth, often near water. Difficult to get a clear look at. Listen for loud, ringing song, often given as a duet."
0,Baya Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus philippinus,https://ebird.org/species/baywea1,"A widespread weaver that is known for its nest—a long hanging nest with a bulbous chamber and a narrow tubular entrance. Breeding males have yellow forehead and crown, a dark throat that contrasts with yellow underparts. Nonbreeding males and females are similar except they have buffy colors where breeding males are yellow; also note the dark streaks on the back and the broad buffy eyebrow on females. Juvenile resembles female, but lack the female’s obvious eyebrow. Baya Weavers lack the strongly streaked appearance of Streaked Weavers. Regional variation in plumage exist mainly in the amount of yellow and black in breeding plumage. Occur as flocks, particularly in breeding season. Advertising calls of males are an easy way to detect the species as several males in the flock call together creating a cacophony of a series of rasping chatters followed by a buzzing whistle interspersed with long chatters."
0,Beach Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Todiramphus saurophagus,https://ebird.org/species/beakin2,"A large coastal kingfisher with a gleaming white head, a thin black line behind the eye, and a blue-green back. Juvenile duller, with buff on crown and underside. Found singly or in pairs in mangroves, on beaches, and along rocky shorelines, where it often perches on exposed rocks or in trees bordering coast. Clean white crown and narrow (not wide) black strip behind eye distinguish it from all forms of the smaller Collared Kingfisher. Vocal, giving harsh calls: a “choo-chew” descending on the second note and a rapid, agitated “kip-kip-kip-kip-kip.”"
0,Bearded Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Lybiidae,Lybius dubius,https://ebird.org/species/beabar1,"Large, colorful barbet with a huge ivory-colored bill. Note the red underparts with a thick black bar across the middle. Found in a variety of habitats, including moist and dry savanna, woodland, gardens, and secondary growth, often in the vicinity of figs and other fruiting trees. Most often in pairs or small groups. The call is a very rough, explosive “rwauk,” often given in a slow series. Similar to Double-toothed Barbet, but separated by the black chest band and the lack of a red bar on the shoulder."
0,Bearded Bellbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Procnias averano,https://ebird.org/species/beabel1,"Famously loud and distinctive-looking, this large cotinga is one of the iconic species of northern South America. Male is unmistakable with mostly white body, black wings, brown head, and throat full of dangling black wattles that look like the bird threw up a plateful of worms onto itself. Female is much plainer, greenish with faint yellow streaks on the underparts. Female is extremely similar to female White Bellbird; where range overlaps with White Bellbird, Bearded typically occurs at higher elevations. Most often found by the extremely loud and far-carrying “bonk!” call given by the male."
0,Bearded Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope barbata,https://ebird.org/species/beagua1,"Large chickenlike bird with a long tail. Chocolate-brown overall with pinkish-red legs and silvery frosting on head and neck. Restricted to southern Ecuador and northwestern Peru, where it occurs in subtropical and temperate forest from around 2,000 to 3,000 m. Typically in pairs or small groups in the mid levels of forest. Replaces Andean Guan south of Cuenca and west of Jaén; also note subtle differences in patterning: Bearded has more extensive silver on brow and a streaked, not scaled, breast."
0,Bearded Mountaineer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Oreonympha nobilis,https://ebird.org/species/beamou1,"Fairly large hummingbird with a striking facial pattern and a long tail. Brown above, white below, with a brown head and black-and-white forked tail. Males have an iridescent green and purple gorget, and in some populations a blue forehead; females are similar but duller. Found in dry mountain scrub at high elevations."
0,Bearded Reedling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Panuridae,Panurus biarmicus,https://ebird.org/species/bearee1,"Fairly common but local in extensive reed beds. Not easy to see well but sometimes feeds at edges, often very low or on adjacent muddy ground. Flight typically low over reeds with whirring wingbeats. Often in small groups. No other species looks very similar, particularly given habitat and behavior: note bright cinnamon-brown plumage, long tail, and yellowish bill; male has blue-gray head and broad black mustaches."
0,Bearded Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops barbarus,https://ebird.org/species/besowl,"Small, yellow-eyed owl of humid pine-oak forest in the highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala. Plumage much like other screech-owls, but ear tufts are very short and often not noticeable. It has relatively distinct whitish eyebrows and the dark marks on the underparts are somewhat scalloped rather than streaked. Song is a purring trill, which could be passed off as coming from a frog or insect. Favors denser and more humid areas than Whiskered Screech-Owl."
0,Bearded Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cercotrichas quadrivirgata,https://ebird.org/species/besrob1,"Pretty robin with a brown back, boldly marked face, and unstreaked rufous chest. Found in broadleaved woodland, moist savanna, and thickets. Shy bird that generally skulks in thick undergrowth. Song is a variable, musical series of whistles. Certain two-noted phrases can be repeated many times. Similar to Red-backed Scrub-Robin, but lacks white wings bars, and shows a rufous breast without streaks."
0,Bearded Tachuri,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Polystictus pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/beatac1,A small attractive flycatcher. Males have a striking face pattern with a black crown hiding concealed white feathers and a black face that contrasts with its brown back. Note the rusty rump and cinnamon wash below.

0,Blackpoll Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga striata,https://ebird.org/species/bkpwar,"Relatively large warbler of the boreal forest. Breeding males have solid black cap and white cheek; compare with Black-and-white Warbler. Breeding females are a washed out, streakier version of male. Immatures in fall are quite different: lemony-yellow head and breast with blurry streaking, white wingbars, and white undertail coverts. Distinctive orange feet help distinguish Blackpoll from similar immature Bay-breasted and Pine Warblers. Breeds in coniferous forest, especially stunted spruces at higher elevations. Found in any forested habitat during migration. Known for its exceptional fall migration over the Atlantic Ocean; can travel from East Coast of U.S. to South America in one nonstop flight!"

0,Blue Coua,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coua caerulea,https://ebird.org/species/blucou1,"Big, dark, long-tailed tree-dwelling bird. Like other couas, inquisitive and restless. Generally prefers to jump or flop through the trees, but sometimes makes long gliding flights with occasional explosive wingbeats. Found in eastern and northern rainforest. Most common call is a short, explosive “brr-dd-t”. Also gives a long, descending series of mournful “kwa” notes. Larger than Red-fronted and Red-breasted Couas, lacking red coloration, and is usually found high in trees, unlike those understory-dwelling species."
0,Blue Crane,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Anthropoides paradiseus,https://ebird.org/species/blucra2,"A small, elegant, uniformly blue-gray crane that dwells in open habitats in pairs and variably sized groups. The bulbous head, plain face lacking any naked skin, and lack of contrast in the wings are distinctive. It is a resident and partial nomad in semi-desert, grassland, and cereal cropland. A staccato, bugling “kkk-kk-kk-kk-krraaak” call often first gives them away."
0,Blue Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Cyanograucalus azureus,https://ebird.org/species/blucus1,"A beautiful, entirely blue thrush-like bird that can be surprisingly hard to make out in the dark subcanopy of tropical forests as it forages high above the ground. When seen well, it is unmistakable, with its entirely blue body, red eyes, dark face, and black bill. When it is backlit in the trees, look for its distinctive profile perched close to branches with relatively short legs and tail, and its generally unicolored appearance. Occurs in small flocks whose calls consist of hoarse, whiny “tchuwee” and terse “tchup” notes. Song is a piercing “puuuEEEEoooo” or “wheeEEEr” that can be fairly variable in pitch and length."
0,Blue Dacnis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Dacnis cayana,https://ebird.org/species/bludac1,"Small active warblerlike tanager with sharply pointed bill.

Uniformly slate-blue duck with chestnut spotting on the breast. Bill is pale pink with a black tip. Males larger than females, with more breast spotting and more prominent green iridescence on the head, neck, and back. Found on clear, fast-flowing mountain streams. The Maori name, whio, is derived from the male’s high-pitched, wheezy whistle. Female’s call is a low rasping growl, often in response to disturbance. Readily distinguished from Pacific Black Duck or Mallard by uniform coloration and, if on the water, prominent tail tilted upward and head held erect."
0,Blue Eared-Pheasant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Crossoptilon auritum,https://ebird.org/species/blephe1,"A large gray terrestrial bird with an elegantly frilly tail. Bright red face and upswept white facial plumes (“ears”) are unique in its range. Found in both subalpine and alpine areas, preferring open forests in the former and scrubby meadows in the latter. Forages in small groups for most of the year, pairing off during the breeding season. Hunted in much of its range, thus wary and found in remote areas, far from settlements."
0,Blue Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Rhopospina caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/blufin1,"Slim finch with a long bill. Males are unmistakable, with indigo-blue plumage and yellow bill. Females are buff brown above and heavily streaked below; bill yellowish, with dusky upper edge.

0,Blue Ground Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Claravis pretiosa,https://ebird.org/species/blgdov1,"Attractive small dove of humid forest edges and clearings in tropical lowlands; in some places wanders into small rural villages. Typically rather wary, and most often seen in fast, rather direct flight, as singles or pairs. Powder-blue male is striking and distinctive. Female is most easily identified when with the male. On lone females, note the rusty rump and rather long rusty tail."
0,Blue Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Cyanocitta cristata,https://ebird.org/species/blujay,"Familiar but stunning jay found year-round throughout most of eastern North America. Bright blue above and pale gray below with a fluffy crest. Also look for black necklace and black and white markings on the wings and tail. Pairs or small groups travel through mature deciduous or coniferous woodlands, often revealing their presence with loud, harsh “jay” calls. Frequently visits bird feeders, where it is often aggressive towards other birds."
0,Blue Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Vini peruviana,https://ebird.org/species/blulor1,"A unique and distinctive lorikeet, almost entirely a deep royal blue with a bright orange bill and feet and an extensive pure white throat, cheek, and chest patch. Inhabits any forest, but appears to favor coconut and banana plantations. Unique within its range. Common call is a trisyllabic “tse-tee-teet.”"
0,Blue Malkoha,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Ceuthmochares aereus,https://ebird.org/species/yellow5,"Odd, dark blue-and-gray cuckoo with a bright yellow bill. Found in thick habitats including forest, forest edge, and thickets. Skulks in the thickest parts of the mid-story, especially preferring vine tangles.

Range does not overlap with the similar Green Malkoha."
0,Blue-backed Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Chiroxiphia pareola,https://ebird.org/species/blbman1,"Small bird of riverine and gallery forests in both forest and savanna regions; generally inconspicuous when not displaying. Adult male is distinctive with black body, sky-blue back, and red or yellow crown patch; both sexes have orange legs. Female is similar to White-bearded Manakin, but has somewhat slimmer shape and longer tail. Inhabits forest understory but may ascend to canopy, especially when displaying. Feeds on fruit like other manakins and may be seen at fruiting shrubs and trees. Often detected by loud, single call note; males produce a variety of bizarre sounds in coordinated group display."
0,Blue Mockingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Melanotis caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/blumoc,"Not closely related to Northern Mockingbird. Skulking and heard far more often than seen, this fairly large and ample-tailed songbird might be better named ""denim catbird"" for its overall dull blue plumage, mewing calls, and retiring behavior. Favors thickets, dense scrubby woodlands, and forest understory in foothills and highlands; locally to western lowlands in winter. Tosses leaves on the ground and also feeds at all levels in dense fruiting bushes and trees. Most often seen in short flights across roads or trails from cover to cover. Voice notably varied."
0,Blue-gray Noddy,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Anous ceruleus,https://ebird.org/species/bugnod,"A very small, pale gray tern with large dark eyes. Smaller and paler gray than Brown and Black Noddies with slightly more of a forked tail. Nests on rocky sea cliffs on tropical islands, typically foraging close to shore, fluttering close to the water and plucking food from the surface in small flocks. Voice is a distinctive nasal “kearr.”"
0,Blue Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta azurea,https://ebird.org/species/blunut1,"Not the only blue nuthatch, but the bluest nuthatch. Unmistakable, with a dark head, pale eyering, white throat and breast, and dark-lined pale blue feathers on the wings. Gives quick, sharp, nasal “tzwp” or “tzwit” notes. Clambers up and down tree trunks, often in small parties; frequent member of mixed-species foraging flocks. Favors montane and hilly forests."
0,Blue Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone cyanescens,https://ebird.org/species/blpfly1,"A medium-sized, long-tailed bird of lowland forest understory on Palawan and neighboring islands. Has a blue bill, eye-ring, chest, and head with a slight crest at the back. Back, wings, and tail are blue in the male and rufous in the female. Female is distinctive. Male is similar to Black-naped Monarch, but larger, and lacks the black mark on the back of the head. Song consists of a rapidly pulsating series of fairly high-pitched nasal notes that increase in volume."
0,Blue Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Halobaena caerulea,https://ebird.org/species/blupet1,"Rather small, attractively patterned petrel of cold subantarctic waters; not seen from mainland. Sometimes accompanies ships, especially near breeding islands and with groups of similar-sized and superficially similar prions. Blue Petrel told from all prion species by dark cap, half collar, and bold white tail tip. Also note differences in flight pattern; often a bit stronger and banks higher in strong winds."
0,Blue Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Hydrornis cyaneus,https://ebird.org/species/blupit1,"Only the male of this rotund ground-dweller is truly blue; the female only has a hint of blue on the rump and tail. Male is brilliant and eye-catching if seen well: sky-blue on the back with a polka-dotted light blue breast and belly. Female has gray-brown wings and finely barred white underparts. Both sexes boast a pale face and a thin black eyebrow, above which flames a lava-red crown (darker in males than in females). Forages on the densely-vegetated floor of forests from the lowlands up into montane regions, often in gorges, in ravines, and near streams. Song is a liquid ‘cho’mew-wit!’, with a clipped-sounding last note."
0,Blue Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Synoicus adansonii,https://ebird.org/species/bluqua1,"Tiny, dark grassland quail. Males are dark blue and chestnut, with a bright white throat. Females are dark brown with heavy barring below. Found in moist grasslands, often in seasonally flooded areas. Probably nomadic or migratory, appearing with the onset of the rainy season. The common vocalization is a two- or three-part whistled call: “chee-chew” or “chee-chee-chew.” Smaller than other quail; male separated by blue coloration and female by barring below."
0,Blue Rock-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Monticola solitarius,https://ebird.org/species/burthr,"Medium-sized thrush-like bird, often seen on mountainsides, sea cliffs, quarries, ruins, and even towns. Males usually unmistakable: western birds are dark blue all over, but may appear all dark at a distance; eastern birds are blue with orange underparts. Females dark brown above, finely barred below. Long bill, wings, and tail make for a distinctive and very different shape than Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush. Song is melodic and blackbird-like."
0,Blue-and-white Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Pygochelidon cyanoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/bawswa1,"One of the most common and widespread Neotropical swallows.

Dark purple with tiny silvery spots on head, back, and wings. Bill color varies with range: dark in central and eastern China and parts of mainland Southeast Asia, bright yellow in populations elsewhere. Frequently fans tail while standing on an exposed perch such as a waterside rock or overhanging branch. True to its name, it does whistle: a long piercing note that carries well over the sound of rushing water."
0,Bluethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Luscinia svecica,https://ebird.org/species/blueth,"Beautiful thrush-like bird that tends to stay hidden. Dull gray above, but a head-on view reveals a stunning pattern of electric blue and orange on the throat (some variation in pattern across range). Females show fainter colors than males, sometimes lacking blue entirely, but are still very boldly patterned. On the dullest young females, look for bold white eyebrow and throat, necklace of dark streaks, and rufous on the base of the tail. Variable song includes imitations of other species among a jumble of trills, whistles, and chirps. Typically found in scrubby, brushy habitat, often in edge areas: reedbeds, overgrown fields, and thickets. Usually skulky but singing males can perch conspicuously atop a bush. Breeds across Europe and Asia into Alaska; winters from northern Africa to southeast Asia."

Dark reddish eye. Could be confused with Masked Flowerpiercer but duller overall without large black mask. Bill is less upswept than most flowerpiercers. Found singly or in pairs, often following a mixed-species flock through the forest canopy. Occurs from around 1,600-2,700m."
0,Blyth's Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus affinis,https://ebird.org/species/javfro2,"Cryptic, uncommon nightbird of lowland and lower foothill forests (to 800 meters). Males show extensive barring on wings, whitish lower belly, and irregular white blotches on the breast. Females are warmer brown, almost rufous, with less wing barring and a wide “necklace” of white blotches on the breast. The only frogmouth in much of its western range. Vocalizations vary; male gives a series of rippling clear whistles and both sexes give harsh nasal croaks."
0,Blyth's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Rhyticeros plicatus,https://ebird.org/species/blyhor1,"A huge, spectacular hornbill of lowland and foothill forest. All black body and white tail. Blue skin on the pouch below the bill and around the eye. Male is much larger with a rufous head and chest, whereas the female has a black head. A large, ivory-colored bill with a rippled casque on top. Presence often betrayed by loud wingbeats overhead. Forages in the canopy for fruit and sometimes, small animal prey. Unmistakable. The only hornbill in its range. Voice, far-carrying, gruff barks, or grunts “gew! gew! gew!”."
0,Blyth's Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Alcedo hercules,https://ebird.org/species/blykin1,"Medium-sized kingfisher of shaded mountain streams in mature hill forest. Like a larger version of Common Kingfisher, but much darker and with no orange behind the ear. Bill is heavy and all-dark; its length and girth give the bird a heavy-headed appearance. Perches low over the water on boulders and low-hanging branches, from which it gives a hoarse, rasping call."
0,Blyth's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus reguloides,https://ebird.org/species/blylew1,"Fairly bright mid-sized leaf-warbler, yellowish-green above and white below with two wingbars, a broad yellow-suffused eyebrow, and a pale stripe across a gray crown. Amount of white in the tail is intermediate between White-tailed Leaf-Warbler and Emei Leaf-Warbler. A brighter crown stripe separates Blyth’s from the Emei, and unique behavior serves to distinguish this species from White-tailed: Blyth’s constantly flicks wings one after the other, while White-tailed flicks them simultaneously. Kloss’s Leaf-Warbler is much brighter overall, especially on the head and vent. Hartert’s and Claudia’s Leaf-Warblers are closely related, physically similar, and may pose issues in areas of overlap: look out for a more yellowish breast on Hartert’s and a whiter eyebrow and less white in the tail in Claudia’s. Blyth’s song is a high “tsi-tsslehlee-tsslehlee” or “tsi-tchew-witty-tchew-witty-tchew,” with the introductory note separating it from Hartert’s but not always Claudia’s. Breeds in broadleaf (often oak), coniferous, or mixed forests at middle to high elevations, and descends into lower foothill regions in the winter."
0,Blyth's Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone affinis,https://ebird.org/species/blypaf1,"Breeding males trail long streamers which are almost double the length of the body. Male comes in rufous and white morphs; both morphs have dark head, weak triangular crest, and blue eyering. Females resemble a non-breeding rufous male, but with a duller blue eyering and slightly paler head. Extremely similar to Amur Paradise-Flycatcher, but has a glossier black head with a clearer demarcation between the black and gray. Female is similar to female Japanese Paradise-Flycatcher, but with a much paler gray breast which fades more gradually (as opposed to sharper cutoff between gray breast and white belly of Japanese). Inhabits evergreen broadleaf forest and forest edge, including secondary growth, gardens, and plantations, in lowlands and foothills. Some populations are migratory. Song is a ringing “wiwiwiwiwiwiwi;” call is a nasal, rising “wee-weh.”"
0,Blyth's Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus godlewskii,https://ebird.org/species/blypip1,"A mid-sized pipit with pale brown plumage and a fine, dark bill. Strong streaking on the head, mantle, and back contrasts strongly with the pale edges of the feathers. The face appears clean and the eyebrow appears to start behind the eye. The wings show distinct white bars and there are fine streaks on the breast. Extremely similar to Paddyfield and Richard’s Pipits, but slightly bigger than the former and smaller than the latter, and paler and more contrasting overall than either of them. Inhabits grassy fields. The song is a series of short, raspy notes. The call is a sharp, explosive “shpeeu,” sometimes followed by single-syllabled “chup” notes."
0,Blyth's Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus dumetorum,https://ebird.org/species/blrwar1,"Field identification challenging. Pay attention to short wings (short primary projection), gray-brown tones to upperparts and long, dark-tipped bill with a flat forehead. Song is varied with many repetitions and lots of mimicry; call is a high-pitched and loud ""tek."" Found in forest edges, bushes, marsh edges, and parks, but not particularly associated with water.

0,Blyth's Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus grandis,https://ebird.org/species/blyros1,"A relatively large rosefinch with a heavy, pale bill. The male has a mottled-pink eyebrow and cheeks and dull pink underparts. The female is brownish overall with strong streaking and a pale, lightly streaked supercilium. Best told apart from other similar rosefinches by the combination of large size, large bill, and relatively short wings and tail. Feeds on the ground. Found in high montane regions in conifer forests, or above treeline. In winter, descends to gardens and groves."
0,Blyth's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus leuconyx,https://ebird.org/species/blyswi1,"A large swift with long pointed wings and a long, deeply forked tail. It has black upperparts, tail, and wings, with a prominent white rump. Feathers of underparts broadly fringed with dirty white, and throat is whitish. Often difficult or nearly impossible to separate in the field from other similar “fork-tailed swifts,” but the white rump band is slightly thinner than that of Pacific Swift, while Salim Ali’s Swift has a slightly differently shaped white throat patch. This species is less blackish than Cook’s Swift, with a slightly wider rump band. Mostly sticks to hills while breeding, but disperses widely post-breeding and large flocks or loose individuals can be seen almost anywhere."
0,Blyth's Tragopan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tragopan blythii,https://ebird.org/species/blytra1,"A large pheasant-like bird with a short tail. Male has a yellow face, gray upperparts with white spots, a bright red breast and back of the head, and a white band on the base of the tail. Female is brown throughout, with uniform pale speckling and an indistinct pale eye-ring. Occurs in dense evergreen montane forests, where it feeds in the undergrowth. The song is a loud, wailing “oooaaahh.”"
0,Bobolink,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Dolichonyx oryzivorus,https://ebird.org/species/boboli,"Breeding male is distinctive with black body, white rump, and creamy nape. Females and nonbreeders are drastically different, yellow-brown with fine streaking on breast sides, and stripes on head. Smaller than Red-winged Blackbird with shorter bill. Spiky tail feathers. In the blackbird family, although often mistaken as a sparrow. Breeds in open fields. Listen for male's bubbly song. Often in flocks during fall migration; departs early for wintering grounds in South America."
0,Bocage's Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia bocagei,https://ebird.org/species/bocaka1,"Small, fairly plain, brown-and-orange robin-like bird. The tail is uniformly rufous-brown and the face is mostly orange. Found in the understory of forest at middle and high elevations. Shy and inconspicuous. The song is a quiet, up-and-down series of several mournful whistles. Very similar to Lowland Akalat, but has orange extending further onto the face, and found at higher elevations. Also similar to White-bellied and Gray-winged Robin-Chats, but separated from the former by uniform tail, and from the latter by the lack of a strong white eyebrow."
0,Bocage's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Nectarinia bocagii,https://ebird.org/species/bocsun2,"A slim, medium-sized sunbird with a long thin bill. Males have purple iridescence, though they look black in most light. The female is very drab. Found locally in open microhabitats within miombo woodland, including grassy glades and wetland edges. Similar to Bronze Sunbird, but male separated by the purple rather than green iridescence, and female by the lack of a strong eyebrow or streaking below. Female similar to other female sunbirds, but can be identified with care by a combination of its plainness and its overall size and structure. Vocalizations not well known, but one common call is two whistled notes given in quick succession."
0,Bocage's Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus temporalis,https://ebird.org/species/bocwea1,"A fairly large weaver with a long thin pointed bill. The male has a pale eye, and during the breeding season a brownish wash to the ear. Non-breeding males and females are dull, with olive-green upperparts and paler underparts. Found locally in areas with a mix of trees, bushes, and abundant grassy ground cover. Nests adjacent water. Gives a typical weaver chattering and rasping song, and a “chek” call. Breeding males are distinctive, and other plumages can be identified with caution by a combination of their size, long and thin bill, and the pale eyes of the males."
0,Bohemian Waxwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Bombycillidae,Bombycilla garrulus,https://ebird.org/species/bohwax,"Plump, smooth-plumaged bird with a sleek crest and white and yellow markings on wings. Mostly clean gray with brighter rusty wash on the face. Look for rich rufous undertail. Breeds in open coniferous forests at high latitudes across the Northern Hemisphere. Winter range depends on fruit crops; sometimes descends much further south in large numbers. Often found in flocks feasting on fruiting trees like crabapple and mountain ash. Listen for their ringing trills, often given while flying overhead. Compare with Cedar Waxwing in North America; Bohemian is larger and grayer, with rufous undertail and different wing pattern."

In flight the dark tail has striking yellow tips. The juvenile is dull and lacks the chest band. Pairs are bold in shrubby and open country, where they forage low in bushes or grass clumps, hopping on open ground or running between clumps looking for invertebrates. The species has a varied and complex repertoire of songs and calls, the most characteristic of which is a duetted onomatopoeic “bok-mak-ie-rie,” often delivered from a conspicuous perch."
0,Bolivian Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Oreopsar bolivianus,https://ebird.org/species/bolbla1,"Large, brown-winged blackbird of dry valleys in the high Andes of central and northern Bolivia. Prefers sparsely vegetated areas, such as Polylepis woodland, agricultural areas, towns, cactus forest, and scrublands. Brown wings are distinctive, but note that second-year blackbirds of other species (Chopi Blackbird, Shiny Cowbird) can show contrastingly brown retained juvenile wing feathers. Generally forages singly or in small groups, and sings from exposed perches. Song a simple, repeated two-part “pe-chew” given 3-8 times."
0,Bolivian Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Atlapetes rufinucha,https://ebird.org/species/rnbfin1,"Common, striking brushfinch of the understory of humid montane forest in the middle and upper elevation of the eastern slope of the Andes in central and Northern Bolivia.

In most of range, the only earthcreeper. Prefers dense understory more than other species of earthcreeper. More often heard than seen, but not hard to find once the dry staccato song is learned."
0,Bolivian Recurvebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Syndactyla striata,https://ebird.org/species/bolrec1,"Unique foliage-gleaner of dense bamboo in humid montane forest from low to mid elevations in the east slopes of the Andes. Despite its name, the bill is only very slightly recurved. Most easily found by its long, dry song. Generally in primary forest, far from human settlement, singly or in pairs. Tends to stay on small territories for long periods. From other foliage gleaners by rufous throat and supercilium, even streaking below, and straight culmen. Song a long series of accelerating but slightly sputtering dry “cak” notes."
0,Bolivian Slaty-Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus sticturus,https://ebird.org/species/bolsla1,"Small antshrike. Males are mostly gray, with a black crown and white-spotted black wings and tail. Females are mostly rusty-colored, with whitish underparts. Note the pale eyes, which help to differentiate this species from similar slaty-antshrikes. Found in semideciduous forests with dense vine tangles and adjacent second growth. Forages from the understory to middle levels and apparently does not accompany mixed-species flocks. The song is a series of nasal notes ending with a rattle."

0,Bolivian Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Zimmerius bolivianus,https://ebird.org/species/boltyr1,"Small, pale olive-gray flycatcher. Found across a wide elevational range from montane forest all the way up to elfin forest and scrub around the treeline. Perches horizontally, holding its head up; has a pale eye and lacks wingbars. Very pale belly helps distinguish it from the similar Red-billed Tyrannulet, which has a yellow belly and which overlaps with Bolivian at the lower part of Bolivian’s elevational range. Bolivian’s call is a single, descending whistle."
0,Bolivian Warbling Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Poospiza boliviana,https://ebird.org/species/bowfin1,"Striking tanager of open woodland and scrub in high elevations of the east slope of the Andes in central and southern Bolivia and extreme NW Argentina; including agricultural lands, and open Polylepis woodland. From Black-and-chestnut Warbling-Finch by white throat and paler underparts in Bolivian. Rufous band across breast distinguishes it from the similar, but gray-breasted Rufous-sided Warbling-Finch."
0,Bolle's Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba bollii,https://ebird.org/species/bolpig1,"Endemic to the Canary Islands where it is found in laurel and tree heath forests on mountain slopes. Shy and difficult to observe unless flushed. Plumage is largely grey with a purple-pink breast band. Smaller than co-occurring Laurel Pigeon from which it differs in having contrasting wings with dark flight feathers, a dark tail with a grey band and yellowish eyes."
0,Bonaparte's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Chroicocephalus philadelphia,https://ebird.org/species/bongul,"The most common small gull through most of North America, especially inland. Breeding adults have a black head, thin white eye arcs, bright red legs, light gray upperparts, and black wingtips. Note distinctive wing pattern on adults in flight: white wedge on the leading edge of the wing, with small black tips on the outer wing feathers. Nonbreeding adults and immatures have pinkish legs and a mostly white head with black ear spot. Immatures are more heavily marked with brown and black on the wings. Breeds near water in boreal forest; the only gull that makes a stick nest in a tree. Often seen in large flocks along beaches, bays, coves, and lakes during migration and winter. Feeds on small fish and invertebrates, often gracefully fluttering around and picking them off the water surface."

Note the lack of red on the shoulders and the blue forehead. Found in humid forests, where most often encountered in groups flying noisily through the subcanopy or feeding quietly. Often seen at clay licks."
0,Bonelli's Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Aquila fasciata,https://ebird.org/species/boneag2,"Medium-sized, athletically proportioned eagle, with a whitish body contrasting with dark wings and tail. Juveniles have a rufous rather than pale body and lack the adult’s broad dark band at the tip of the tail. Found in forests or mountains, sometimes in more open habitats in winter, but usually in remote areas. Builds nests in cliffs, ledges, or caves. Distinctive in flight: note bulging secondaries, and narrow wing where it meets the body. Usually seen soaring over distant ridgelines, when the shallow fingers to its wings are obvious in contrast to the deep fingers of other eagles."
0,Bonin Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus ferreorostris,https://ebird.org/species/bongro1,"Extinct, last reported in 1900."
0,Bonin Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma hypoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/bonpet,"Medium-sized, long-tailed graceful seabird, breeding on outer islands of Japan. Grayish above, whitish below, with blackish “M” pattern in upperwing, blackish cap or cowl, and bold black bars in white underwing that form a unique pattern (with extensive black in the primaries). Black-winged Petrel has much narrower black bars in underwing and blackish trailing edge to upperwing. Plumage may also resemble much larger Hawaiian Petrel, but Hawaiian has darker crown and narrower black bars in underwing."

0,Booted Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Hieraaetus pennatus,https://ebird.org/species/booeag1,"A medium-sized buzzard-like raptor but still unmistakably eagle-shaped, with long fingered primary flight feathers, a long square-shaped tail, and feathered legs (boots) prominent when perched. Two color morphs: pale morphs are distinctively two-toned and contrasting, whereas dark birds can be confused with Black Kites and Marsh Harriers. Look for distinctive pale ""landing lights"" on the shoulders when viewed head-on. Found in forested country with open patches, often in hilly areas where it frequently soars with wings slightly pushed forward."
0,Booted Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Iduna caligata,https://ebird.org/species/boowar1,"Small, recalling a beige chiffchaff or other Phylloscopus warbler. Rather nondescript: gray brown above, paler below, with a short, dark-tipped bill and conspicuous pale eyebrow. Pot-bellied with short wings and a square-tipped tail. Can be extremely difficult to identify; compare carefully with small Acrocephalus warblers and other Iduna warblers, especially Sykes’s Warbler. Found in low bushes in steppes and meadows; also bushy areas in migration and in winter. Usually forages low down, and occasionally on the ground. Song starts out with a few dry chitters, then launches into a rapidfire burst of high-pitched chattering that almost stumbles over itself. Also gives dry “tchak” and rattle calls."
0,Boran Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola bodessa,https://ebird.org/species/borcis1,"A large, long-tailed, streak-backed upland cisticola. Note the pale tips to the tail and the brown cap. Generally scarce and highly localized. Found in woodland and scrub on rocky hillsides. Extremely similar in appearance to Rattling Cisticola, and best distinguished by song, but also separated by the unstreaked brown cap and less distinct streaking on the back. Also similar to Ashy Cisticola, but richer brown overall, with an unstreaked cap. The calls are “chit” and “pit-dit” notes, which usually precede the song: a quick descending series of scratchy notes, similar to the song of Ashy Cisticola, but shorter, faster, and with less variation in pitch."
0,Boreal Chickadee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile hudsonicus,https://ebird.org/species/borchi2,"Restricted to coniferous forests in the far northern U.S. and Canada. Similar in size and shape to other chickadees, but with unique color pattern: brown cap, black throat, and rich orange-buff flanks. Typically fairly shy; can be difficult to get a good view as it sneaks through the dense spruces. Voice sounds like a wheezy Black-capped Chickadee; slower with more slurred notes."
0,Boreal Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Aegolius funereus,https://ebird.org/species/borowl,"Rare and seldom seen, this is the slightly larger and more northerly cousin of the Northern Saw-whet Owl. Distinguished from Northern Saw-whet by its colder gray-brown coloration and spotted (not streaked) forehead. Small size and boldly spotted body separate it from other owls. Fast tooting call is similar to a displaying Wilson's Snipe but with a clearer whistled tone and steadier volume. Difficult to find without a lot of effort; most often seen during ""irruption"" winters when large numbers move south in search of prey. Even then, requires intense searching of conifer groves to find a roosting bird during the daytime. Sometimes hunts small rodents around birdfeeders. Nests in tree cavities in forests with spruce, fir, aspen, and poplar."

Male has a yellow throat, black crown, and indigo belly patch. Female is similar but duller, with no indigo belly patch, a whitish throat, paler underparts, and a pale brown crown. Listen for its song, a series of well-spaced explosive but mellow “byow!”s. Widely distributed but uncommon to locally common; inhabits hill and lowland dipterocarp forests, where it seems to favor dry ridges, hilltops, and limestone areas."
0,Bornean Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Megalaimidae,Psilopogon eximius,https://ebird.org/species/borbar1,"Small, stout barbet of Borneo’s wet foothill and montane forest. Like most other barbets, sluggish and difficult to spot in the canopy. Listen for its song, a rapidfire series of hollow clucking notes that sounds distinctly unbirdlike. If seen well, note its short dark bill, bright yellow face spot, black throat, and red-and-black crown; this combination of features separates it from all other barbets in its habitat."
0,Bornean Bristlehead,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pityriasidae,Pityriasis gymnocephala,https://ebird.org/species/borbri1,"A “grail bird” of many birders visiting Borneo, this unique and unmistakable bird with an incandescent head looks like a cross between a small crow and a brightly-colored tube sock. Dark and heavy hooked bill gives it a top-heavy appearance. Often encountered in small flocks as it hops about in the canopy of primary dipterocarp and peatswamp forest in lowland and foothill areas. Vocal, frequently giving bursts of chattering notes, as well as nasal whines and whistles."
0,Bornean Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Rubigula montis,https://ebird.org/species/bkcbul4,"Attractive and distinctive bulbul. Olive-yellow back, bright yellow throat and underparts, and black head with upright crest. A species of hill and submontane forests and forest edge; restricted to northern and central Borneo.

Males are dark brown overall; females are bright rufous. Restricted to Borneo’s central and southern mountain ranges, where it inhabits foothill and lower montane forest. Similarly-sized Sunda Frogmouth mostly found in lowland forest. Blyth’s Frogmouth is proportionally longer-tailed, with stronger white markings on the wings and underparts. Vocalizations vary and are poorly understood; frequently gives a mournful descending whistle and a fluid, rippling, downslurred trill."
0,Bornean Green-Magpie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Cissa jefferyi,https://ebird.org/species/borgrm1,"Incredibly beautiful; grass-green with black mask, wine-red wings, and pale tertials. Unlike Common Green-Magpie, Bornean has pale eyes and lacks white-tipped dark tertials. Endemic to Borneo’s central mountains, where it can be found in montane forest up to the treeline. Forages in dense vegetation at all forest levels. Song varies but usually consists of a halting series of bright whistled notes."
0,Bornean Ground-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Carpococcyx radiceus,https://ebird.org/species/bogcuc1,"Secretive pheasant-like cuckoo that is more often heard than seen; listen for its dove-like “coo-KOO” song and odd sneeze-like call. Beautiful if seen well: iridescent purple-green wings, long dark tail, finely barred underparts, black head, and pale blue-green face and bill. Forages on the ground, often following ant swarms or Bornean bearded pigs as they flush out potential prey. Favors pristine lowland rainforests, particularly in riverine or swampy areas."
0,Bornean Leafbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chloropseidae,Chloropsis kinabaluensis,https://ebird.org/species/borlea1,"Accurately-named leaf-green canopy-dweller of Borneo’s central montane forests. Male has a black throat with a blue center and lemon-yellow outline. Female similar, but throat is all-dark, with no blue or yellow on the head. Both sexes have sky-blue flight feathers. Very similar to male Blue-winged Leafbird (the female of which lacks a black throat); look for Bornean’s green crown, yellow bib, paler blue wings, and more yellow-washed underparts. Gives a high thin “tseep” and a whistled “wee-chup!”, among other calls."
0,Bornean Spiderhunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Arachnothera everetti,https://ebird.org/species/borspi1,"Medium-sized spiderhunter with an olive back and streaked gray underparts. Inhabits lowland and submontane forests and forest edges, where it feeds primarily on nectar in the understory; favors blossoms of banana and ginger. Very similar in appearance to Gray-breasted Spiderhunter; range overlap is poorly understood but appears to be minimal. Look for Bornean’s more intensely streaked underparts and slightly larger size. Long-billed Spiderhunter can show some streaking on the breast but is much larger and longer-billed, with yellowish underparts. Sometimes noisy, giving loud raspy nasal calls."
0,Bornean Stubtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Urosphena whiteheadi,https://ebird.org/species/borstu1,"Minute, ground-dwelling warbler of Borneo’s central mountain ranges. Scurries about like a rodent in the undergrowth, where it can be difficult to see well; note bright orangish brow stripe, brown back, and gray sides. Very short tail and long bill give it a “cute”, top-heavy appearance. Can be quite inquisitive, frequently coming in quite close to an observer. Listen for its incredibly high thin three-note song: “tzin-tzin-tziiiiiinn”."
0,Bornean Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Collocalia dodgei,https://ebird.org/species/cavswi3,"Endemic to the central highlands of Borneo, this small, fast flier can be difficult to identify in the field where overlap occurs with the more common Plume-toed Swiftlet (formerly a subspecies of Glossy Swiftlet). A typical “white-bellied swiftlet”, with a white belly, dusky throat, and glossy dark upperparts. Compared to Plume-toed, Bornean averages more green-glossed, but this can be difficult to see in a standard flight view. Most readily identified on nests, especially in the rocky upper reaches of mountains like Kinabalu (overlaps with Plume-toed at middle altitudes). Gives a high-pitched yipping chitter, especially when near the nest."
0,Bornean Treepie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Dendrocitta cinerascens,https://ebird.org/species/bortre1,"Long-tailed corvid of Borneo’s hilly and montane forests; the only treepie in its range. Note stout black bill, black wings with white patch, and warm buffy brown underparts and face. Social and noisy; often encountered in flocks as individuals keep in contact with one another via an assortment of squawks, rasps, and clinking metallic notes. Can be fairly tame, allowing close approach, especially around trails and campsites."
0,Bornean Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala hypoxantha,https://ebird.org/species/borwhi1,"Unassuming passerine of Borneo’s central highland forests. Dark olive above and yellow below; males average brighter than females. Forages at middle levels in the forest, often joining mixed-species flocks.

Gives high whistled calls, including a shrill screeching “shreeee” and a more mellow whistled note."
0,Botha's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Spizocorys fringillaris,https://ebird.org/species/botlar1,"A small, compact lark with a boldly marked face and a small, orange-pink conical bill. Upperparts are gray-brown and underparts pale, with a streaky chest washed yellowish-buff and some diffuse flank streaks. Pairs and small groups are rare localized residents in short upland grassland on clay soils. The species prefers heavily grazed or bare trampled areas, avoiding taller grass and rocky areas. The distinctive simple “chir-ree” call, given on the ground and in flight, is often the best way to locate it. The Botha’s Lark has diffuse streaking on the flanks, while the very similar Pink-billed Lark has plain unstreaked flanks."
0,Botteri's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Peucaea botterii,https://ebird.org/species/botspa,"Rather large sparrow with flat head and long bill. Dull brownish overall with darker streaks on back; subtle head pattern with slightly darker crown and eyeline. Primarily a Mexican species with two populations, both of which barely enter the U.S.; western birds brighter than eastern birds. Prefers grasslands with some shrubs. Shy, but perches conspicuously when singing. Similar to Cassin's Sparrow; note flatter head, longer bill, lack of eyering, and voice. Gives a series of sharp varied chips and a fast trill; much different than Cassin's sweet song."
0,Boucard's Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Campylorhynchus jocosus,https://ebird.org/species/bouwre1,"Large social wren of arid scrub in interior of southwest Mexico; endemic. Favors thorn forest and cactus scrub, including around towns and villages. Usually in small social groups, which can be conspicuous at times and at other times very skulking and elusive. No similar wrens in its limited range. Note the long bill, boldly spotted underparts, and barred tail. Thrashers (Curve-billed and Ocellated) occur in same range but are appreciably larger, with plain wings and tail."

Underparts are cool gray-brown and white. Pairs are secretive in coastal evergreen forest and thickets, but they become tame around campsites and gardens, and are particularly prominent at dawn and dusk. The species is often first detected by its musical song that is consistently introduced with a two-note “teee-tooo,” followed by a delightfully varied 4-7 notes that can include imitations of other species. The similar Bearded Scrub-Robin differs from Brown Scrub-Robin by having an orange-buff rump, breast-band, and flanks, and warmer upperparts coloration."
0,Brown Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius cristatus,https://ebird.org/species/brnshr,"Medium-sized shrike with a slender black mask and rufous-brown rump and tail. Plumage varies across range: “Japanese” has the warmest rufous tones, “Philippine” has a gray-washed head and back, and “Brown” averages in between.

It avoids woodland and trees, preferring rank areas with long grass, scrubby edge, and wet heathland (fynbos). It hops and clambers through dense brush and thickets, then flies low on rapidly-beating wings in labored flight to the next bush, immediately diving into cover. But it will also perch on prominent tall shrubs, like proteas, and sing its melodious tinkling jumbled song that starts softly and gets progressively louder. It also has a distinctive flat mewing “meeeeep” call. The Moustached Grass-Warbler is similar to the Cape Grassbird, but it has a plain unstreaked back, a broad black tail, and a pale eye."
0,Cape Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Poicephalus robustus,https://ebird.org/species/bnnpar2,"Large, dark green parrot. Note the red patches on the shoulder and thighs.

The male has a brown back and uniform blue-gray coloration restricted to the head and throat. The female is differentiated from other rock-thrushes by her shape and rich buff underparts broken only by a small white patch on the central throat. Pairs and small groups occupy rocky areas in grassland, semi-arid country, and fynbos (heath). The species has also adapted to human-modified landscapes, breeding on buildings in hamlets surrounded by vegetation. Other male rock-thrushes have blue-gray backs."
0,Cape Rockjumper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chaetopidae,Chaetops frenatus,https://ebird.org/species/rufroc1,"A striking, gregarious bird that bounces about on rocky mountain slopes and crags in fynbos habitat. The sexes differ: the male has a dark rufous belly and rump, a black throat, and a white moustache; the female is duller, with a streaked chest. Pairs and small groups hop about on the ground and forage for insects between tussocks and shrubs. In territorial display, the male spreads and half-cocks his white-tipped black tail and gives a loud, rollicking “tseeur-rip, tseeur-rip, tseeur-rip” and other piping calls. The similar Drakensberg Rockjumper differs from the Cape Rockjumper by having pale orange-buff underparts and preferring montane grasslands."
0,Cape Shoveler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula smithii,https://ebird.org/species/capsho1,"A large, elongated, speckled, brown duck with a distinctive and extended spatula-shaped black bill. In flight the sky-blue forewing is distinctive; no other regularly occurring duck species shares this feature. Male has a gray head, yellow eye, and yellow-orange feet; female has a rusty-brown head, dark eye, and gray-yellow feet. Within its range, the Northern Shoveler is an extremely rare vagrant, and it differs from Cape Shoveller by the following features: male in breeding plumage has a green head and chestnut belly; female and juvenile are in general paler and more warmly colored, but some individuals may be inseparable from female Cape Shoveller."
0,Cape Siskin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra totta,https://ebird.org/species/capsis2,"A small, flighty, brown-lemon siskin of fynbos heathland, forest edge, plantations, and gullies in the arid Karoo; partial to rocky outcrops. The lemon rump, visible in flight, and the white-tipped tail and wing feathers most easily identify it. The male has a yellowish throat and underparts; the female is browner with a lightly streaked throat. The species is most often found in small groups of 2-10 individuals. A high-pitched two-note “tcheew-cheee” contact call frequently leads to detection. The similar Cape Canary has a distinctive gray hindneck and lacks the Cape Siskin’s white on the wings and tail."

0,Cape Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis nitens,https://ebird.org/species/capgls1,"A medium-sized iridescent blue-green glossy starling that lacks dark ear-patches and has greenish flanks and belly, giving it a more uniform appearance than the “blue-eared” starlings. Pairs and small groups occupy high-altitude grassland, Karoo, and savanna, including drier habitats than other glossy starlings. The species feeds on the ground and in trees on fruit and insects; often it scavenges from people. It gives a rolling “turrreaau” flight call and harsh “karrr” alarm notes. Similar “blue-eared” starlings differ from Cape Starling by being smaller and having blue-magenta flanks and belly that give them a less uniform appearance."
0,Cape Sugarbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Promeropidae,Promerops cafer,https://ebird.org/species/capsug1,"A large nectar-eating bird with a decurved beak and a long graduated tail. Dull brown above, it has strong moustache-like stripes and a yellow undertail. Pairs breed in mature mountain fynbos, where they are tied to flowering Proteas. After breeding they become nomadic, moving to areas where food is available. The species sings a characteristic grating, chipping, and twanging song. The smaller Gurney’s Sugarbird is similar, but has a much shorter graduated tail, a rusty breast and crown, and a less harsh song, and lacks the moustache-like stripes on the face."
0,Cape Teal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas capensis,https://ebird.org/species/captea1,"Medium-sized, pale gray duck with a pink bill. In flight, shows a green patch that is surrounded by white. Prefers saltwater wetlands such as natural saltpans and man-made saltworks but sometimes also uses freshwater wetlands. Similar to Red-billed Duck, but without a dark cap, and with paler overall coloration. Pink bill separates Cape Teal from all other ducks and grebes in the region."
0,Cape Wagtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Motacilla capensis,https://ebird.org/species/capwag1,"Elegant, long-tailed bird with a brownish back, pale underparts, and a black chest band. White outer tail is conspicuous in flight. Found in most open habitats, especially those near water. Feeds by walking along the ground, bobbing its tail constantly. Call is a buzzy “tseeei” that is often doubled. Song is a complex jumble of different repeated notes. Similar to Mountain Wagtail but has brown rather than gray upperparts, and Cape has less white in the wings and tail. Also similar to juvenile African Pied Wagtail but lacks a white panel in the wing."
0,Cape Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus capensis,https://ebird.org/species/capwea1,"A large weaver with a long, thin pointed bill. The male has a pale eye, and during the breeding season a brownish wash to the face. The female has a brown eye and an olive-brown belly. The species occupies open country, where it often breeds in mixed-species colonies over water or in large isolated trees. The chattering and rasping song is long and complex. The smaller Southern Brown-throated Weaver has a chunkier bill than Cape Weaver; its male has a better defined brown throat and its female has a white belly. African Golden-Weaver has reddish eyes, and Holub’s Golden-Weaver has an unstreaked yellowish back."
0,Capped Conebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Conirostrum albifrons,https://ebird.org/species/capcon1,"Small tanager-like bird found in the subtropical zone of the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia. Sharp pointed bill. Male is dark blackish overall with cobalt highlights shoulder and rump, and a blue (south) or white (north) crown. Female very different: olive above with gray head and chest and yellow belly. Her blue crown can be difficult to see. Even in poor light, easily picked out of a mixed-species flock by its frequent tail pumping."
0,Capped Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Pilherodius pileatus,https://ebird.org/species/capher1,"This gorgeous medium-sized heron is uncommon but widespread in lowlands of South America, barely extending into eastern Panama. Not likely to be mistaken: combination of silvery back, buffy neck and belly, black cap, and blue lores (sometimes radiant turquoise!) help distinguish this species from other herons. Also note the long white plumes on the back of the head. Occurs around swamps, forested ponds, and rivers, usually singly."
0,Capped Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe pileata,https://ebird.org/species/capwhe1,"Boldly-patterned open country chat. Note the white eyebrow, black mask through the eye, and black band across the chest. The outer half of the tail is black and the inner half white, which is conspicuous in flight. Found in desert, dry savanna, and short grassland. Often perches up on fences and other structures. Variable song is a fast series of clucks and whistles."
0,Capuchin Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides atripennis,https://ebird.org/species/capbab1,"A chunky, short-tailed babbler with a purple-brown body, a yellowish bill and legs, and a mostly silver-gray head; the amount of black and gray on the throat and crown differ geographically. Unmistakable if seen well. Family groups of 5–12 are local residents skulking in the undergrowth and tangles of forest, secondary growth, and riparian thickets in savanna. Groups mostly communicate with dry harsh grating calls and chattering, but occasionally give a whimsical high-pitched, downslurred thrush-like whistle: “wheeeer.”"
0,Capuchinbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Perissocephalus tricolor,https://ebird.org/species/capuch1,"Large, bizarre bird of tall rainforest. Unmistakable even when seen briefly, as they often are, flying quickly across roads or rivers. Appears broad-winged and mostly burnt orange with a disproportionately small head. Feeds on fruit in the forest canopy. Far-carrying display call of lekking males is one of the strangest avian sounds, similar to a distant chain saw or cow; males on leks can seem almost oblivious to human observers."
0,Caracas Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Arremon phaeopleurus,https://ebird.org/species/sthbrf6,"Boldly patterned sparrow with black head and white eyebrow. Back and tail olive-yellow, underparts white; black band across chest. Found alone or in pairs or family groups on ground or at mid-level in dense understory, second growth vegetation at forest edges, and coffee plantations. Can often be detected by listening for the movement of leaves as it forages. Song and calls are repetitive and very high-pitched. No similar species in range. Endemic to the Coastal Cordillera of Venezuela."
0,Caracas Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus caracae,https://ebird.org/species/cartap1,"A typical tapaculo, in bad light a plain and dark small bird with short tail. In good view, mostly plain dark gray with brown and slightly barred belly. Female more barred than male, and juvenile mostly brown and markedly barred. Acts like a mouse, staying near the ground in dense understory of bamboo thickets in cloud forest. Song nasal and noisy, one of the signature sounds in the mountains near Caracas; one version a series of four notes “wu-E-e-wu” and the another a faster series of 6 notes “wu-wU-e-e-wu-wu”; varied calls, the most common a descending mechanical rattle. The only tapaculo in its limited range in the Coastal Cordillera of Venezuela."
0,Carbonated Sierra Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Rhopospina carbonaria,https://ebird.org/species/casfin1,"Plump tanager of arid lowlands in central Argentina, chiefly in northern Patagonian scrub. Similar to larger Mourning Sierra-Finch, but Carbonated has a less deeply curved top of bill, extensive black on underparts, and, in males, a pure yellow bill."
0,Cardinal Lory,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Pseudeos cardinalis,https://ebird.org/species/carlor1,"A thick-bodied, long-tailed parrot with entirely red plumage. The head appears slightly brighter than the body. Widespread in most habitats up to around 1200 meters of elevation. Unlikely to be misidentified due to its unique entirely red coloration. Most common call is a high-pitched rising “tsleet!”"
0,Cardinal Myzomela,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Myzomela cardinalis,https://ebird.org/species/carmyz1,"A small, strikingly plumaged myzomela with a bright crimson red head, back, and rump and black wings, belly, chest, and tail. Thin bill decurved. Female mostly dark reddish, with darker ruddy brownish coloration where male would be black. Seems to prefer forest habitats, but widespread. Unique coloration of both sexes should identify this species with certainty. Vocally shy. Common call is a repeated high-pitched, insect-like “tseet.”"
0,Cardinal Quelea,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Quelea cardinalis,https://ebird.org/species/carque1,"The red head of the breeding male is distinctive. Non-breeding male and female are nondescript streaky brown birds with buffy eyebrows. Found in moist, grassy habitats, where it often appears after recent rain. Most records are of territorial breeding males. Becomes inconspicuous when not breeding, mixing with flocks of other weavers and seedeaters. The call is a rough “chyet” and the song is an accelerating series of annoyed-sounding notes. Breeding male very similar to breeding male Red-headed Quelea, but has less red on the nape and more on the breast, for a more cleanly “hooded” look."
0,Cardinal Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Chloropicus fuscescens,https://ebird.org/species/carwoo1,"A small, compact woodpecker with heavily streaked underparts and a solid black moustachial streak. In the female the top of the head is completely dark, while in the male the forecrown is brown and hindcrown and nape are red. Pairs inhabit a wide range of savanna, woodland, forest-edge, and riverine forest, where they feed in dead branches and smaller twigs ignored by larger woodpeckers. An angry-sounding, dry, trilled rattle call often gives it away."
0,Carib Grackle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Quiscalus lugubris,https://ebird.org/species/cargra1,"Common in northern South America and the Lesser Antilles. Found in a variety of open habitats, including around towns and cities, especially abundant along the coast. Male is glossy black with a pointed bill and a yellow eye. Tail is fairly long and wedge-shaped. Females are dark grayish-brown with slightly paler on underparts and a yellow eye. Smaller and shorter-tailed than Great-tailed Grackle."
0,Caribbean Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Leptotila jamaicensis,https://ebird.org/species/cardov1,"Retiring dove of forest floor, heard much more frequently than seen. Like other members of the genus, can be found walking quietly on shady roadsides and trails, especially early and late in the day. Not easily told by sight from White-tipped Dove, which occurs alongside Caribbean in Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. Best feature is white face and pale bluish nape of Caribbean Dove. Also compare Gray-headed Dove. In flight, all species show white tail corners and rusty on underwings."
0,Caribbean Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia martinica,https://ebird.org/species/carela1,"Rather drab and inconspicuous flycatcher of tropical woodland, semi-open areas with bushes and trees. Often found at fruiting trees, where eats small berries. Limited overlap in range with slightly larger and brighter Yellow-bellied Elaenia, which has a spiky, white-based crest, unlike Caribbean, which usually holds its crest flattened; also note that Caribbean has a bright orange base to the underside of its bill, duller wingbars, and different voice; does not flick its wings or tail."
0,Caribbean Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/carmar1,"A graceful aerial feeder found over a wide variety of open habitats, especially near water, including marshes and towns. Often seen on exposed perches including power and telephone lines in villages. Commonly found in flocks of up to twenty birds, sometimes mixing with other swallows and martins. Note the male’s diagnostic glossy purple-blue plumage and snow-white belly. Females and immatures are similarly patterned, but have brown mixed with the blue and are probably not safely separable from Cuban Martin. Female and immature Purple Martins are very similar, but they often have a scaly breast and finely streaked belly, with less contrast between belly and chest. Notably, Cuban and Purple Martins are not present in this species’ range from March to September. Calls include a harsh “churr,” a buzzy “zwick-zwick,” and a musical buzzy burbling."
0,Carmelite Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Chalcomitra fuliginosa,https://ebird.org/species/carsun2,"A large, dark sunbird that is usually found near the coast, although inland populations exist locally, perhaps most notably in Angola. Occurs in a variety of disturbed and edge habitats as well as in swamps and coastal woods. Males are overall chocolate-brown with iridescent purple-pink throats and foreheads, while females are a much paler olive-brown with noticeably darker throats. Bill is relatively straight. Distinguished from the smaller and more compact Green-throated Sunbird by its larger size, its small purple throat and crown, and the female’s dark throat. Calls include liquid “pip” notes and buzzy trills, with songs comprising variable combinations of these notes."
0,Carmiol's Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Chlorothraupis carmioli,https://ebird.org/species/olitan1,"Large, chunky tanager. Very nondescript: entirely olive-green with greenish-yellow throat. Note thick bill. Sexes alike. Usually found in groups, sometimes in mixed feeding flocks with other species. Stays fairly low in the lower and middle levels of forests in lowlands and foothills. Listen for its strikingly loud song in the early morning."
0,Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Cacatuidae,Calyptorhynchus latirostris,https://ebird.org/species/slbblc1,"Black cockatoo with white ear patch and white tail panel, found in the southwestern corner of Western Australia, where it inhabits a wide variety of habitats, including woodlands, pine plantations, farmland, and urban parks. The very similar Baudin’s Black-Cockatoo has much longer upper mandible. Calls include mournful, wailing cries, as well as loud, rough screeches."
0,Carola's Parotia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Parotia carolae,https://ebird.org/species/carpar1,"A fairly large, short-tailed bird of mid-montane forest canopy. Male is mainly black with white flanks, golden throat, bronzy-scaled chest, white stripe down the forehead and 6 antennalike feathers projecting from the back of the head. Note the yellow eye. Female is gray-brown above and strongly-barred below with a heavy white stripe above the eye. Male dances at a terrestrial court, where it gives one of the most elaborate displays in the bird world. Co-occurs with Lawes’s Parotia but Carola’s male has white flanks and female lacks a black head. One of many different vocalizations is a loud, quavering shriek."
0,Carolina Chickadee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile carolinensis,https://ebird.org/species/carchi,"This tiny, plump-bodied, big-headed bird is a familiar woodland resident and backyard visitor in the southeastern U.S. The only chickadee in almost all of its range. Gray overall with contrasting head pattern: black cap, white cheek, and black throat. Short, stubby bill is used for hammering open seeds. Often the core of mixed flocks of songbirds. Visits feeders. Nearly identical to Black-capped Chickadee, but range barely overlaps. Especially note voice, duller gray wings, and less buffy coloration on flanks of Carolina. Beware that hybrids occur frequently in the overlap zone and some are best left unidentified."
0,Carolina Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Conuropsis carolinensis,https://ebird.org/species/carpar,"Extinct, last reported in 1918."
0,Carolina Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Thryothorus ludovicianus,https://ebird.org/species/carwre,"Bold white eyebrow. Warm brown above, buffy-orange underparts. Slightly decurved bill. Tail is about as long as body and often cocked up. Usually in hiding in dense vegetation, tangled understory, or brush piles in forested areas. Nests in peculiar places around backyards, such as tucked in a drainpipe or grill. Occasionally feeds on suet or mealworms at feeding stations. Listen for loud, ringing song and variety of calls. Unlike House Wren they are not migratory and stay nearby their breeding grounds year-round."
0,Carp's Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Melaniparus carpi,https://ebird.org/species/cartit2,"A black tit with a mostly white wing and outer tail. The sexes are similar, but females are slightly duller and browner. Found in arid savanna and mopane woodland. Usually in pairs or small groups, which are loud and conspicuous. Call is a classic tit “chee-chi-chi-chi-chi,” raspy and often repeated. Overlaps very locally with the very similar Southern Black-Tit in northern Namibia. Carp’s Tit can be identified by its all-black rather than white-barred undertail, and by having more white in the wing."
0,Carpentarian Grasswren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Amytornis dorotheae,https://ebird.org/species/cargra2,"Small, long-tailed, brown-and-black-streaked bird with white throat, rusty flanks, and black moustache. Known from a few small areas from around Borroloola (Northern Territory) to near Mount Isa (Queensland), where large spinifex clumps grow in sandstone outcrops or stony hills. Frequent burning of these areas has made this species very hard to find. Usually seen foraging on the ground in pairs or small groups. Near Mount Isa, there is possible range overlap with Kalkadoon Grasswren (lacks the white throat; more uniformly brown)."
0,Carrion Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus corone,https://ebird.org/species/carcro1,"The quintessential big black crow, without obvious field marks. Juvenile Rook has longer, more pointed bill with more extensive feathering on base. Smaller than Common Raven, which has longer, wedge-shaped tail, heavier bill, shaggy throat, and deeper voice. Ravens soar and glide readily, whereas crows typically flap continuously. Common in varied open and semi-open habitats from towns and farmland to open woodland and moorland. Found in pairs or small groups; large flocks only at roosts. Typically gives raucous caws."
0,Carrizal Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Amaurospiza carrizalensis,https://ebird.org/species/carsee1,"Small, chunky finch with thick gray bill. Male deep blue-black, female brown, both sexes with white underwings. Mostly found in pairs in the understory of spiny bamboo forest. Song a fast musical warble of four or six notes “pee PEEu pee PEEu peePEEuu.” Similar to Blue-black Grassquit, which is smaller with a more conical bill; also to Amazonian Grosbeak, which is larger with a bulkier bill. Little known, endemic to the southern lowlands of Venezuela."
0,Carruthers's Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola carruthersi,https://ebird.org/species/carcis1,"Relatively colorful, mid-sized, long-tailed cisticola. Note the gray-brown back with thick black streaks, rufous on the wing and cap, and whitish underparts. Found mainly in papyrus swamp and locally in other wetland habitats. Song is a quick, aggressive series of several “chyap” notes. Very similar to Winding Cisticola, and best separated by song; Carruther’s also has a less reddish panel in the wing and a mostly dark tail."
0,Carunculated Caracara,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Phalcoboenus carunculatus,https://ebird.org/species/carcar1,"Strikingly patterned raptor of the high Andes in Ecuador and southern Colombia. Note pied plumage pattern, white streaks on black breast, and orange face. Immatures are brown with pale patches in the wings (visible in flight). Similar to Mountain Caracara, which may overlap with it in southern Ecuador, but adult Carunculated has breast streaking, and immatures have barring on rump. Inhabits open areas such as paramo and farmland, sometimes congregating in large numbers."
0,Carunculated Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus granulifrons,https://ebird.org/species/cafdov1,"A unique small, colorful fruit-dove confined to Obi island. Pale gray head contrasts with mostly emerald-green body, except for gray markings on the wings and back, a deep maroon belly patch, and a lemon-yellow vent and undertail. An odd, fleshy wattle of protruding yellowish skin above the bill (“caruncles”) is distinctive. Found in canopy of forest, forest edge, and nearby secondary growth in the lowlands. Gives a distinctive soft, deep, guttural call, “gu-rOW,” the first note often soft and hard to hear."
0,Caspian Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus cachinnans,https://ebird.org/species/casgul2,"Difficult to separate from Yellow-legged Gulls and Herring Gulls without a careful appraisal of plumage characters. Candidate birds may draw attention by slender-billed, long-legged, and slim appearance. Flattened crown, rather small dark eyes, and usually unstreaked head are also useful characters. Wingtip (primary) feathers in adults have long tongues of white that penetrate into the black tips. Juveniles have prominent pale underwings. Breeds and winters predominantly on inland water bodies with some movement toward coasts in winter."
0,Caspian Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius asiaticus,https://ebird.org/species/casplo1,"Stately plover with a gentle, dovelike expression. Breeding male is stunning, with a white face and belly separated by a broad chestnut patch across the chest. Breeding female is plainer brown, and has a warm rusty-brown patch across the chest. Nonbreeding adults and juveniles are grayish-brown with pale fringes to the feathers of the upperparts, as well as a pale face and belly. Oriental Plover is similar in nonbreeding plumage, but note the white stripe on the wing when Caspian is in flight. Inhabits open areas, near water when breeding and often away from it when wintering. Gives short nasal calls when in flight."
0,Caspian Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus caspius,https://ebird.org/species/cassno1,"As other snowcocks, Caspian Snowcock is large and heavy and is gray overall with a paler head pattern and white undertail coverts. Compared to the very similar Caucasian Snowcock, Caspian is slightly paler, especially breast, and plumage includes gray tones on nape. Breeds on extreme high, rocky mountains. Song is a loonlike, desolate, far-carrying cry."
0,Caspian Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Hydroprogne caspia,https://ebird.org/species/caster1,"Largest tern in the world; widespread but typically uncommon. Thick, bright-red bill is distinctive; most have small dark marking near the tip. Note solid black cap in summer which turns to black streaks in winter. Juveniles have V-shaped markings on the upperparts. Feeds by cruising over lakes, rivers, estuaries, and reservoirs looking for fish, then plunging to catch them. Smooth wingbeats, more gull-like than choppy flight of small-bodied terns. Very vocal, giving loud raucous screams. Compare especially with Royal Tern, which is slightly smaller and more slender, and has a thinner, more orangey bill."
0,Caspian Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile hyrcanus,https://ebird.org/species/castit2,"Small plain tit. Note diagnostic brown cap, raggedly-demarcated bib, and richly-colored dark brown upperparts. Very similar to closely-related Sombre Tit, but ranges do not overlap.

Females are similar to Purple Finch but with more diffuse face pattern and finer streaks on flanks. Both sexes tend to show more peaked head and longer bill than House and Purple Finch. Found in mountainous regions, mainly in coniferous forests, drifting to lower elevations in winter. Visits feeders."
0,Cassin's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Muscicapa cassini,https://ebird.org/species/casfly1,"Slim flycatcher that is mostly gray, with black wings and tail. Found along rainforest streams and rivers at low and moderate elevations. Usually perches on rocks or low on dead branches. The quiet song is a mix of rasps, trills, and high-pitched whistles. Water-loving habits usually separate this species from other gray flycatchers. Similar to Dusky-blue and Ashy Flycatchers, but plainer on the face than those species."
0,Cassin's Kingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus vociferans,https://ebird.org/species/caskin,"Fairly large yellow-bellied flycatcher of the southwest U.S. and western Mexico. Dark gray head contrasts with white mustache. Also note blackish tail with white tip (but this can be difficult to see, especially when worn). Found in open, arid habitats with tall shrubs and trees, sometimes venturing up into clearings and meadows in mountains. Most similar to Western Kingbird, which is paler and less contrasting on the head. Listen for burry “ch-breer” calls."
0,Cassin's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Peucaea cassinii,https://ebird.org/species/casspa,"Dull sparrow lacking distinctive patterns. Found in grasslands with scattered bushes. Generally grayish-brown with barely noticeable blurry streaks on breast and sides, thin white eyering, and pale edges on wing feathers. Back is patterned with rufous and black. Very diffuse head pattern. Most similar to Botteri's Sparrow; where range overlaps, look for Cassin's smaller bill, thin white eyering, and voice. Gives a pleasant musical song; a few varied notes followed by four whistles on different pitches ""see-soo, see-say."""
0,Cassin's Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Neafrapus cassini,https://ebird.org/species/casspi1,"A distinctive swift of lowland forest that appears nearly tailless. The wings appear “pinched” at the body but are otherwise fairly straight and broad. Distinctively patterned, with a black throat, wings, and back, a white belly, a white vent, and a narrow white band on top of the rump. Vocalizations and nests are undescribed. Overall pattern is similar to Sabine’s Spinetail, but Cassin’s extremely short tail gives it a unique, forward-heavy profile."
0,Cassin's Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo cassinii,https://ebird.org/species/casvir,"Fairly dull vireo, intermediate between Blue-headed and Plumbeous. Grayish-olive overall, but with yellowish flanks and greenish back. Note white spectacles contrasting with gray head and two whitish wingbars. Breeds in mixed coniferous forests, especially in mountainous areas; winters in Mexico. Often separable from Blue-headed and Plumbeous Vireos by range, but can overlap during migration and winter. Cassin's is less contrasty than Blue-headed, especially between the gray face and whitish throat, and the greenish back blends into the nape and crown. Some birds are best left unidentified."

0,Chestnut Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus castaneoventris,https://ebird.org/species/cherai1,"Secretive, very large rail (approaching Australasian Swamphen in size), only likely to be seen in and near mangroves, foraging in the mud along tidal creeks and estuaries in northern Australia. Olive brown above, chestnut below, with gray head, chalky yellow bill, and yellow legs. Calls loudly, with grunts and wild honking squawks."
0,Chestnut Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sporophila cinnamomea,https://ebird.org/species/chesee1,"Handsome seedeater. Males are mostly chestnut with a gray cap, wings, and tail, while females are sandy-colored and difficult to separate from other female seedeaters. Rare; found in marshy areas with tall grass, migrating north in the austral winter."
0,Chestnut Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer eminibey,https://ebird.org/species/chespa1,"An unusual small, richly colored sparrow of dry country. Males are completely chestnut with a darker head. Females are rufous-brown on the back, mostly gray on the head, and pale below. Found in rather dry savanna and woodland. Nests colonially and usually found in flocks, sometimes large, and sometimes mixed with other bird species. Male resembles breeding male Chestnut Weaver, but is much smaller overall, and smaller-billed. Female is similar to female House and Somali Sparrows, but more richly colored. The common calls include chirps, chatters, and a slow trill of chirping notes."
0,Chestnut Teal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas castanea,https://ebird.org/species/chetea1,"Male is very distinctively marked with a metallic green head, and rich chestnut flanks, but the female is a plain gray duck with a rounded crown. Female distinguished from Gray Teal by slightly darker neck/throat. White wing panels are distinctive in flight compared to purple/green of Pacific Black Duck."
0,Chestnut Quail-thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cinclosomatidae,Cinclosoma castanotum,https://ebird.org/species/chequt1,"Heavily patterned terrestrial bird of eastern South Australia, northwestern Victoria, and western New South Wales. White eyebrow and moustache, with a deep chestnut-brown back and intricately patterned wing. Female has white belly and gray chest, male white belly, gray flanks, and black chest and throat. Note gray sides rather than warm brown sides of Cinnamon and Chestnut-breasted quail-thrushes. Usually seen walking around in areas of open mallee woodland and shrubland. Call a long, high-pitched whistled ""seeeep."""
0,Chestnut Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus rubiginosus,https://ebird.org/species/chewea1,"Large, heavy-billed weaver in which breeding males have an unusual color scheme: chestnut with a black head. Non-breeding males and females are plain grayish-brown with buff on the breast. Highly nomadic species of dry savanna, which can appear in large numbers after rains and begin nesting in large colonies. Males are oddly similar to Chestnut Sparrow, and they often nest alongside that species, but are easily separated by their larger size and black head. Non-breeding male and female are remarkably colorless, lacking the greenish and yellowish tones shown by similar weavers."
0,Chestnut Wood-Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Odontophorus hyperythrus,https://ebird.org/species/chwqua1,"This chickenlike bird is bright rufous on the face and underparts and brown above. Female similar to male but rufous more restricted to the upper breast with contrasting gray belly. Also note slight crest, stout bill, and some bare gray skin around the eye. Uncommon in cloud forest of western Colombia. Shy and difficult to see; stays in small groups on the forest floor and rarely comes out in the open. Listen for rollicking whistled song, similar to other wood-quail."
0,Chestnut Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Celeus elegans,https://ebird.org/species/chewoo2,"A “classic” Celeus woodpecker, medium-sized and rufous overall with a shaggy crest. Unlike the similar Scale-breasted and Waved Woodpeckers, Chestnut Woodpecker mostly or entirely lacks black markings on the body and wings. Sexes are similar, but males have a red mustache. The color of the crest varies across subspecies: some birds have a contrasting golden crest, while others have a plain rufous crest like the rest of the body. Widespread but uncommon across much of northern South America, where it inhabits the mid-levels of lowland forests and edges, especially around water."
0,Chico's Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Zimmerius chicomendesi,https://ebird.org/species/chityr1,Recently-described flycatcher of short-stature Amazonian white sand forests. Has green-olive upperparts and yellow underparts. Note the white eyes. Predominantly forages for mistletoe in the canopy and subcanopy and rarely accompanies mixed-species flocks.

0,Chiguanco Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus chiguanco,https://ebird.org/species/chithr1,"Fairly common in Andes and western desert foothills. Found in varied habitats from parks and gardens to farmland and other semiopen habitats with hedges and taller trees. Two distinct populations: in northern and western birds, sexes look alike, dark ashy gray overall with a yellow bill and amber eyes; in southern and eastern birds, male is dull blackish with a yellow bill and eyering and female is dark ashy gray overall with a yellow bill. No similar species in Chile, but in Bolivia and Peru compare with larger Great Thrush, which prefers more humid habitats."
0,Chihuahuan Raven,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus cryptoleucus,https://ebird.org/species/chirav,"The raven of dry grasslands and desert scrub from the southwestern U.S. to central Mexico. Very similar to Common Raven, and sometimes best left unidentified. Chihuahuan is slightly smaller and more compact than Common, and tends to be found in more open habitats at lower elevations, not in mountains or forests (although Common can be found in low grasslands, too). Neck feathers are white at the base on Chihuahuan, instead of gray. Occurs in pairs or flocks, sometimes quite large, especially in winter. Gives a rather dry, crow-like squawk."
0,Chilean Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus chilensis,https://ebird.org/species/chifla1,"Widespread and often numerous; found at shallow lakes and lagoons from the high Andes to Patagonian steppe and even in coastal waters. Adult is distinctive: pale pink with a salmon-pink “bustle” and grayish legs with red feet and “knees.” Immature often obviously smaller than adult, but has longer bill “hook” than the smaller and shorter-legged James’s Flamingo. Chilean Flamingo lacks the clean-cut black triangle on closed wings seen on Andean Flamingo. Far-carrying calls can suggest honking of geese."
0,Chilean Flicker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Colaptes pitius,https://ebird.org/species/chifli1,"No similar species in its range. Found in woodland, forest, matorral, and farmland with taller trees and hedges; often feeds on the ground. In some areas of central Chile nests in colonies in dirt bluffs, such as along roadsides; elsewhere usually nests in holes drilled in trees. Note the gray crown and plain buffy face (with dark whisker on male), big white rump patch, and yellow shafts to wing feathers (mainly visible in flight). Loud shrieking calls sometimes draw attention."
0,Chilean Mockingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus thenca,https://ebird.org/species/chimoc1,"Common and conspicuous bird of central Chile, especially in drier regions. Favors open and semiopen habitats, especially matorral and scrubby hillsides, but also in town parks and farmland.

In summer often seen flying over Patagonian steppe or associating with Kelp Gulls at beaches, dumps, river mouths, and lakes near the coast. Also found well offshore, where it chases other birds to steal their food. Usually seen as singles or small groups. Plumage variable, but always with some orange tones—sometimes bright and extensive, sometimes limited to underwing and base of tail. The only skua likely to be seen in Chile and southern Argentina."
0,Chilean Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Tachycineta leucopyga,https://ebird.org/species/chiswa1,"Common and familiar swallow of southern South America; found widely from the coast to Andean foothills and from open forests to beaches. Often near water and regularly around towns and villages, associating readily with slightly smaller Blue-and-white Swallow. Identified easily in most of range by clean white underparts and big white rump patch; also note that the tail is less deeply forked than Blue-and-White Swallow. Juvenile is duller above and with a variable dusky breast band."
0,Chilean Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothoprocta perdicaria,https://ebird.org/species/chitin1,"Cryptically plumaged chickenlike bird of matorral shrubland, open scrub, and farmland; endemic to central Chile. Found as singles or small groups; most often seen along roadsides early and late in the day. Usually runs away, but if disturbed will flush explosively from underfoot with shrieking whistles. The only tinamou in its range, but compare with distinctively patterned California Quail, which often occurs in same areas. Song is a short, abrupt whistle; given irregularly and hard to trace."
0,Chilean Woodstar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Eulidia yarrellii,https://ebird.org/species/chiwoo1,"Tiny, highly endangered hummingbird found very locally in the desert of northern Chile. Favors native desert scrub in lowland valleys, but widely eliminated from most areas by intensive agriculture. Male most often detected by insectlike buzz made by wings in flight. Also perches conspicuously atop bushes and on wires; note diagnostic crossed tail feathers. Female similar to Peruvian Sheartail, but has shorter tail with pale rusty bases to outer feathers (hard to see)."
0,Chimango Caracara,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Milvago chimango,https://ebird.org/species/chicar1,"Noisy, conspicuous, and often a common scavenger in habitats ranging from towns and cities to open forest, farmland, and beaches; ecological counterpart to crows.

Note spotted breast sides, indistinct pale eyebrow, and chestnut wings and tail. Pairs stay fairly low in deciduous forest and scrub, often skulky and difficult to see. Listen for fast sputtering trills."
0,Chinese Babax,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Pterorhinus lanceolatus,https://ebird.org/species/chibab2,"A large and boldly-marked but secretive babbler of hilly and mountainous regions, where it sticks to dense shrubbery. Note white eyes, streaky brown plumage, and dark chestnut “moustache” stripes on each side of the throat. Pops into the open to sing, but timid and soon disappears back into the undergrowth."
0,Chinese Bamboo-Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Bambusicola thoracicus,https://ebird.org/species/chbpar3,"While common in bamboo forest, this loud and colorful partridge can be found in a range of other shrubby and semiopen habitats. Not particularly shy; singing males can be located by their far-carrying song, a rising series of piercing single and triple notes. The combination of a gray-blue brow and chest, orange cheeks and breast band, and large black spots on brownish yellow flanks make this species unmistakable in its range."
0,Chinese Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Megalaimidae,Psilopogon faber,https://ebird.org/species/chibar1,"A brightly-colored inhabitant of tropical forest canopies. Slow moving and well camouflaged; its loud and far-carrying song, combined with its secrecy, ensure that it is usually heard far more often than seen. If seen well, combination of red-and-yellow throat, blue ear, black crown, and green body distinguish it from any other similarly sized birds in its range. Regularly visits fruiting trees."
0,Chinese Beautiful Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus davidianus,https://ebird.org/species/chbros1,"A heavily marked rosefinch that is closely related to and extremely similar to Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch. Male averages more extensively pink with a broader pink brow. The female, on the other hand is almost indistinguishable; look for a more square-tipped and slightly shorter tail. Best distinguished by calls; gives sharp metallic notes instead of Himalayan Beautiful’s more mellow trills and twitters. Inhabits similar montane scrub and open forest habitat, occasionally ventures down into the outskirts of towns and villages; often singly or in pairs."
0,Chinese Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus mandarinus,https://ebird.org/species/chibla1,"Large dark thrush of open forests, gardens, and farms; one of the more common urban birds throughout much of its extensive range. Frequently seen on lawns and fields away from cover, pulling up worms and other invertebrates. Both sexes dark with orange bills, the male black overall, the female dark brown. Sings beautifully from exposed perches throughout the day, a series of loud melodic notes that varies between individuals. Often gives a shrill shriek or a series of “wuk” notes when alarmed or agitated."
0,Chinese Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis glaucicomans,https://ebird.org/species/butfly2,"One of a number of confusingly similar blue flycatchers. Male is brilliant blue above with orange throat and breast; note off-white lower belly. His dark orange throat distinguishes him from Blue-throated Blue Flycatcher. Female is drab brown with an orange chest, white belly, and dull rufous tail. Note weak orangish eyering, dull tannish throat, and overall warm brown coloration. Brown flanks in both sexes. Breeds in montane and hilly forest, typically in areas with dense undergrowth; winters at lower altitudes. Musical song is composed of trills and whistles; calls are a hard “tak” or “chek.”"
0,Chinese Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella tacsanowskia,https://ebird.org/species/chbwar1,"Typical brown bush-warbler; forages quietly deep in dense undergrowth. Prefers wet areas such as reedbeds, riparian shrubbery, and marshy groves. Dirt-brown above with a white throat and brown-washed underparts. Some adults have light streaking on the throat, but streaks are thinner and less extensive than those of Baikal Bush Warbler. Song is insect-like and similar to that of Baikal Bush Warbler, but with a coarser, more scraping quality."
0,Chinese Crested Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Thalasseus bernsteini,https://ebird.org/species/chcter2,"Critically endangered tern, long thought to breed solely on a few islands off the coast of China's Fujian province but recently noted breeding on islets off South Korea as well. Similar to Great Crested Tern (among which it nests) but smaller and paler, with darker outer primaries and dark cap that extends to the base of the orange-tipped bill. Much larger Great Crested has yellowish-green bill and white at bill base. Voice similar to Great Crested but higher in pitch."
0,Chinese Cupwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pnoepygidae,Pnoepyga mutica,https://ebird.org/species/chicup1,"A tiny porcelain ball of a bird mounted on wire-thin legs. Rich dark chocolate brown above and finely scaled below with distinctly black-centered pale fathers; darker birds have black-and-tan underparts, while light birds have black-and-white ones. Speckling of tan spots on the crown and neck distinguish this species from the smaller Pygmy Cupwing. Extremely similar to closely related Scaly-breasted Cupwing; best distinguished by range and song. Shy and difficult to see. Skulks about in wet, well-shaded areas in foothill and montane forests, often near streams, gullies, and boulder fields. Far more easily heard than seen; listen for its a loud ascending series of fluid warbling notes."
0,Chinese Egret,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Egretta eulophotes,https://ebird.org/species/chiegr,"Medium-sized white egret. Breeding adult has bright blue loral skin, a pinkish-orange bill, and long frilly plumes on the head, neck, and back. Nonbreeding adult lack plumes and has dull greenish legs and bill. Nonbreeding birds can be confused with Little Egret, but note Chinese Egret's thicker bill, proportionally stouter legs, orangish base to the bill, and dark lores with a shallow crook between eyes and bill. Light morph of Pacific Reef-Heron may also be similar, but average much thicker-billed and thicker-legged than Chinese. Moves between craggy islands and coastlines when breeding; winters in mangroves, estuaries, and mudflats."
0,Chinese Francolin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Francolinus pintadeanus,https://ebird.org/species/chifra1,"Gamebird of dry, shrubby areas; especially common in hilly and montane regions. Male has white cheeks and rufous on the crown, shoulders, and vent, but is predominantly covered with delicate black-and-white scaling. Female is similarly intricate in her patterning but is browner and less bright overall. Singing males often stand on exposed rocks and hilltops to give their song, a metallic series of notes often likened to “come-to-the-peak-ah-ah!”"
0,Chinese Fulvetta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Fulvetta striaticollis,https://ebird.org/species/chiful1,"Dull brown fulvetta with pale eyes, found only in central and south-central China. Note streaky throat, dark lores, and pale, narrow wing panel. Distinctive in its blandness; no other fulvetta in the region is essentially all brown with no dark eyebrows or significant patches of warmer, brighter colors. Occurs at 2200-4300 meters, favoring areas with shrubby oak or rhododendron cover. Typically forages low down or at middle levels of forest. Not as social as the “Alcippe” fulvettas, and are often encountered singly or in pairs, though small groups do occur. Song is a simple but variable series of whistles in which the first note or two rise and the last one or two fall, sometimes with an intermediary note in between: “tsi-tsi-dih-deer-deer.” Call is a high-pitched chittery rattle."
0,Chinese Grassbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pellorneidae,Graminicola striatus,https://ebird.org/species/chigra1,"A seldom seen and poorly understood shy, streaky, brown babbler. Stays low and hidden in tall grassy and reedy vegetation within fields and wetlands. Brown above with a pale breast and a long tail. The crown and back are streaked with black, giving it the appearance of an overgrown cisticola, but the distinctive patch of black-and-white streaking on the nape is unlike that of any warbler. Appears singly and in pairs."
0,Chinese Hwamei,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Garrulax canorus,https://ebird.org/species/melthr,"A medium-sized thrushlike bird of dense forests and undergrowth. The reddish brown coloration and white spectacles are distinctive. Usually skulks in dense vegetation, but may sing from an exposed perch or forage out in the open during dawn and dusk. Usually observed singly or in pairs. The song is loud, long, and varied, involving mimicry of other birds, whistles, and harsh notes that are often repeated. Introduced to Taiwan, Japan, and the Hawaiian Islands."
0,Chinese Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus yunnanensis,https://ebird.org/species/chilew1,"Small plump leaf warbler. A “Pallas’s-type” leaf warbler: stout, with a pale rump, crown stripe, and prominent brow stripes. Olive-yellow above with a faint gray wash on the nape. Chinese is distinguished from Pallas’s by its paler, more faded-looking brow and crown stripes, less yellow suffusion all over the body, less compact appearance, and less obvious or absent upper wingbar. Extremely similar Gansu Leaf Warbler and Lemon-rumped Warbler can be difficult to separate; note Chinese’s slightly more elongated and less rounded appearance, a lack of a distinct hook under the end of the brow stripe, less contrasting and more yellowish head patterning, and paler yellowish secondaries. Forages actively, often hovering and hopping about at mid-level. Breeds in montane broadleaved deciduous or mixed forest; moves to lower elevations in winter. On average, found at lower altitudes than Lemon-rumped and Gansu. Lengthy song is unique and bizarre, with a twanging, grating quality: “btrichi-btrichi-btrichi.” Call is an explosive “wip!”, often repeated in medium-length series on the breeding grounds."
0,Chinese Monal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophophorus lhuysii,https://ebird.org/species/chimon1,"An inhabitant of rocky highland meadows, this glorious pheasant often forages in boulder fields in early morning and late afternoon. Adult male a veritable phoenix, with glittering blue back and tail, flame-colored neck, glossy green head, and black underparts. Blue patch of skin between eye and bill unique among monals. Less colorful female streaky brown with pale skin around the eye. Male gives a whistle recalling a rusty door hinge and high-pitched piping calls."
0,Chinese Penduline-Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Remizidae,Remiz consobrinus,https://ebird.org/species/chptit1,"Handsome small songbird of fields and wetlands with extensive reedy cover. Both sexes light brown with white-bordered dark mask. Male has a gray crown with rufous tones in wings and neck, female more uniformly colored above. Flies lightly and bouncily; flying flocks cluster tightly together. Forms large flocks in the winter, when they sometimes feed with reed buntings. Calls are high-pitched and thin, often with a rasping quality."
0,Chinese Pond-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola bacchus,https://ebird.org/species/chpher1,"Often mistaken for an egret in flight due to its all-white wings, but the dark head separates it from any egret. This medium-sized heron is found across many different marshy habitats. Breeding adults have a chestnut head, neck, and breast, and a veil of bluish-black plumes over the white wings. Nonbreeding adults and juveniles are brown all over save for the white wings. In areas where the ranges of multiple pond-heron species overlap, nonbreeders and juveniles are best left unidentified."
0,Chinese Rubythroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope tschebaiewi,https://ebird.org/species/chirub1,"Handsome male is gray above with a bright red throat, black chest, and white belly. Also note white eyebrows and “moustache” stripe, as well as white panels and edges on a black tail. Female is duller, cold gray-brown above with a white belly and throat. Extremely similar to Himalayan Rubythroat: note gray flecking on white flanks of male and white “moustache” (striking in males, pale and sometimes unnoticeable in females). Breeds in alpine and subalpine open areas with scattered scrub and boulders; preferred habitat averages higher and more open than Himalayan. Winters in lowland scrub. Song is a series of loud rich warbles, which average shorter and less varied than those of Himalayan Rubythroat."
0,Chinese Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx sinensis,https://ebird.org/species/whbsho5,"Shy and skulky ground-dweller of hill forests with dense undergrowth; especially favors damp, dark areas near streams, fallen trunks, and accumulated debris. Male is slate-blue, with paler undertail and lower belly; also note his thin white eyebrow. Female is dark dirt-brown, with paler underparts and a faint rufous eyering. Difficult to see in tangled understory, but can be readily detected through the male’s song, a series of pure, short whistles followed by a quick jumble of notes, which sometimes include a buzz. Calls include a “tchik” and a rattling series."
0,Chinese Sparrowhawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter soloensis,https://ebird.org/species/grfhaw1,"Attractive accipiter of wooded habitats. Adult gray above with orange-suffused white underparts; also note bright yellow cere (skin around the nostrils). In flight, solid black wingtips stand out against otherwise pale underparts, diagnostic for this species. Juveniles dark brown above and streaky below, similar to Japanese Sparrowhawk, but underwing coverts unmarked or very lightly marked instead of heavily marked as in Japanese."
0,Chinese Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Otocichla mupinensis,https://ebird.org/species/chithr2,"Medium-sized, stout thrush, brown above, white below, with a black-spotted underparts and dark crescent behind the ear coverts.

0,Chinspot Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis molitor,https://ebird.org/species/chibat1,"A cute, dumpy, colorful flycatcher-like bird lacking chestnut in the wings. Sexes differ: the male has a broad black chest band and a white throat; the female has a chestnut band and a large chestnut throat spot that gives the species its name. The Chinspot Batis is common in savanna, broadleaf woodland, and edges of montane forest, where it can be found solitarily or in pairs, often joining mixed-species flocks. It flits actively between trees, gleaning and hawking insects. Gives a characteristic downslurred three-note “three-blind-mice” call, which is occasionally accompanied by clicking and bill-snapping."
0,Chinstrap Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Pygoscelis antarcticus,https://ebird.org/species/chipen2,"Classy-looking medium-sized penguin. Slender “chinstrap” is unique and unmistakable, but can be difficult to see at a distance; instead, note this species’ white face, dark bill, and cleanly flat-bottomed dark cap. Breeds in colonies on rocky terrain in the Subantarctic, particularly in the southern Atlantic. Winters as far north as far southern Argentina. Gives loud, hoarse barking and braying calls on the breeding grounds."

The female is like the male but has a pale base to the beak. Singles and pairs are resident in the mid-story and canopy of mid-altitude and montane forest, mostly between 1200–2200m, where it may join mixed flocks. Voice a strident repeated upslurred “swick-swick-swick….”. Only marginally overlaps with similar Black-headed Apalis, which is more contrasting than Chirinda: darker above and paler beneath, and in zone of overlap has a pale eye."
0,Chirping Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola pipiens,https://ebird.org/species/chicis1,"Relatively colorful, mid-sized, long-tailed cisticola. Note the gray-brown back with thick black streaks, dull rufous on the wing and cap, and pale underparts. Found in reedbeds, especially papyrus and phragmites. The distinctive song is a few hesitant “chyep” calls followed by a long, dry trill. Very similar to Luapula Cisticola, and best separated by song. Visually, Chirping Cisticola is slightly larger, the tail is browner, and the rufous crown and wing patch are duller."

Favors surviving primary rainforest, but can sometimes be found in secondary growth; can be found on roadsides through suitable habitat when hunting. The only resident owl on the island; the migratory Northern Boobook is a winter visitor to the island, and is significantly larger and much darker overall, with an all-brown head and brown-striped white underparts. Present species gives an odd, distorted-sounding “qwr-qwerk.” Begging birds give a shrill trill. Unfortunately, like many other Christmas Island species, has suffered declines due to the introduced yellow crazy ant, which has caused the owl to disappear from parts of its range."

Juveniles have same cheek pattern but are dingy grayish overall without yellow tones (or just faint yellow face). White wingbars conspicuous in all plumages; also note pale lores. More tied to water than Eastern Yellow, Western Yellow, or White Wagtail; usually seen at marshes and lake edges. Contact call ""tsriip,"" harsher than Eastern and Western Yellow Wagtail."
0,Citrine Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Myiothlypis luteoviridis,https://ebird.org/species/citwar1,"A rather dull yellowish warbler, more suffused with olive than other members of its genus. The yellow is brightest on the throat and eyebrow. Compare with Black-crested Warbler, which has a bolder yellow eyebrow and a black crown. Found in the Andes from Venezuela to Bolivia, from around 2,300-3,400m. Fairly common. Pairs forage in the lower levels of forest and edge, often among mixed-species flocks."
0,Clamorous Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus stentoreus,https://ebird.org/species/clrwar1,"Large brown reed warbler with a long, powerful-looking bill. Birds in the Middle East and northeastern Africa average warmer brown than in southern Asia. Most readily confused with other large reed warblers. Oriental Reed Warbler has a “rough-looking,” vaguely streaked throat unlike the clean throat of the Clamorous Reed Warbler. Worn birds may not be identifiable to species level, especially if seen poorly. Great Reed Warbler is similar, but has pink instead of gray legs. Song is loud and jumbled series of harsh grating sounds. Calls include loud, forceful, and hard-sounding chuck’s and churrs."
0,Clapper Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus crepitans,https://ebird.org/species/clarai11,"Large, generally drab rail, but plumage variable depending on location. Can look very similar to King Rail. Atlantic coast birds dull grayish-brown overall with few contrasting features; faintly barred gray-and-white on sides and pale orange bill. Gulf Coast population brighter with orange neck, more similar to King Rail; note paler and more diffuse barring on sides and less contrasting dark streaks on back. Almost always found in saltmarshes close to the coast, where it can be abundant and vocal. Never in inland freshwater marshes, where replaced by King Rail. Usually shy, but regularly seen feeding along the edge of channels. Listen for series of harsh ""kek"" notes or loud, rasping grunts erupting from marsh. Sometimes hybridizes with King Rail where fresh and saltwater meet; some birds best left unidentified."
0,Clark's Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Aechmophorus clarkii,https://ebird.org/species/clagre,"Large, long-necked grebe with very long, thin, yellow-orange bill. Black cap ends just above red eye, so the eye looks isolated in the white face. Long, gray body rides low in the water. Breeds on marshy lakes, where it builds a floating nest of vegetation. Mostly found on saltwater bays and open ocean in winter, but also lakes. Very similar to Western Grebe, with extensive range overlap and often in mixed flocks. Typically outnumbered by Western where they occur together. Clark’s looks paler overall, especially on the sides and face. Also look at the bill: brighter orange-yellow on Clark’s, lacking a dark lower edge. Some birds appear intermediate and should be left unidentified."
0,Clark's Nutcracker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Nucifraga columbiana,https://ebird.org/species/clanut,"This relative of jays and crows is pale gray with a whitish face and black wings. Sexes are similar; juveniles are browner than adults. Found almost exclusively in coniferous forests at high elevations; feeds on pine cone seeds and stashes thousands of them in various places to eat later in the winter. Often found in flocks. Sometimes visits feeders. Similar in color to Canada Jay, but especially note bill shape: long, slender, and sharply pointed."
0,Clarke's Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus golandi,https://ebird.org/species/clawea1,"An unusual and distinctive forest weaver with a long, thin bill. Males have a black hood and a yellow belly. Females much duller, with a yellow-olive head. Both sexes have yellow edges to the wing feathers. Found very locally in Kenya in the canopy of coastal forest and lush woodland. Usually in active flocks. Somewhat similar to Forest Weaver, but separated by many details, including the yellow wing edges. Vocalizations are typical of weavers: “chek” notes and a squealing, sizzling “radio static” song, often given by a whole group in concert."
0,Claudia's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus claudiae,https://ebird.org/species/clalew1,"One of the Blyth’s-type warblers, this species regularly flicks its wings one after the other. Usually forages actively high up in the canopy, clambering along branches. Breeds in well-forested areas, but can be found in sparser forest edges in the winter. A large leaf warbler, it has a pale belly, weak wingbars, and a strong brow and crown pattern. Listen for its song, a squeaky and repetitive series of rolling whistled notes.The closely related Hartert’s Leaf Warbler is very similar but averages brighter yellow, especially on the crown stripe. Calls of the two species are very similar—a quick ‘pee-chuh!’—but their breeding ranges do not overlap. Overlaps on wintering grounds with very similar Blyth’s Leaf Warbler, from which it may be impossible to separate at times; note whiter brow stripe (particularly at the back), less yellow underparts, and slightly different voice."
0,Cliff Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Hirundinea ferruginea,https://ebird.org/species/clifly1,"This unmistakable long-winged flycatcher is widespread (though rarely very numerous) throughout much of South America. As the name implies it occurs around cliffs, landslides, and even buildings. Medium size, warm rufous coloration (brightest on the wings), and habitat are distinctive. Some variation across range, with birds in the Andes having more whitish speckling on the face. Compare with Streak-throated Bush-Tyrant, which is larger and has a streaked throat. Usually seen singly or in pairs, perched conspicuously on a snag, rock face, powerline, or building."
0,Cliff Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Petrochelidon pyrrhonota,https://ebird.org/species/cliswa,"Compact swallow with a short, square tail. In flight, looks slightly less angular than other swallows, with more rounded wings. Note pale buffy-orange rump, which separates Cliff from most other swallows in range. Also look for dark throat and pale forehead. Widespread and fairly common, especially in western North America. Breeds under bridges, overpasses, and culverts. Winters in South America. Compare especially with Cave Swallow, which has a paler throat and orange forehead."
0,Cloud Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola textrix,https://ebird.org/species/clocis1,"Tiny, short-tailed, streaky, brown cisticola. Has a longer tail in non-breeding plumage. Found in fynbos and grassland habitats. Inconspicuous for most of the year. Usually seen when doing a flight display over its breeding habitat. The song consists of an ascending series of high whistles, followed by lower “chek” notes, which sometimes continue as the bird dives to the ground. Very similar to other small, short-tailed cisticolas, especially in non-breeding plumage. Best distinguished by voice."
0,Coal Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Periparus ater,https://ebird.org/species/coatit2,"Small, active tit. Combination of large black bib, white wingbars, and broad white stripe on nape distinctive. Dazzling geographic variation: Himalayan and Chinese birds have a small, spiffy crest; north African birds have stained yellow cheeks; European and Siberian birds dullest overall, crestless and with buffy flanks. Fairly common to common in coniferous and mixed woodland, forest, parks, gardens; visits bird feeders. Associated with foothills and montane areas throughout much of its eastern range. Often joins mixed-species flocks in autumn and winter, moving quickly through the foliage. Compare with slightly larger and chunkier Marsh Tit and Willow Tit, which have bigger white cheek patches, drabber overall plumage, and different voices."
0,Coastal Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola haematocephalus,https://ebird.org/species/wincis4,"A relatively colorful, medium-sized, long-tailed cisticola. Note the gray-brown back with thick black streaks, the brown on the wing and cap, and the whitish underparts. Found in wetlands and moist grassland and scrub. As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Very similar to Winding Cisticola, but paler overall, and differs vocally. Also similar to Rattling Cisticola, but more colorful, with very different vocalizations: a wheezy, very high-pitched trill, and raspy “chi-dup” calls that are often given in a display flight."
0,Coastal Miner,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Geositta peruviana,https://ebird.org/species/coamin1,"A pale terrestrial bird found only in coastal deserts of Peru. It is pale brownish-gray and lacks strong field marks. Very similar to Grayish Miner; Coastal Miner has a wing stripe, though this is only evident in flight. The two species mostly separate out by range, with Coastal Miner favoring the flat coastal plain and Grayish Miner preferring rocky slopes of hills and mountains. Coastal Miner is also similar to Short-tailed Field Tyrant, but lacks distinct wingbars and rump patch, and has a longer tail. Solitary, usually seen running through barren, sandy areas. Occasionally flies up to perch on a rock or bush, and also performs flight displays."
0,Cobb's Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Troglodytes cobbi,https://ebird.org/species/houwre5,"Endemic to the Falkland Islands, where it is found in seashore areas and offshore islets, typically in association with tussac grass. Often forages on rocky beaches, picking at food items washed up by the tide. Somewhat similar House Wren has wandered to the Falklands before, but note present species’ gray-brown head and neck, lack of a prominent eyering, and longer darker bill. Can be tame and confiding, allowing close approach. Rattling song, somewhat similar to that of House Wren, can be given from an exposed perch or deep in cover. Calls include nasal mews and harsh, dry churrs and rattles."
0,Cocha Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus praecox,https://ebird.org/species/cocant1,"Rare antbird nearly endemic to the lowlands of eastern Ecuador. It was recently found in neighboring Colombia, and is likely to occur over the border in Peru as well. Male is pure black. Female is chestnut with a black hood. Both sexes are very similar to White-shouldered Antbird, but lack blue markings around the eye. Male also similar to male White-shouldered Antshrike, but lacks white wing markings and lives in different habitat. Cocha Antshrike is usually encountered in pairs that skulk low in swampy forest along the edge of ponds and sluggish creeks. Typical song is a fast, monotonous series of clucks."

Best separated from similar Spectacled Thrush by its all black bill and lack of bold eyering. Song is a series of sweet up-slurred and down-slurred whistles. Calls are quite different than Spectacled Thrush and include a quick, slightly squeaky “ji-ji-ji-ji-ji” and a paired “chee-ip, chee-ip.”"
0,Cocoa Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Xiphorhynchus susurrans,https://ebird.org/species/cocwoo1,"Warm brown bird with buffy streaks on head and breast; hitches up tree trunks. Generally longer tailed and longer billed than a woodpecker. Very similar to many other species of woodcreepers. Focus on bill: long, fairly thick, and almost straight; generally pale grayish with fleshy tones, but darker on top edge. Listen for song, a long series of clear whistled notes fading slightly at the end. Found in wooded habitats, often in more open forest, edge, or second growth."
0,Cocoi Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea cocoi,https://ebird.org/species/cocher1,"Large and lanky with gray-blue back, white neck, and black cap. Widespread and conspicuous (though not abundant) in marshes, rivers, and lakes from Panama to southernmost Chile and Argentina, usually at low elevations. Can be seen singly or in congregations with other herons. Where range overlaps with Great Blue Heron, look for white neck and more extensive black cap."
0,Coconut Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Trichoglossus haematodus,https://ebird.org/species/railor4,"Very long-tailed lorikeet, mostly green but bright red chest and underwing is striking in flight. Dark hood with thick yellow border is striking. Generally in wooded lowlands but recorded to more than 2000m in some locations. Unique within its range. Similar Rainbow Lorikeet has a purple belly patch and more vibrant purple face, but the two do not overlap. Gives a series of chattering notes while perched, in flight sharp screeching squeals betray its presence."

Body is warm dirt-brown and head is white; some birds possess brown splotches or speckles on the crown. Birds in the northern part of the range have black collars of varying extent separating the white of the head from the brown of the body. Similar to White-hooded Babbler, but Collared’s white head is more sharply demarcated, ending promptly at the breast instead of extending down to the belly. Flocks give loud rattling calls as they move through thick undergrowth, particularly bamboo stands, in lowland and foothill forests."
0,Collared Bush-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Tarsiger johnstoniae,https://ebird.org/species/cobrob1,"Male is unmistakable, with a glowing silver supercilium, black hood, and fiery orange shoulder and collar. Female is more somber in plumage, brownish above, buffy below, with a trace of the male's pale brow.

Females difficult to separate from other flycatchers but have large white primary patch in the wing. Breeds in deciduous forests, nesting in cavities and quick to take advantage of nest boxes. The song is a high-pitched series of whistled notes; alarm call is a dry ""pik."""
0,Collared Forest-Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Micrastur semitorquatus,https://ebird.org/species/coffal1,"Large and lanky, but heard much more often than seen. Widespread in tropical forest, ranging into semi-open areas with larger trees; in West Mexico it even occurs up into pine-oak forest high in the mountains. Hunts from canopy to forest floor, but usually calls from high in trees. Note the long yellow legs and long rounded tail with narrow white bars. Adults are usually white below, with dark ‘sideburns,’ but can be buffy below, and very rarely are black overall. Immatures have variable dark barring below."
0,Collared Gnatwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Microbates collaris,https://ebird.org/species/colgna1,"A tiny, long-billed bird of forest understory. Brown above and white below with a black crescent across the chest. Note striking facial pattern with white eyebrow and black malar mark. General impression is wren-like with long bill, contrasting eyebrow, and tail usually held cocked. Difficult to see well, as it tends to remain in dense understory growth around treefalls and other gaps in tall rainforest, where it is locally distributed and never common. Usually seen alone or in pairs. Song is a long, descending whistle, repeated at roughly three-second intervals, very similar in tone and pace to second note of Tawny-crowned Greenlet’s song. Harsh scolding note is perhaps the best giveaway to this species’s presence. Generally unmistakable given a decent view; in silhouette could be confused with Long-billed Gnatwren but has much stronger face pattern and is usually confined to dense undergrowth rather than the vine tangles inhabited by Long-billed."
0,Collared Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Mycerobas affinis,https://ebird.org/species/colgro1,"Large, bulky, bright-colored finch of middle to high altitude broadleaf and mixed forests.

Upperparts are greenish-blue, rump brighter blue, with blue wings and tail and white underparts. Female and juvenile slightly duller. Subspecies mainly differ in plumage, with upperparts varying from blue to green to olive-toned, white loral spot sometimes extending as a supercilium, and underparts sometimes buffier. Gives carious vocalizations, but most common call is a “kek-kek-kek-kek.” Frequents mangroves and tidal creeks, though sometimes inhabits other coastal habitats, including coconut plantations in islands."
0,Collared Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra collaris,https://ebird.org/species/collar1,An elegant lark with rich rusty upperparts and white feather fringes that create a scaly effect. The complete dark band across the chest and the dark streaking on the nape are unique; the white eyebrow and throat create a bold face pattern. Underparts are pale and clean. Resident in dry thorn savanna on red sands. Its long whistle “wheeeeooooo” is sometimes accompanied with a wing-clapping display in which the bird rises 10–15 meters before parachuting back to the ground. Foxy Lark is similar to Collared in shape and coloration but lacks the dark breast and neck markings.
0,Collared Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Trochalopteron yersini,https://ebird.org/species/collau1,"Halloween-themed laughingthrush: decked out in black, gray, and orange. Combination of black head, silver ear patch, orange neck and breast, and multicolored wings are unmistakable in range. Bizarrely reminiscent in patterning of much smaller Silver-eared Mesia and Golden-breasted Fulvetta. Inhabits mid- to high-altitude forests, where it rummages around in the understory in small groups. Makes an odd rising, screaming yodel that sounds strangely like the call of an Indian Peafowl."

Found mainly inside of eastern and northern Madagascar rainforest, though very locally in dry forest. Most often seen when located by local guides, sleeping on the forest floor during the day, usually below a pandanus. Apparently completely silent, which is bizarre for a member of the nightjar family. When perched, distinguished from Madagascar Nightjar by its rufous collar; in flight, by its lack of white in the wings."

Note the gray head, pale eye, rufous back, and black mark outlining the throat. Found locally in thickets within palm savanna. Distinctive song consists of an emphatic series of airy, wailing notes. Also gives chattering and rasping calls. Spotted Morning-Thrush is similar, but Collared is separated by its pale eye, bright rufous back, and lack of spotting below. Somewhat similar to nightingales and scrub-robins, but easily separated by its black throat markings."
0,Collared Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma brevipes,https://ebird.org/species/colpet1,"A small gray-and-white petrel with a dark hood, a bold dark “M” pattern across the upperwings, and a distinctive bold black underwing pattern. Very variable. A pale morph resembles Gould’s Petrel, while a distinctive sooty-brown dark morph shows exceptionally bold underwing markings. Pale morph separated from Gould’s Petrel by its much bolder underwing pattern and its hood, which often meets below the neck, creating a full collar. Silent at sea."
0,Collared Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius collaris,https://ebird.org/species/colplo1,"Uncommon, petite plover of beaches, coastal lagoons, lakeshores, gravel bars, and sandbars along rivers. Note slender black bill, brightly patterned head, narrow black breast band, and long pinkish legs. Despite the name, does not have white collar around back of neck like most small plovers. Typically found in pairs or as single birds; not in flocks like many other small plovers. At high tide they often roost with other plovers such as Wilson’s and Semipalmated plovers."
0,Collared Pratincole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Glareolidae,Glareola pratincola,https://ebird.org/species/colpra,"Elegant, agile flier that looks like a cross between a plover and a swallow. Adult is warm gray-brown with an elegant “necklace” and red bill base. Juvenile is grayer, with white-fringed feathers. Very narrow (sometimes unnoticeable) white trailing edges to wings and dark rusty underwings distinguish this species from similar pratincoles. Usually seen in buoyant flight over open country, from dry fields to grassy wetlands with muddy shorelines. Inconspicuous on the ground; note short-legged and very long-winged “horizontal” profile. Feeds mainly in flight, sweeping back and forth like a giant swallow to snatch aerial insects."
0,Collared Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Bucco capensis,https://ebird.org/species/colpuf1,"Distinctive medium-sized rainforest bird, easily recognized by large, mostly bright cinnamon head and orange bill, whitish underparts, and clean black band completely encircling nape and breast. Inhabits lower and middle levels of tall rainforest, sometimes up to the canopy, where it sits motionless before making sudden flights to bark, foliage, or ground for large insects and small vertebrates. Encountered singly or in pairs, but rather seldom seen due to lethargic behavior. Typically silent during the day; song—given well before first light—is a wild-sounding series of quavering notes that is unlike that of any other bird."
0,Collared Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus lettia,https://ebird.org/species/cosowl1,"Medium-sized owl with significant variation in plumage and vocalizations across its large range.

0,Collared Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Hedydipna collaris,https://ebird.org/species/colsun2,"A tiny, short-billed sunbird with a metallic-green back and a yellow belly. The male has a green throat and a narrow purplish breast band; the female is duller, with a yellow throat and no breast band. Pairs frequent forest edge, woodland, and savanna, where they join mixed-species flocks to glean leaves and hover to catch insect prey. But they will also feed on fruit and nectar, often by piercing the base of a flower and sucking out nectar without pollinating. The “yellow-bellied” races of Variable Sunbird differ from Collared Sunbird by being larger, with a longer bill and broader purple-blue breast band."

0,Common Nightingale,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Luscinia megarhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/comnig1,"Fairly common to uncommon summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Best known for its rich powerful song, often given at night, when it can keep people awake. Found in varied wooded and scrubby habitats, typically with shady understory. Typically rather shy and elusive. Plumage plain overall: brown above with a pale eyering and rusty-brown tail, drab pale grayish below with variable buffy wash. Replaced in northern and eastern Europe by very similar-looking Thrush Nightingale."
0,Common Ostrich,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Struthioniformes,Struthionidae,Struthio camelus,https://ebird.org/species/ostric2,"Massive, conspicuous, flightless bird with long neck and robust legs. Mature males have black-and-white plumage, with pinkish skin, flushed in breeding plumage. Females and immatures are duller gray-brown. Small groups roam open and lightly-wooded country; can walk up to several kilometers a day. The stubby wings are used for spectacular breeding displays and dust-bathing. Deep booming calls can be heard from long distances. Similar Somali Ostrich (no range overlap) has slaty-colored skin and pale eyes, unlike the pink-skinned Common Ostrich."
0,Common Paradise-Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Tanysiptera galatea,https://ebird.org/species/copkin1,"A long-tailed kingfisher of lowland forests. White underparts and rump, dark blue upperparts with pale blue shoulder and crown. Long white tail with 2 extended central tail feathers ending in spatula tips. Sits still for long periods whilst slowly pumping its tail. Very similar to Little Paradise-Kingfisher, but Common Paradise-Kingfisher is larger, with a paler crown, white rather than blue outer tail feathers and a heavier bill. The safest way to separate, however is by vocalization. Heard more often than seen. Song, a rapidly accelerating and slightly rising series of dry notes."
0,Common Poorwill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Phalaenoptilus nuttallii,https://ebird.org/species/compoo,"Small, compact night bird with short wings and tail. Intricately patterned with shades of gray; flight feathers are barred with rufous. Males have white corners on tail, females have browner tail corners. Named for its song: a whistled ""poor-WILL,"" sometimes with a faint third note. Strictly nocturnal; more often heard than seen. Prefers rocky desert slopes with some dry vegetation; sometimes perches prominently when singing but also sings from the ground."
0,Common Potoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Nyctibiidae,Nyctibius griseus,https://ebird.org/species/compot1,"Strange nocturnal bird like a mix between an owl and a nightjar. Large head and huge yellow eyes. Overall grayish-brown with splotchy patterning. Black mustache stripe helps distinguish from Great Potoo, along with smaller size. Spends the daytime perched on the end of a snag, where it blends in perfectly and becomes very difficult to spot. At night, hunts mainly for flying insects from an exposed perch. Found in open forested habitats with scattered trees, such as forest edges, along rivers or roadsides, or even in disturbed patchy woodland. Listen for mournful series of whistles, descending in pitch: “POO, POO, Poo, poo, poo.”"
0,Common Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Coturnix coturnix,https://ebird.org/species/comqua1,"Small pear-shaped gamebird. Breeds in taller grassland and grain fields from western Europe east to central Asia and winters in similar habitat in Africa, southern Europe, and South Asia. Rarely seen, and most often detected by male’s emphatic whistled ""wet-my-lips!"" song, which can be given at night. When flushed, explodes from underfoot and flies off strongly with whirring wingbeats and short glides. Plumage cryptic and streaky brown with pale eyebrow; male has black throat stripe. Very similar to Japanese Quail, whose male has a much darker face; females, immature birds, and domestic types (kept as captive for eggs and can escape) are probably not safely separable in the field."
0,Common Raven,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus corax,https://ebird.org/species/comrav,"Large, glossy-black bird with a wedge-shaped tail. Larger than a crow with a longer, thicker bill. Distinctive shape in flight, with rather long, swept-back wings and long tail. Note smoother, steadier wingbeats compared with faster, choppier wingbeats of crows. Extensive range throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Found in a wide variety of habitats, including desert, coniferous forest, coastlines, sagebrush, tundra, and grasslands. Often solitary or in pairs, but can gather in small groups. Typical call is a loud, guttural croak, but makes an astonishing variety of other strange noises. Compare with Chihuahuan Raven in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico."
0,Common Redpoll,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Acanthis flammea,https://ebird.org/species/comred,"Small finch fond of colder climates.

0,Common Redshank,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa totanus,https://ebird.org/species/comred1,"Stocky brown wader with bright red legs; compare with slenderer, far more gracile Spotted Redshank in juvenile and non-breeding plumage. Often rather wary, alerting other birds with its loud, fluty, whistled calls. Bobs tail when nervous, and then flies to show flashy white trailing edge to wings, white rump patch. Feeds in muddy shallows, probing and picking with its bill. Inhabits fresh and coastal wetlands; also breeds on moorland, usually near water."
0,Common Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Phoenicurus phoenicurus,https://ebird.org/species/comred2,"Fairly common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Found in mixed and deciduous woodland, heathland with trees and hedges; often uses scrubby coastal habitats during migration. Unobtrusive; tends to perch rather upright and has distinctive habit of shivering its bright orangey tail. Male handsome and distinctive, with black face and throat offset by white brow, bright orangey breast, blue-gray back. Female drab gray-brown overall except for bright tail. Female told from female Black Redstart by warmer, buffy-brown (not grayish) breast."
0,Common Ringed Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius hiaticula,https://ebird.org/species/corplo,"Stout shorebird with a stubby bill. Note orange legs, often bright on spring adults. Breeding plumage has bold black-and-white head and breast pattern; nonbreeding has subdued and browner pattern. Bill is bright orange with a dark tip when breeding, dark otherwise. In flight shows bold white wing stripe. Mellow whistled “poo-ee” call quite distinct from call of more slender and ""spectacled"" Little Ringed Plover. Breeds on sandy and stony substrates from beaches and lakeshores to moorland above treeline. Winters coastally, where often roosts with other small waders such as Dunlin."
0,Common Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus erythrinus,https://ebird.org/species/comros,"Medium-sized, dumpy finch with a stubby bill. Male are distinctive with a red head, breast, and rump, brown eye-mask, and white belly. The amount of red varies with age. Females and juveniles are a rather unprepossessing, uniform brown inviting confusion with female House Sparrows; note the two pale wingbars. Breeds at both low and high elevations in deciduous scrub, meadows, and marsh edges as well as clearings in forest. Far-carrying, whistled, typically 3-note song is memorable."
0,Common Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Actitis hypoleucos,https://ebird.org/species/comsan,"Small bicolored sandpiper which often bobs its tail in a distinctively wagtail-like manner. Plain brown with white underparts; distinguished from bulkier and rounder-headed Green Sandpiper by a prominent white spur at the shoulder.

Mainly found as singles or in small groups, not in flocks or mixed with other species."
0,Common Scimitarbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Phoeniculidae,Rhinopomastus cyanomelas,https://ebird.org/species/cosbil1,"An elongated matte-black bird with black legs and a slender, strongly-decurved black bill. Females and juveniles are browner on the front. In flight it has white tail tips and a single band of white towards the end of the wing. Avoids forest; singles or pairs are found in arid and broadleaved woodland, where they are found clambering around on trunks, probing for invertebrates, and often joining mixed-species flocks. It is most easily detected by its plaintive, whistled, three-noted “wheeep, wheeep, wheeep” call. The very similar Black Scimitarbill differs from tby having a shorter, less decurved bill and a shorter tail. Abyssinian Scimitarbill has an orange bill. Woodhoopoes are larger, with chunkier reddish bill, more social habits, and glossy iridescent plumage."
0,Common Scoter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Melanitta nigra,https://ebird.org/species/blksco1,"Fairly common sea duck; feeds by diving. Breeds on tundra lakes; winters at sea in coastal bays, estuaries, harbors. Rarely seen inland on fresh water, mainly during migration periods. Occurs locally in flocks of hundreds, but also found as singles and small groups. Male distinctive: wholly black with raised knob at base of bill, yellow wedge on top of bill. Female dark brown overall with pale cheeks. In flight looks all-dark, often flying in rather tight groups low to fairly high over the sea."
0,Common Shelduck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Tadorna tadorna,https://ebird.org/species/comshe,"Distinctive, large, rather gooselike duck of coastal wetlands, tidal mudflats, and nearby grassy fields. Striking plumage often looks simply black-and-white; at close range, head is deep glossy green, broad breast band dark rusty. Male has raised knob at base of red bill; juvenile duller overall, with whitish face and eyering. Less numerous and more local inland at lakes and along rivers. Often seen walking and grazing, at times in flocks."
0,Common Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago gallinago,https://ebird.org/species/comsni,"Fairly common in wetland habitats from damp meadows to saltmarshes. Mostly inconspicuous, feeding in muddy ground by probing with its very long bill, usually near reeds or other grassy cover. Often not seen until flushed, when usually rises from fairly close range with rough rasping call. Breeding birds are more conspicuous, perching on fence posts. Note cryptic, stripy plumage, very long bill. In Asia and Australasia, beware of extremely similar Pin-tailed, Swinhoe's, and Latham's Snipes, all of which lack the white trailing edge of Common and have a slower, less erratic flight. In display flight, birds stoop from high overhead and produce a pulsating, bleating sound from air passing through their fanned tail."
0,Common Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus apus,https://ebird.org/species/comswi,"Almost always seen in flight, which, as the name suggests, is swift. Nests in cavities in cliffs and buildings. Ranges widely over any habitat in search of aerial insects, often over lakes and reservoirs where swallows congregate. Usually flies higher than swallows except when swooping low to drink by splashing briefly on water surface. Bigger and longer-winged than swallows, with dark plumage, strong stiff wingbeats, faster and more direct flight. Lacks the white rump patches of similarly-sized Pacific Swift (and other ""fork-tailed swifts"") and various needletails."
0,Common Tailorbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Orthotomus sutorius,https://ebird.org/species/comtai1,"A common warblerlike bird with a green back, a reddish crown, and a long bill. It gets its name from the way in which it builds its nest by stitching leaves together. A ubiquitous inhabitant of parks, gardens, and wooded areas across South and Southeast Asia. Its loud “tuui-tuui…” and “whee-whee…” calls are often part of the sound of daily life in human habitation. Co-occurs with the very similar Dark-necked Tailorbird in NE India and SE Asia, but is separable by call, and by the lack of a rufous hind-crown, and yellow vent."
0,Common Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna hirundo,https://ebird.org/species/comter,"Medium-sized tern found on open ocean, beaches, and large lakes. Adults have pale gray body and black cap. Bill color differs by subspecies: most have red bill with black tip, but some Asian birds have all-black bills. First-years show dark outer primaries, dark shoulder, and black restricted to back of neck. Similar to Forster's, Arctic, and Roseate Terns. Separated from breeding Forster's Tern by entirely gray upperwings; nonbreeding Forster's shows black ear patch. Somewhat longer-billed and shorter-tailed than Arctic Tern, with paler body. Shorter-tailed and overall darker than gleaming white Roseate Tern. Often found in large flocks, especially in late summer. Gives a harsh screeching call ""KEEE-yurrrr."""

Bold white wing band striking in flight; tail broadly tipped black."
0,Common Woodshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Tephrodornis pondicerianus,https://ebird.org/species/comwoo1,"A medium-sized woodshrike with grayish-brown upperparts, black facial mask, white rump, and gray tail with white outer tail feathers. Bill strongly hooked, dark grayish-brown in color. Underparts white. Similar to Malabar Woodshrike and Large Woodshrike, but generally found in drier forests; also note prominent white supercilium. Usually found in dry forested areas and shrublands. Bright, fast-paced song starts out with two strident “wheeet” notes, followed by a descending series of shorter notes. Calls vary, but usually sound like isolated fragments of song."
0,Common Yellowthroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Geothlypis trichas,https://ebird.org/species/comyel,"Small warbler, dull olive overall with intense yellow throat. Adult males have black mask bordered above by a white band. Females and immatures are duller but always have contrasting yellow throat and undertail coverts. Common and widespread breeder throughout North America. Found in shrubby wet areas, including marshes, forest edges, and fields. Often hides in thick vegetation, but males often perch conspicuously when singing. Listen for ringing “witchity-witchity-witchity” song and low, harsh call notes. Very short, rounded wings, which equates to it being a short-distance migrant: winters from the southern U.S. to Central America."
0,Comoros Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/ashcus3,"A medium-sized bird with a gray back, a black hood, and pale underparts. There is an unusual and rare olive morph in which the head and back are olive-gray and the underparts greenish-buff. The juvenile is a drastically different-looking heavily streaked and spotted bird. Found locally in montane forest on the islands of Grand Comoro and Moheli. The most common vocalizations are a descending high-pitched series of soft whistles and a mild, chatty series of “chew” and “tew” notes. Within its small range, most similar to Grand Comoro and Moheli Bulbuls, but easily separated by the paler underparts and lack of an orange bill."
0,Comoros Green-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Treron griveaudi,https://ebird.org/species/madgrp2,"Chunky, medium-sized pigeon that is mostly pale green with black wings and a pale wing stripe. Flight is very fast and direct. Sometimes found alone, though more often in small groups. Widespread but erratic; local abundance linked to the availability of fruit, its main food. Found in humid forest, secondary forest, and plantations. Endemic to the island of Mohéli in the Comoros. Voice is a quiet but maniacal combination of sputters, whistles, and cackles. Easily identified, as it is the only green pigeon within its tiny range."
0,Compact Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Pachyphantes superciliosus,https://ebird.org/species/comwea1,"Has a typical weaver color scheme but an unusual shape: a chunky body, heavy bill, and short tail.

One of Earth’s rarest birds, it has only been encountered a handful of times in montane Albertine Rift forest with bamboo, including forest edge. Call unknown, but a record of a bird calling similarly to Oriental Bay-Owl and a “wok-wok-wok” reported from Rwanda may be this species. Similar Barn Owl and Grass Owl are larger than Congo Bay-Owl, preferring more open areas."
0,Congo Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Riparia congica,https://ebird.org/species/conmar1,"A typical small martin with brown upperparts, pale underparts, and a diffuse gray-brown breast band. Resident and extremely localized, restricted to the Congo River and a handful of its tributaries, breeding colonially in sandbanks. Despite being fairly common, the species’ vocalizations are unknown. Sand Martin is larger than Congo Martin and has a bolder breast band delineating a white throat; Brown-throated Martin has a dark throat."

0,Congo Serpent-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Dryotriorchis spectabilis,https://ebird.org/species/coseag1,"A big-headed but overall medium-sized forest eagle that eats primarily snakes. Can be found at all heights, from the canopy down to near the ground. The long banded tail, brown back with a rufous hind-collar, white breast, and barred flanks make this species unique within its range. Western birds have white throats, while eastern birds have black-spotted throats. Frequently heard calling in the forest, uttering a long series of “HOW, how, HOW, how” caws that are reminiscent of a hornbill. Throughout range, co-occurs with the similar-looking Cassin’s Hawk-Eagle, but Congo Serpent-Eagle is smaller, has a black line down the center of the throat, and appears bigger-headed."
0,Congo Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris congensis,https://ebird.org/species/consun2,"A slim, long-billed sunbird in which males and females are very different.

0,Cordilleran Canastero,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Asthenes modesta,https://ebird.org/species/corcan1,"Widespread and often fairly common in the Andes, mainly in fairly open habitats from scrub to bogs and rocky slopes. Often relatively conspicuous, running on the ground with tail strongly cocked and often dipped, or singing from a prominent rock. Plumage rather plain overall with brownish upperparts and dark-centered, bright rusty tail. Favors more open habitats than Sharp-billed and Canyon Canasteros, which hold their tails more loosely and flip them around vs. being more stiffy cocked and dipped. Also note vocal differences."
0,Cordilleran Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax occidentalis,https://ebird.org/species/corfly,"Small, yellow-olive flycatcher. Brighter yellow than most other Empidonax flycatchers. Look for bold teardrop-shaped eyering that comes to a point behind the eye, and fluffy, peaked crown. Breeds in coniferous forests, often near water; migrants and wintering birds can be found in other wooded or scrubby habitats, but typically stay at relatively high elevations. Essentially identical to Pacific-slope Flycatcher with very subtle vocal differences; identification is usually presumed based on range."
0,Corn Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza calandra,https://ebird.org/species/corbun1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common in open farmland and heathland. Mostly inconspicuous, but male sings from low perch on bush or fence. Lacks white outer tail feathers shown by most buntings.

0,Cryptic Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Microptilotis imitatrix,https://ebird.org/species/grahon5,"A small olive-gray honeyeater with a circular pale yellow cheek patch and a relatively fine bill. Can be confused with Lewin’s Honeyeater and Yellow-spotted Honeyeater, but note the shape of the cheek patch: crescent-shaped on Lewin’s Honeyeater and oval on Yellow-spotted Honeyeater. Adults also have a blue-gray eye while Lewin’s has a bluish eye and Yellow-spotted has a brown eye. Voice is a key ID feature—often a single short note rather than the loud repeated whistle of Yellow-spotted or the rapid staccato machine-gun call of Lewin’s. One of three easily confusable species found in far northern Queensland. Common in many wetter lowland habitats in wetter parts of northern Queensland. Formerly considered conspecific with Graceful Honeyeater, but no overlap in range."
0,Cryptic Treehunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cichlocolaptes mazarbarnetti,https://ebird.org/species/crytre1,"This critically endangered bird was described in 2014, and it tragically may have gone extinct by the time the paper was published. It is known from just two sites in the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas in northeastern Brazil. Plumage is mostly brown with a dark crown, black and buff stripes on the face, and reddish-orange tail. It is very similar to Alagoas Foliage-gleaner, with which it was confused for many years and also possibly extinct. Cryptic Treehunter differs by its larger size, bulkier bill, blacker crown, darker sides to the neck, and different voice. Stays inside dense rainforest in hilly terrain, especially where there are lots of epiphytes and vine tangles. Typical song is a soft rattle followed by a series of burry notes."
0,Cryptic Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Bernieridae,Cryptosylvicola randrianasoloi,https://ebird.org/species/crywar1,"Plain, warbler-like tetraka. Uncommon Madagascar endemic that is found very locally in middle- and high-elevation rainforest. Canopy species that sometimes joins mixed flocks. Often sings from an exposed perch. Song is a series of high, thin notes that fades away. Similar to Rand’s Warbler, but eye-stripe is not as bold, and the color of the upperparts is more olive-green than gray.

The similar Palm Crow has a much shorter bill with extensive feathering on top. The Palm Crow also has a flat, harsh “raaah” unlike the Cuban Crow’s “whih waaa” call with the first note inflected upward and the second note downward. Cuban Crows also have a number of shrieking and harsh burbling noises."
0,Cuban Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Riccordia ricordii,https://ebird.org/species/cubeme1,"A pugnacious hummingbird that feeds on flowers and insects and is sometimes found flycatching. Inhabits a broad range of habitats. Often tame around humans. The long-tailed male is swathed entirely in iridescent green and has a distinctive red base to the bill, except for a white patch below the belly and a white spot behind the eye. The female is metallic green above, dingy white below, and has a relatively long, forked tail. The female Bee Hummingbird is much smaller, shorter billed, shorter tailed, and is iridescent turquoise above unlike the Cuban Emerald. Female Ruby-throated Hummingbirds have shorter, unforked tails with white on the tail tip. Vocalizations include a prolonged jumbled series of high-pitched squeaks and buzzes and a high-pitched but descending “tsee, tsee, tsee, tse, tse.”"

Typically feeds low in dense scrub. Endemic to Cuba and offshore islands. Calls include a repeated “da-JIP,” a rapid squeaky “ji-ji-ji-ji-ji,” and a more classic gnatcatcher “zheee.” Note white face outlined with a thin black line, which readily distinguishes Cuban from Blue-gray Gnatcatcher."
0,Cuban Grassquit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Phonipara canora,https://ebird.org/species/cubgra,"A small flocking bird of scrub and grasslands. Note the dark face (black in males and gray in females) that is surrounded by a swirl of yellow from behind each eye, down the sides of the neck, and across the chest. The male Yellow-faced Grassquit has a passing resemblance, but the throat is yellow and the chest is black. Female Yellow-faced and Black-faced Grassquits are of similar size and color but lack the yellow neck and chest seen on Cuban Grassquits. The call is a sharp musical chip and the song is a rather high-pitched twitter."

0,Cuban Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Progne cryptoleuca,https://ebird.org/species/cubmar,"A graceful aerial feeder found over a wide variety of open habitats, especially near water, including marshes and towns. Often chooses exposed perches including power and telephone lines in villages. Commonly found in flocks of up to twenty birds, sometimes mixing with other swallows and martins. The adult male is entirely glossy purple-blue and is inseparable in the field from male Purple Martins. The male Caribbean Martin can be distinguished by its bright white belly. Female and immature Cuban Martins resemble females and immatures of both Purple and Caribbean Martin. Purple Martin in such plumages can be identified by a scaly breast pattern and often fine streaks on the belly, which is lacking on female and immature Cuban Martins. Female Cuban Martins are probably not safely separable from Caribbean Martin, though on average the Cuban Martin has more restricted brown on chest. Note that Caribbean and Purple Martins are not present in this species’ range from March to September, which can help eliminate confusing species. Calls include a harsh “churr,” a buzzy “zwick-zwick,” and a musical buzzy burbling."
0,Cuban Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus melanopsis,https://ebird.org/species/graori2,"A sleek forest bird that sometimes ventures into gardens and parks in search of flowers and fruit; prefers areas with palms. The adult is dressed in black except for its yellow rump and shoulders. No similar species occur within its range.

Easily distinguished from other species in its range by its color, slim build, and long pointed tail. In overflight appears green with red on forewing. Flight call is shrill and squeaky; notes of each bird often given singly or in couplets. When perched, calls are typically quiet with a murmuring quality."
0,Cuban Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus caribaeus,https://ebird.org/species/cubpew1,"An active small flycatcher of open woodlands and scrub. It is most similar to Eastern Wood-Pewee and migrant flycatchers of the genus Empidonax; best distinguished from these species by the bold white crescent behind the eye. Often flicks tail upwards once after landing. Its song is “Tswee-ooooooo,” with the first part explosive and the second a lazy descending whistle. On the Bahamas, the song often has two or three quick notes added afterwards. Call is a sharp “peep-peep-peep.”"
0,Cuban Pygmy-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium siju,https://ebird.org/species/cupowl1,"A very small, tame owl of wooded habitats that is active both day and night. Depending on attitude, its staring yellow eyes and prominent arched white eyebrows can impart cuteness or ferocity. Often found perched with tail cocked, and when flushed, typically flies only a short distance on rounded wings. Occurs in two color types, gray and rust. Song is a low whistled “whuh” or “hoo” given in a slow series. Other vocalizations include a high, thin whistled “tsee, tsee-tsee-tsee-tsee-tsee” that grows progressively louder, and a series of high squeaks. No similar species within its range."
0,Cuban Solitaire,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Myadestes elisabeth,https://ebird.org/species/cubsol1,"A medium-sized inhabitant of wet forests in mountains and foothills. Though subtle, its appearance is unique within its range. Note the subdued brown upperparts and soft gray underparts combined with a bold eyering, distinct dark whisker, and white outer tail feathers. Can be mistaken for a flycatcher, as it habitually sits motionless, except for sallies after insects or fruit, but no flycatcher in its range has a similar facial pattern or white outer tail feathers. Famed for its remarkable song, by which it is often first detected; a variable combination of loud shrills and flutelike notes."
0,Cuban Tody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Todidae,Todus multicolor,https://ebird.org/species/cubtod1,"A small, gemlike, woodland species that is usually found in pairs. The rather large head, long bill, and short tail create a unique profile. Also note its shimmering green upperparts and red throat and sides. No similar species occur within its range. It usually hunts from low-to-middle level perches, sitting nearly still before leaping upwards to snatch prey from twigs and leaves. Vocalizations include a loud “chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk,” uttered at a rate of about seven to ten notes per second, with each burst consisting of one to ten notes; bursts often come in rapid succession."
0,Cuban Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Priotelus temnurus,https://ebird.org/species/cubtro1,"A splendid medium-sized inhabitant of woodlands; often found in pairs. Its iridescent blue-green back, smooth gray chest, and brilliant red belly easily distinguish it from all other species in range. Usually sits motionless near the middle level of the forest, but when feeding (typically on flowers and fruit) hovers conspicuously. Often found by its loud calls, which are somewhat varied. One common call is a “cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu,” often accelerating; another is a resonant quavering “cu-u-low,” given several times in succession."
0,Cuban Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo gundlachii,https://ebird.org/species/cubvir1,"A small, slow-moving species that favors thickets and brush along forest edges and in scrublands. Typically found in pairs; sometimes joins mixed-species flocks with warblers and other vireos. Cuban Vireos have a “bulging eye” appearance created by the white crescent behind the eye and the dull yellowish spot in front of its eye. Also note its hefty bill, weak wingbars, and dull red eye. The similar Thick-billed Vireo has strong wingbars, a yellow spot in front of the eye, and darker eyes. The song is “chweee-ch-byuuu,” with the first note upslurred and last note downslurred. Its calls include a harsh “zzzhhh.”"
0,Cuckoo-roller,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Leptosomiformes,Leptosomidae,Leptosomus discolor,https://ebird.org/species/cuckoo1,"A large, big-headed, short-legged bird that is very odd in almost every way, especially in the position of the eye near the top of the head. Males have a pale head and underparts and a colorful iridescent back. Females are rufous brown with heavy spotting below. Found in all forest types, and sometimes in adjacent scrub and plantations. Often perches and feeds in the canopy, though rarely on an emergent branch. Males and pairs frequently make soaring display flights, constantly giving incredibly loud and persistent three-part wailing calls. Much larger than Broad-billed Roller, with a dark bill. Looks raptor-like, but has a huge head, small bill, and less powerful wingbeats."
0,Cundinamarca Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria kaestneri,https://ebird.org/species/cunant1,"A rather plain antpitta known only from a small area of Colombia’s eastern Andes, southeast of Bogotá. Plumage is dull brown with small white streaks on the underparts, a slightly paler belly, and a faint eyering. Distinguished from Tawny Antpitta by its much darker plumage, streaked (not scaled) underparts, and habitat preferences. Inhabits cloud forest understory, and mostly stays on the ground, though may come up to a low perch to sing. Song is three short whistles that ascend slightly in pitch."
0,Curlew Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris ferruginea,https://ebird.org/species/cursan,"Medium-sized wader with a long, slightly downcurved bill. Slightly larger than Dunlin, with longer and finer bill, longer legs. In flight note large white rump patch. Breeding plumage deep rusty on head and body (like Red Knot).

0,Damara Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sternula balaenarum,https://ebird.org/species/damter2,"A very small, short-tailed tern of coastal waters. It often flies slowly on rapidly-beating wings with its head angled downwards, before hovering and plunge-diving to catch small fish. When breeding, it has a complete black skull cap and bill; when not breeding the front of the forehead turns white. It breeds on barren gravel plains and dunes but is most frequently encountered foraging over estuaries, lagoons, and near shore. Its strident “tsit-tsit” call is higher-pitched than those of other terns. In non-breeding plumage, the very similar Little Tern has contrasting paler rump and tail, while Damara Tern’s back, rump, and tail are all the same shade of pale gray."
0,Cloud-scraping Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola dambo,https://ebird.org/species/clscis1,"Small cisticola that is pale and buffy below, and dark on the back. The crown, back of the neck, and back are heavily streaked. Found in seasonally flooded grassland. A high-pitched, multi-note piping song is given on the wing in a flight display. Very similar to Wing-snapping and Pale-crowned Cisticolas, but longer-tailed than both, and further distinguished from Pale-crowned in breeding plumage by the streaked crown. Also similar to Zitting and Desert Cisticolas, but has a different voice, and is darker on the back."

0,Dark Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis crypta,https://ebird.org/species/darbat1,"Males have the typical batis pattern of black, white, and gray. Females have a more unusual pattern, with rufous in the wing, rufous on the throat, and a variable amount of rufous on the breast. Both sexes have orange or reddish eyes. Found at middle levels and in the canopy of forest at low and middle elevations, often in pairs. Very similar to Short-tailed Batis, but there is no known overlap in range. Males are similar to Chinspot and Pale Batises, but are distinguished by the darker eye and shorter tail. Females are distinctive. The song is variable, but is usually a long, slow series of identical low-pitched tooting notes, sometimes given along with raspy “chugaree” calls."
0,Dark Chanting-Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Melierax metabates,https://ebird.org/species/dacgos1,"A tall, long-tailed, slaty-gray hawk with pink-orange legs and bill base. The flight feathers and wing tips are dark on both the upper and under wings, creating a uniformly dark wing pattern in flight. Pairs inhabit broadleaved woodland and well-wooded savanna. Chanting-goshawks give a strong, gull-like “kleeeu” call, hence their name. Dark Chanting-Goshawk always has a gray-barred rump, while other chanting-goshawks are paler, prefer drier habitats, and have unbarred white rumps. Eastern Chanting-Goshawk has yellow skin at the base of the bill. Pale Chanting-Goshawk has pale inner flight feathers and dark wing tips, creating a very contrasting wing pattern."
0,Dark Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus lugubris,https://ebird.org/species/darpew1,"The only all-dark crested flycatcher in range. Entirely sooty-gray, only slightly paler on throat and belly. More obvious crest than other pewees. Sexes alike. Usually seen singly, perched conspicuously at the forest edge or in a clearing. Listen for “pip” call notes."
0,Dartford Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca undata,https://ebird.org/species/darwar1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common in dense scrubby habitats, especially heathland with gorse. Skulking and difficult to see well, although when singing in spring may perch atop a bush, the long tail often held slightly cocked. Plumage rather dark overall, grayish above and dull wine-red below; note narrow red eyering and fairly bright yellowish legs. No similar species in most of its range."
0,Darwin's Nothura,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothura darwinii,https://ebird.org/species/darnot1,"Quail-like tinamou found in a variety of open habitats including grassland, farmland, and steppe. It occupies high elevations in the northern part of its range, but can be found down to near sea level at its southern limit. Small size (compared to most tinamous) and buff belly and streaks help to identify it. Very similar to Spotted Nothura, and in the area of overlap it is usually not possible to separate them in the field; in this region Darwin’s Nothura tends to be found at higher elevations. Vocalizations include a long, ringing trill and a slow series of piping notes."
0,Daurian Jackdaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus dauuricus,https://ebird.org/species/daujac1,"Small stout crow; often seen in large flocks, sometimes with other crows.

0,Davison's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus intensior,https://ebird.org/species/davlew1,"Small, brightly-colored leaf warbler. Yellowish green above and pale below, with bright yellow brow stripes, a pale crown stripe, and a bicolored bill (dark above, orange below). Has two wingbars, of which upper can be quite pale or absent. Note white undertail and distinct behavior of flicking both wings at the same time (Blyth’s, Claudia’s, and Hartert’s leaf warblers flick their wings alternatingly). More extensively yellow and with a stronger, more contrasting head pattern than Blyth’s and Emei leaf warblers, and lacks the bright rump patch of “Pallas’s-type” leaf warblers. Closely related Kloss’s Leaf Warbler is extremely similar; look for Davison’s brighter and more extensively white undertail coverts. Breeds in deciduous broadleaved and mixed hill and montane forest; descends into forested foothills in the non-breeding season. Song is short and sweet: “wih-chew-chee wih-chew-chee-wih”.

0,Drakensberg Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia hypoxantha,https://ebird.org/species/drapri1,"An active warbler with a long graduated tail that is sometimes cocked. It is warm brown above and yellowish below with fine streaks mostly restricted to the chest and lacking on the throat and belly. Pairs frequent grassland and scrub near rivers, or forest edge, where they are active gleaners of insects, occasionally hopping on the ground. The typical song is a reedy piping “kli” note repeated 4-15 times, with scratchy buzzing notes interspersed. The similar Karoo Prinia differs from the Drakensberg Prinia by having colder upperparts, whiter underparts, and more extensive streaks and blotches on the underparts that often extend to the throat and belly."
0,Drakensberg Rockjumper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chaetopidae,Chaetops aurantius,https://ebird.org/species/orbroc1,"A striking, gregarious bird that bounces about on rocky mountain slopes and crags in grassland habitat. The sexes differ: the male has an orange belly and rump, a black throat, and a white moustache; the female is duller, mostly buff underneath with a streaked chest. Pairs and small groups hop about on the ground and forage for insects between tussocks and shrubs. In territorial display, the male spreads and half-cocks his white-tipped black tail and gives a loud, rollicking “tseeur-rip, tseeur-rip, tseeur-rip” and other piping calls. The similar Cape Rockjumper differs from the Drakensberg Rockjumper by having darker chestnut underparts and preferring fynbos habitat."

Combination of bill shape and unstreaked upperparts separate it from other woodcreepers. It is one of several species formerly known as Lineated Woodcreeper, all of which look very similar but have different voices and ranges. Duida Woodcreeper is known from eastern Ecuador, northeastern Peru, northwestern Brazil, eastern Venezuela, and near the southern and eastern borders of Colombia. Song is a series of whistles that decreases in pitch and accelerates near the end. Inhabits canopy of lowland and foothill rainforest, and often joins mixed-species flocks."
0,Dulit Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus harterti,https://ebird.org/species/dulfro1,"Large frogmouth of Borneo’s central mountains. Inhabits foothill forest (typically 600–1230 m). Heavyset, with a whiskered face and bright white spots on the wings. Similar Large Frogmouth is generally found at lower elevations; Dulit has broader (as opposed to Large’s sharply triangular) white wing spots, strong pale barring on the throat, and overall darker coloration. Song is a low, resonant, melancholy-sounding “hooooo’m”; call consists of barks, typically given in pairs: “woo’WUP!”."
0,Dune Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Calendulauda erythrochlamys,https://ebird.org/species/dunlar3,"A medium-sized lark that has a rounded head lacking a crest, a slightly decurved bill, a plain face pattern, and diffuse pale streaking that is restricted to the breast. Upperparts coloration is mostly pale sandy-pink to buff, often matching the prevailing soil color in the region. Pairs are restricted to the sand dunes of the Namib desert, where this species is often one of the few birds present. The male sings from dunes, and in spring it performs an aerial flight display 10-30 meters above the ground, with deep wingbeats, fluttering, and dangling legs. The song is a distinctive rolling set of dry raspy introductory clicks, followed by whistles and trills. The Dune Lark’s range abuts with the range of the similar but larger Barlow’s Lark, which is more richly colored and has bold brown breast streaks."
0,Dunlin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris alpina,https://ebird.org/species/dunlin,"Small, plump shorebird with droopy bill. Breeding plumage is distinctive with rufous or brown back and black belly. In fall and winter, plain grayish-brown above with white belly. Often in large flocks on mudflats and beaches, sometimes mixing with other shorebirds. Breeds on Arctic tundra; winters on coastlines throughout the Northern Hemisphere; typically less common inland. A late migrant, especially in fall; lingers longer at higher latitudes than most other small shorebirds. Very similar to Curlew Sandpiper in nonbreeding plumage, but Dunlin is more compact, shorter-winged and shorter-legged, and darker. Droopy bill might recall Western Sandpiper, but Dunlin is larger and darker. Also compare with Purple Sandpiper, which is even darker and more spotted and has orange legs. Listen for loud, slightly buzzy “dzeer!” calls."
0,Dunn's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Eremalauda dunni,https://ebird.org/species/dunlar1,"A chunky, large-billed lark of desolate sandy deserts and open arid plains in northern Africa. Plain sandy-brown above and paler below, with faint and indistinct white markings on the face. Also note the pinkish bill and the inky black outer tail feathers, most apparent in flight. Runs about on the ground, stopping abruptly. Found singly or in pairs when breeding, gathering in larger groups only during the non-breeding season. The song is a sequence of whistles and dry notes, given both from the ground and in song flight. Generally similar to other dry-country larks such as Desert Lark, Bar-tailed Lark, and Kordofan Lark, but combination of unmarked upperparts, black outer tail feathers, and the uniformly pink and bulbous bill is diagnostic."
0,Dunnock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Prunellidae,Prunella modularis,https://ebird.org/species/dunnoc1,"Fairly common to common but unobtrusive, found in a variety of open scrubby and wooded habitats, from low bleak heathland to parks, gardens, and farmland with hedges. Usually seen as singles or pairs, hopping on lawns or paths with distinctive shuffling gait. Appearance rather drab but distinctive: note slender, thrush-like bill (not stout, like superficially similar sparrows), blue-gray head sides, streaked back. Undistinguished, slightly tinny, rambling song has an even, warbled cadence; distinctive when learned."
0,Dupont's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Chersophilus duponti,https://ebird.org/species/duplar1,"The same size as Eurasian Skylark, with a longer and more slender down-curved bill and small head. Cryptically-plumaged upperparts with pale feather edges, a heavily streaked breast, and a white belly. North African race paler still than Iberian birds. Found in natural steppes and semi-deserts, walking with its head up, looking tall. Fiendishly hard to see. Prefers to run when disturbed rather than fly. Melancholic song delivered high in the sky at dusk and dawn."
0,Dusky Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacroides tyrannina,https://ebird.org/species/dusant1,"This skulking species lives in humid tropical lowlands, favoring thickets and tangles at forest edges and along streams.

0,Dusky Broadbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Eurylaimidae,Corydon sumatranus,https://ebird.org/species/dusbro1,"Strange-looking bird with predominantly dark plumage, a pale “bib,” and an enormous, deep-set pink bill. Its long body and bulky build makes it seem more like an aberrant roller than a large broadbill. Forages like a roller, frequently making forays from a perch, but much more social, often being encountered in noisy medium-sized groups. Found in forests from lowlands up into the highlands, typically in wetter areas. Gives many different calls, including an ascending series of squeaky notes, as well as mellow single notes and less pleasant-sounding croaks and rattles."
0,Dusky Crag-Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Ptyonoprogne concolor,https://ebird.org/species/duscrm1,"An overall dark brown swallow with paler underparts. It has a square tail with a white spot on each tail feather, making a white speckled band of sorts. Young birds have paler underparts.

Could be confused with Great Thrush, which is a similar size and color, but note dark legs and bill. Also focus on the Piha’s shape, with its long tail, short bill, and round head. Occurs in humid cloud forest, where it typically perches inconspicuously in the middle to upper levels of forest. Often found around fruiting trees."
0,Dusky Purpletuft,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Iodopleura fusca,https://ebird.org/species/duspur1,"Small, uncommon cotinga; usually seen perched in the uppermost bare branches of a high tree. At a distance, appears mostly black with a conspicuous white line down center of breast. Poorly known; found in tall rainforest and lower-stature forests on white sand where it is often seen in pairs or small groups. Feeds on fruit. Size, shape, and habit of perching in bare treetops recall the much more common Swallow-winged Puffbird, which lacks purpletuft’s white breast stripe. Calls are soft, indistinct whistles."
0,Dusky Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Melanodryas vittata,https://ebird.org/species/dusrob1,"Medium-sized, rather long-tailed Australian robin, both sexes plain brown overall.

0,Eastern Subalpine Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca cantillans,https://ebird.org/species/easwar1,"A small, slim warbler with a long tail. Breeding males are distinctive, with gray upperparts contrasting with a puffy rufous throat and breast, and a bold white moustache mark. Female and non-breeding males resemble a washed-out version of the breeding male, with much less rufous below. Typically found in scrubby, dense bushy habitats, but also in more open woodland and savanna. Sings from the tops of bushes, giving a rattling and loud sequence of notes. The calls are dry “trkk” or ""trk-tek"" notes, which are also incorporated into the song. Very similar to Moltoni’s Warbler, and best separated by the call (single or subtly doubled notes rather than dry rattles); breeding male is also richer rufous below. Also very similar to Western Subalpine Warbler, but call is subtly different: Eastern’s is slightly softer and tends to have two syllables. Breeding males are separated visually from Western by having more white on the belly, a darker face, and a broader white moustache."

Males have yellow forecrown and belly contrasting with dark throat; females mostly dull yellow and green. Usually in pairs or small groups; may sit motionless for long periods before flying off into the distance. Found in a variety of forest types including coastal and savanna forest; usually in the canopy and at fruiting trees. Frequently heard call a plaintive, doubled whistle. Male is very similar to Purple-throated Euphonia but more richly colored below; female is similar to Violaceous Euphonia and best distinguished by attendant males."
0,Finsch's Francolin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Scleroptila finschi,https://ebird.org/species/finfra2,"Medium-sized francolin with a mostly gray body, rufous head, and white throat. Found locally on the ground in grassy habitats including savanna, montane grassland, and woodland. Usually in pairs or small groups. Typical vocalization is a duet of “chur-it-cheer” phrases and a repeated single note. Somewhat similar to Red-winged Francolin, but duller, without a strongly marked face or heavily striped breast."
0,Finsch's Imperial-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula finschii,https://ebird.org/species/fiipig1,"A relatively plump and squat imperial-pigeon with a deep chestnut underside, a bright green back and wings, a pale pinkish chest, a gray neck, and a white eye-ring. White tail band sandwiched between two black tail bands is diagnostic. An unobtrusive pigeon that often sits motionless in the canopy of old-growth forest. Rarely seen flying above the canopy. Juvenile Red-knobbed Imperial Pigeon could cause confusion, but lacks the bold tail pattern. Voice of Finsch’s little known, but the species has been heard giving a long gruff coo reportedly similar to a steam engine’s whistle."
0,Finsch's Pygmy-Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Micropsitta finschii,https://ebird.org/species/fippar1,"A tiny, mostly green parrot, paler green below, with a yellowish undertail and blue uppertail. Some have a bluish cast to the crown. Male has a small orange patch on the belly. Prefers mostly primary forest, but also occurs in secondary habitats up to around 1000 meters of elevation, though often much lower. Red-breasted Pygmy-Parrot differs in its diagnostic pale face, red in males, with strong blue collar and red belly in males, limited blue cap in females. Similar Bismarck Hanging-Parrot is longer-tailed and has blue underwings in flight. Finsch’s call is a typically high-pitched “tsit” or “tsee.”"
0,Finsch's Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe finschii,https://ebird.org/species/finwhe1,"A medium-sized elegant wheatear with long wings and long legs. Strong sexual dimorphism: male is black and white with a white back, while female is gray-brown with gray upperparts and an increasing amount of dark feathering on throat as they mature. In all plumages note the narrow, evenly-broad black terminal tail band. Breeds on high, barren, rocky mountain slopes. In winter often descends to plains, steppes, and even semi-desert. Song is a mix of harsh scratches and musical whistles; often given from a prominent perch."
0,Fiordland Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes pachyrhynchus,https://ebird.org/species/fiopen1,"Tall penguin endemic to New Zealand, with distinct broad yellow eyebrow that spreads out and sags down the neck. The orange bill has no bare skin at the base. Breeds and molts in dense coastal forest, thick shrubs, and caves along the southwestern coast of the South Island and Stewart Island. Calls vary from emphatic trumpeting to a low-pitched growl or hiss. Look for white stripes on cheek which can be splayed out when threatened. Cheek stripes and lack of bare skin at base of bill help distinguish this species from Snares and Erect-crested Penguins."
0,Firethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope pectardens,https://ebird.org/species/fireth1,"Male is stunning, with a metallic blue back, a black mask extending down to the shoulder, and a burning flame-orange throat and breast. Female is plain brown and very difficult to distinguish from female Indian Blue Robin (which generally breeds at lower altitudes than Firethroat) and Siberian Blue Robin (which overlaps with Firethroat only on migration); look out for the female Firethroat’s relatively brighter white throat, darker underparts, and lack of scaling on the breast. The species is shy, keeping to the undergrowth, but will emerge into the open to sing; song is repetitive and pleasant, with imitations and deeper notes thrown in. Breeds in dense, low montane vegetation; winters in similar habitat in lower foothills."
0,Fiscal Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis silens,https://ebird.org/species/fisfly1,"A large pied flycatcher that is most commonly mistaken for Southern Fiscal. However, the upright stance and slender unhooked bill are distinctive flycatcher traits, and the pattern of white in the flight feathers and basal windows of the tail is diagnostic. The female is duller than the male. Singles and pairs frequent a variety of open country habitats, including gardens, parks, shrubland, and woodland, where they perch conspicuously and hawk insect prey from the ground or aerially. The species is mostly silent but occasionally it utters a thin high-pitched song. The similar Southern Fiscal is more robust than the Fiscal Flycatcher, with a chunky hook-tipped bill, a white V-pattern on the shoulders, and a long tail with white outer feathers."
0,Fischer's Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Phyllastrephus fischeri,https://ebird.org/species/fisgre1,"Typically dull olive-brown mid-sized greenbul with a long bill, white throat, and reddish tail. Has a whitish eye, and usually shows pale crescents above and below the eye. Found in the thick undergrowth of forest and lush woodland at low elevations. Usually in small groups. The calls are low, gravelly “chrrr” notes, delivered in quick sequence, often by a whole group together. Somewhat similar to Gray-olive Greenbul, but larger, with a darker bill and legs. Similar to brownbuls, but separated by the pale eye and more olive-green coloration on the back."
0,Fischer's Lovebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Agapornis fischeri,https://ebird.org/species/fislov1,"A colorful lovebird of East African savanna that is also found in woodland, cultivated areas, and towns. Note the green back, the broad yellow collar, the orange face, and the red bill. The flight is fast and direct, on twitching wingbeats. Usually found in flocks that can be quite large. Similar to Yellow-collared Lovebird, but easily separated by the orange rather than black head. However, hybrids showing a mix of the two species’ traits are now common, especially in Kenya and along the coast. The common call is a scratchy “sveet.”"
0,Fischer's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis fischeri,https://ebird.org/species/fissta1,"An unusual gray-and-white starling of dry country. Note the gray hood, pale eye, whitish crown, and gray rump. The large white patches on the underwing are distinctive in flight. Found in dry savanna, in cultivated areas, and around human habitation, usually in flocks. Most similar to Wattled Starling, but has a gray rather than white rump, a pale eye, and a distinct gray hood. The most common call is a rising, slurred whistle, sometimes given in a long series."
0,Fischer's Turaco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Musophagiformes,Musophagidae,Tauraco fischeri,https://ebird.org/species/fistur1,"A spectacular turaco with iridescent dark blue wings and tail and a green head and breast. Note the ornate markings on the head: a moderate crest that is white-and-orange along the back, and white stripes above and below the eye. Like all turacos, shows large crimson wing patches in flight. Found in coastal forest and woodland and along forest edge. Acts like a typical turaco, bouncing through the trees and flying occasionally with short bursts of wingbeats and long glides. Overall similar to Livingstone’s and Hartlaub’s Turacos, but easily separated by the orange in the crest. Call is a gruff, accelerating series of “kow” notes."
0,Fish Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus ossifragus,https://ebird.org/species/fiscro,"A relatively small, glossy crow. Very difficult to separate from American Crow by appearance; look for Fish Crow’s slightly more tapered wings, quicker wingbeats, and shorter legs. Most easily identified by voice, a nasal “eh-uh” or single nasal caws. Mostly restricted to the southeastern U.S., especially along the coast, but range expanding slightly northward and inland in recent years. Often near water, but also seems especially fond of fast-food parking lots and dumpsters."
0,Flame Bowerbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Sericulus ardens,https://ebird.org/species/flabow2,"A very brightly-colored bowerbird of lowland and foothill forests in southern New Guinea. Male unmistakeable. Bright yellow body with black wing edge and tail. Scarlet from the head down to the shoulders and back, resembling a headscarf.

Calls, a downward squeal “kwiiiiiiuuu!” and some harsh rasping."
0,Flame Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Petroica phoenicea,https://ebird.org/species/flarob1,"Large Australian robin. Male slaty gray above, with gray head and chin and small white spot above the bill. Breast and belly a bright orange-red. Black upperwing shows extensive white panels. Female brown above, paler brown below; darker wing with pale panels. In Tasmania, similar female Dusky Robin lacks pale wing panels. Forages in small flocks on the ground in farmland, grasslands, parks, and other open habitats in southeastern Australia and Tasmania."
0,Flamecrest,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Regulidae,Regulus goodfellowi,https://ebird.org/species/flamec1,"Tiny, active songbird with distinctive black-and-white head pattern. Olive above, white below, with yellow wash on sides and rump and white wingbars; adult male’s vivid red-orange crest especially visible when raised. Inhabits montane coniferous forests and more open, scrubby areas with stunted bushes and evergreen growth. Feeds restlessly on small branches, frequently both gleaning and hovering. Song a somewhat strident series of high-pitched thin “tsi” notes; calls similar to song elements."
0,Flaming Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga flagrans,https://ebird.org/species/flasun1,"A small bird of forest and edge from the lowlands to low elevations in the mountains on Luzon and Catanduanes. Has a fairly long, curved bill, olive upperparts, and a yellowish upper belly. Male has a blackish tail, face, throat, and chest, with green iridescence on the forecrown and purple on the throat.

Mostly sluggish and easily overlooked unless singing; tends to stay within cover rather than coming out into open areas. Resembles a Myiarchus flycatcher (especially Dusky-capped), but note the pale spectacles, faint dusky streaks on the breast (or flammulations ) and extensive cinnamon edging to the wing feathers."
0,Flammulated Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Psiloscops flammeolus,https://ebird.org/species/flaowl,"Unique among small owls with entirely dark eyes. Finely vermiculated gray plumage looks stained with bits of rust. Surprisingly common in montane forest dominated by pine, often mixed with aspen; one survey in Utah found 47 calling individuals along just five miles of road! Strictly nocturnal; most easily detected when singing low, muffled hoots. Feeds mostly on insects. Highly migratory; moves southward into Mexico for the winter."
0,Flammulated Treehunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Thripadectes flammulatus,https://ebird.org/species/flatre1,"Uncommon medium-sized brownish bird of Andean montane forest from Venezuela through Ecuador and just barely into Peru. Distinctive among treehunters with its bold buffy streaking covering the entire head, back, and body. Rufous wings and tail. Sexes alike. Usually found singly or in pairs moving furtively through the understory of forest, often around bamboo, from around 2,200–3,500 m. Does not typically follow mixed-species flocks."
0,Flappet Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra rufocinnamomea,https://ebird.org/species/flalar1,"A medium-sized, stocky lark with a small bill, a streaky head and back, and scalloped edges to the wing feathers that give it a scaly-backed appearance. The plumage varies geographically, with rusty to dark brown upperparts, buffy underparts, and a reddish wing panel visible in flight and when perched. Pairs prefer grassy savanna and open woodland, where they forage for insects by running furtively between clumps of grass and shrubs. The male gives a distinctive aerial display that involves the mechanical “clapping” of the wings beneath the body. He rises to 50-100 meters in the air and slowly circles his territory, giving a series of short (one-second) bursts of wing-clapping, typically rendered “prrrrrt, prrrrrt, prrrrt….” The may be accompanied by a simple canary-like song “cheeroo-weee.” The similar Rufous-naped Lark is larger, with a completely different display."
0,Flavescent Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus flavescens,https://ebird.org/species/flabul1,"Brownish-yellow bulbul with a faint white eyebrow and a weakly tufted crest. Roams about in pairs or small groups, sometimes associating with other species. Prefers open forest and edge habitat over dense mature forests. Often found in scrubbier, less pristine habitats than other bulbuls in its range, though tends not to occur in cities as readily as Red-vented and Red-whiskered Bulbuls; a regular visitor of rural gardens and farm edges. Simple song consists of alternating sharp whistles, warbled notes, and buzzy gurgling. Also gives harsh low buzzing calls."
0,Flavescent Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiophobus flavicans,https://ebird.org/species/flafly2,"A relatively drab olive-yellow flycatcher with indistinct tawny wingbars (sometimes nearly lacking) and yellowish spectacles.

0,Flightless Cormorant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Nannopterum harrisi,https://ebird.org/species/flicor1,"Brown, aquatic bird with brilliant blue eyes. Tiny, stunted wings look almost comical and seem out-of-place on such a large bird. Endemic to Galápagos (where it is the only cormorant), and restricted to rocky coastlines of Isabela and Fernandina islands. Breeds throughout the year in small colonies. Often seen carrying large clumps of seaweed, which it uses to build its nest."
0,Flock Bronzewing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Phaps histrionica,https://ebird.org/species/flobro1,"Large desert pigeon, typically observed as fast-flying flocks coming in to drink in the morning or evening in arid and semi-arid inland Northern Australia. Plain brown above, plain gray below. Male has black-and-white patterned head, in female and juvenile a more muted brown-and-white pattern. Upperwings plain brown, with plain gray outer wing; similar Common Bronzewing has a metallic wing panel."

Endemic to Galápagos. Now found only on two tiny islets (Gardner and Campeón) off the coast of Floreana Island, it is the only species of mockingbird in its range. Tourists are not allowed to land on these islets, so the birds are usually seen from a boat while they are perched up on cacti or small trees."
0,Flores Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus florensis,https://ebird.org/species/flocro1,"An entirely black crow confined to the island of Flores. Found in small, vocal parties within forest in lowlands and hills. Overlaps with Large-billed Crow, and similarly large-billed, but Flores Crow is smaller-bodied with a relatively smaller bill, and lacks the pronounced steep forehead characteristic of Large-billed Crow. Flores Crow is also a forest species, avoiding open habitats, and has a distinctive voice. Vocalizations are odd for a crow, including babylike, whining, high-pitched “waa” and “we-we-we” calls, the latter sometimes followed by a deep “kyop.” Also gives high “kraaa” notes, a throaty, disyllabic “kwiyou,” and other gurgling sounds."
0,Flores Green-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Treron floris,https://ebird.org/species/flgpig1,"A small, largely green pigeon with bold, scattered pale markings on its wings. Adults show largely pale bills while immatures have dark bills. Small groups found in varied habitats with trees, from forests to open woodlands. In most of its range it is the only Treron green-pigeon, but where it overlaps with Pink-necked Green-Pigeon, note the extensive pale markings on the wing of Flores Green-Pigeon and the absence of a pink-orange breast patch. Song is a series of soft whistles, “woo-wo-OW,” rising at end. Also gives harsher guttural notes."
0,Flores Monarch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Symposiachrus sacerdotum,https://ebird.org/species/flomon1,"A small gray-and white songbird with a black mask and chin and a bright white undertail. Upperparts slate-gray and underparts clean white. Very local, restricted to the island of Flores. Found singly or in pairs in the understory of forested hills, where it often joins mixed-species flocks. Lack of peach wash on the breast separates it from Spectacled Monarch. Song is a series of repeated “weee-weee-weee-weee” notes, with a rise in pitch near the end. Also gives scratchy “churr” notes."
0,Flores Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus alfredi,https://ebird.org/species/flsowl1,"A small owl with yellow eyes, a pale bill, an unmarked rufous face and ear tufts, a pale forehead, mainly rufous upperparts with prominent white spots in the wings, and a faintly-scaled pale grayish underside. Juvenile is largely pale rufous, with little barring but strong tail bands. Inhabits montane forest on Flores. Distinguished from larger Wallace’s and Moluccan Scops-Owls by rufous appearance, pale bill, lack of prominent dark facial border, and absence of bold streaking on underparts. Song is a distinctive crake-like, stuttering “da-da-da-da-da-da-da,” wavering in pitch."
0,Florida Scrub-Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma coerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/flsjay,"Bold, blue-and-gray jay of oak scrub in central Florida. Juveniles have browner head and back than adults. Lacks crest and patterning on the wings and tail seen on Blue Jay. Very social, staying in close family groups to raise young. Readily hops on the ground while searching for food. Unique scrubby habitat must burn periodically in order to remain appropriate for Florida Scrub-Jays. Classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act."
0,Flutist Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Microcerculus ustulatus,https://ebird.org/species/fluwre1,"Tiny, mouse-like bird of tepui forest understory. Entirely dark rufous-brown with a stubby tail. Found only in humid, mossy forest on tepui slopes, mostly above 1000 meters, where it is difficult to see, staying close to the ground as it crawls over roots, rocks, and large branches. Usually encountered alone and does not follow mixed-species flocks. Most easily detected by its extraordinary song: a variable series of short, pure whistles, rising and falling but usually ending with several notes on the same pitch; humanlike and easily imitated. May pop into view in response to imitation or playback, bobbing nervously before disappearing. Could be confused with Tepui Wren, but is darker brown overall and lacks buffy eyebrow."
0,Fluttering Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus gavia,https://ebird.org/species/flushe1,"A small dark-brown shearwater with a white belly and a dusky patch under its wings along with dark markings on the inner wing visible during flight. A brown cap expands over the eye and runs down the back of the neck, blurring into the white chin and breast. Name is derived from distinctive low and fast “fluttering” flight with rapid bursts of wingbeats. Often seen feeding in flocks off the northern and eastern North Island and in the Cook Strait region. Easily confused with Hutton’s Shearwater where habitats overlap on the Cook Strait. Hutton’s is slightly larger with little white showing on the chin and more extensive gray armpit smudging. Little Shearwater also occurs in northern waters but is smaller, with white extending through or above the eye."
0,Fly River Grassbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Poodytes albolimbatus,https://ebird.org/species/flrgra1,"A fairly small bird of marshes in the Trans-Fly of New Guinea. Best seen by boat. Rufous crown, rump and upper tail, whitish underparts with buffy flanks, heavily streaked orange-brown back and black wing feathers edged with white. Inquisitive and often keeps its tail cocked and wings drooped. Similar to Tawny and Little Grassbirds, but Fly River has an unstreaked, rufous crown, and is smaller than Tawny. Voice, a monotone whistle and a harsh “chat!”."
0,Flying Steamer-Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Tachyeres patachonicus,https://ebird.org/species/flystd1,"A large, heavily built duck that is fairly common along rocky seacoasts and on lakes near the coast; also local and uncommon on larger lakes farther inland. Despite the name, rarely seen in flight; more often seen thrashing through the water like an old paddle steamer boat, hence the name. Male’s bill is mostly orange, while the female’s bill is mostly greenish. Plumage of both sexes is duller gray or brownish gray compared to Flightless Steamer-Duck; the two species sometimes occur together, but Flightless tends to be warier."
0,Foothill Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis olallai,https://ebird.org/species/fooela1,"Inconspicuous flycatcher of Andean cloud forest. Plumage varies geographically but always has a gray head, olive back, and yellow spots on wings that may or may not form distinct wingbars. Underparts are bright yellow in most of its range.

It usually looks dull brown and featureless, though it may show an olive tinge and paler chin if seen in bright light. Sexes look alike. It is one of several species that together were formerly known as Thrush-like Schiffornis; they differ in range, voice, and elevation. Often best identified by its frequently given song: a wavering whistle that seems out of tune, rising and falling in pitch several times. Stays in the forest understory, and often perches motionless for long periods."
0,Foothill Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/foosco1,"Small, cryptically patterned, yellow-eyed owl of forest in lowlands and foothills, where it tends to stay well hidden in the understory. Occurs on the east slope of the Andes and into the lowlands, as far south as Bolivia and as far east as the Guyanas. Cannot be identified readily by sight, but it is the only screech-owl throughout most of its range and within its habitat. Song is a purring trill that can easily be mistaken for the purring of a toad or insect. Plumage varies from grayish brown overall to reddish."
0,Foothill Stipplethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Epinecrophylla spodionota,https://ebird.org/species/fooant1,"Small antwren of dense foothill forests. Male is grayish with the black speckled throat that gives this group of antwrens their name. Note also the bold whitish wingbars, and brown flanks, rump, and tail. Females are entirely tan with bold wingbars. Forages in the understory of mature forest, often in mixed-species flocks. Song is a rising-falling series of high pitched notes."
0,Forbes's Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Anumara forbesi,https://ebird.org/species/forbla1,"Medium-sized, slim blackbird with uniform matte black plumage. Note the long straight bill with a straight upper mandible. Has a very small, but disjunct, distribution; occurs at the forest edge near marshes and even in sugarcane plantations.

0,Forbes's Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius forbesi,https://ebird.org/species/forplo1,"Pretty plover that is found in both wet and dry habitats. Note the black cap, gray forehead, white stripe behind the eye, and two black bands across the breast. In flight, shows a small amount of white on the trailing edge of the wings and the corners of the tail. Found in a variety of open habitats, such as short grassland (including recently burned areas), cultivation, and muddy wetland edges. At least partially migratory. The call is a plaintive “treeow” which is sometimes given in a rolling series. Very similar to Three-banded Plover, but separated by the dark gray rather than pale forehead, and by the thicker lower breast band."
0,Forest Bittern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Zonerodius heliosylus,https://ebird.org/species/forbit1,"A large, shy bird of forest streams in the lowlands and foothills. Strong barring apart from white belly. Note the dagger-shaped bill with a broad base, striking yellow eyes and yellow legs. Solitary and feeds on small fish and crustaceans in streams. Flies up and perches in trees when flushed. Similar to the juvenile Rufous Night-Heron but found in more forested environments and has barring rather than streaks and spots. Normally silent."
0,Forest Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo trizonatus,https://ebird.org/species/moubuz3,"A resident, brownish buzzard of forest, forest edge, and adjacent open areas. The breast is heavily blotched with brown, and there is often a paler “U”-shaped patch on the lower breast. It calls a plaintive mewing “keeaaar”. The similar Common Buzzard is variable but it often has a more uniformly brown (less blotchy) chest than Forest Buzzard, it tends to have a rusty (not dark) tail, and it is a migrant that is present within the range of Forest Buzzard (in more open habitats) mostly between September and April."
0,Forest Canary,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra scotops,https://ebird.org/species/forcan1,"A very streaky yellow-green canary with a chunky pale pinkish bill. The male has a blackish face and chin and a yellow eyebrow. The female is grayer on the face. Pairs and small groups frequent forest edges, thickets, gardens, and the edges of cultivation. The jumbled song and call are high-pitched and varied. Similar looking citrils occur farther north in Africa."
0,Forest Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis gaimardii,https://ebird.org/species/forela1,"This nondescript flycatcher is most often detected by its call, a piercing two-parted “pee-sweet!” Visually it’s not overwhelming: yellowish underparts, olive upperparts, pale yellowish wingbars, and a gray head with a vague white eyebrow and black eyeline. Fairly small and similar to other species of elaenia and flycatchers; voice is most useful feature for identification. Usually seen singly in the canopy of lowland forest, often following mixed-species flocks. Widespread from Panama to Brazil."
0,Forest Fody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia omissa,https://ebird.org/species/forfod1,"Sparrow-like weaver in which red-hooded breeding males are distinctive, but females and non-breeding females are drab. Madagascar endemic that is found in and adjacent to rainforest, sometimes in flocks that may include other birds. Calls are high, silvery notes, given in long series as a song. Can be very similar to Red Fody. Breeding male Forest Fody lacks red on the back and belly, though molting male Red Fody can match this pattern. Females and non-breeding males very similar, but Forest Fody is darker and more greenish, with a larger bill. Hybrids are also common and further confuse identification. Unlike Red Fody, found in the rainforest interior."
0,Forest Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Microptilotis montanus,https://ebird.org/species/forhon1,"A rare, medium-sized honeyeater of foothill forest in northern New Guinea. Fairly uniform, brown plumage with a white ear spot and light mottling below. Forages singly for insects and doesn’t really visit flowering trees.

0,Friedmann's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra pulpa,https://ebird.org/species/frilar1,"A small, compact lark with dark brown upperparts that appear scaly in fresh plumage, a streaked crown that can be raised as a crest, an indistinct tawny eyebrow, a striking pale throat, and a pale belly with dark breast streaks. The bill is bicolored: pale below with a dark ridge on the upper mandible. The tail is mostly dark with white outer feathers that are conspicuous in flight. Movements of this very localized lark are poorly known, but small groups are probably partial migrants and nomads in dense grassland with scattered bush; likely often goes undetected when not singing. Best identification feature is the diagnostic song, a single-note strident loud up-and-down “wheeeeoooo” whistle, repeated incessantly every two seconds for minutes at a time."
0,Friendly Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella accentor,https://ebird.org/species/frbwar1,"Though frequently derided for the reputed inaccuracy of its name, this mouse-like bird can prove quite confiding. It is, however, generally quite difficult to see in dense undergrowth; best detected by its song, a series of three piercing whistles, the last of which is long and grating. If seen, note dark brown plumage, speckled gray throat and chest, and long broad tail. Found on only a handful of forested mountaintops in Borneo’s Crocker Range, where it skulks about in tangled mossy areas with extensive fallen debris."
0,Friendly Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura albolimbata,https://ebird.org/species/frifan1,"A fairly small, long-tailed bird of montane forest and edge. Uniform dark, slaty-gray with blackish face and wing. White throat, short brow and mark behind the eye, dotted wing bars and tail tip. Fairly tame as the name suggests.

Fairly long tail and black face with gray bill and blue eye wattle. Male has white belly and collar, black tail, back and wings with a white wing patch. Female has orange chest, throat and collar with rufous tail, back and wings. Limited overlap with the similar Ochre-collared Monarch, but Frilled male has a white rather than orange collar, and the female a rufous rather than brown back. Voice, a series of buzzing notes, sometimes interspersed with a high-pitched “whip”, and an up-and-down whistled song."
0,Fuegian Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago stricklandii,https://ebird.org/species/fuesni1,"Large and heavy-bodied snipe of remote islands around Tierra del Fuego; very rarely seen and poorly known. Favors tussock grass and wetland habitats with grassy cover, where it runs in preference to flying, but can be very confiding. Plumage is similar to the more common and frequently seen South American Snipe, which has “normal” snipe proportions and is not fat-bodied like the Fuegian Snipe. Fuegian is often darker overall than South American Snipe, with dense pale spotting on upperparts and heavier dark barring on a buffy (not white) belly and thicker legs."
0,Fujian Niltava,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Niltava davidi,https://ebird.org/species/fujnil1,"A large flycatcher of tropical and subtropical forests. Male is bright blue above with a black face and orange breast and belly which becomes paler toward the vent. Rufous-bellied Niltava is extremely similar but has a bright patch on the shoulder and brighter orange underparts are uniform in intensity down to the vent. Vivid Niltava can also be similar but has an orange throat and is darker blue above. The mostly brown female is difficult to identify, but it is cooler and grayer overall compared to female Rufous-bellied. Female Fujian has a small bright white collar that is lacking in female Vivid.

Coloration similar to many other nuthatches: gray above and white below, with a thick black line through the eye. Picky in its habitat preferences and as a result generally uncommon or absent through much of its range; requires extensive stands of mature tall pines in foothills and montane regions. Can be quite loud, giving a hoarse chatter reminiscent of a corvid; also gives a clipped fluty whistle."
0,Giant Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Hydrornis caeruleus,https://ebird.org/species/giapit1,"Extremely elusive and rarely-seen ground-dweller; listen instead for its haunting whistle. If seen, overall size and chunkiness alone should be sufficient to distinguish this species from other pittas. Male has bright blue wings and a grayish head with a thin black line curving downwards from behind the eye. Female is browner overall, with a blue rump and warm rufous-brown wings. Rare in lowland and foothill forests, particularly in swampy or riparian areas."

0,Gilded Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Capitonidae,Capito auratus,https://ebird.org/species/gilbar1,"Large, boldly marked barbet of lowland rainforest. Plumage is variable: throat and breast range from yellow to red while the rest of the body is marked yellow and black. Found in a variety of habitats from forest edge to mature rainforest. Its hooting song is far reaching and can be told from other barbets by its pattern: a series of doubled hoots that accelerate."
0,Gilded Flicker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Colaptes chrysoides,https://ebird.org/species/gilfli,"Large woodpecker, very similar to Northern Flicker. Overall pale sandy brown with gray face and brown crown. Spotted below with black oval on chest. Underwing and shafts of flight feathers bright yellow. Males have red mustache stripe; sexes otherwise alike. Combination of face pattern and yellow in wings helps distinguish from both ""Red-shafted"" and ""Yellow-shafted"" Northern Flickers.

Immatures are white or pale tan with light brown markings; also look for the distinctive pink bill with sharply demarcated black tip. Most similar to Iceland Gull but larger, larger-billed, and usually even paler; Iceland typically shows more dark markings on wingtips. Also note shorter wingtips on Glaucous that do not extend far past tip of tail. Breeds in the High Arctic; winters farther south in a variety of habitats, rarely far from a large body of water. Often seen in small numbers mixed with flocks of other large gulls. Hybridizes with Glaucous-winged Gull and Herring Gull in parts of range; hybrids can show any mix of intermediate traits and are sometimes best left unidentified."
0,Glaucous Macaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Anodorhynchus glaucus,https://ebird.org/species/glamac1,"Mysterious and likely extinct, this large and magnificent macaw was only known from now much-reduced open grassy habitats with substantial palm stands. Very similar in appearance to Hyacinth and Indigo Macaws (neither of which overlap in range), but notably more greenish overall, with a grayish head and bare yellow skin around the eyes and at the base of the lower bill. Remoteness of habitat, combined with persistent reports by local communities, suggest that this impressive species may still persist, albeit in extremely low numbers."

0,Glossy Black-Cockatoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Cacatuidae,Calyptorhynchus lathami,https://ebird.org/species/glbcoc1,"Smaller brownish-black cockatoo of eastern Australia. Male fairly plain except for bright red tail panels. Female has blotchy yellow patches on neck and face and orange-red tail panels. Large bill used to feed on Allocasuarina and Casuarina seeds. The species is entirely dependent on these trees, and recently chewed seed-cones are good indicators of their presence. Usually observed in small groups rather than large flocks. Calls include drawn-out notes with a rougher, croakier tone than Red-tailed and Yellow-tailed Black-Cockatoos."
0,Glossy Flowerpiercer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa lafresnayii,https://ebird.org/species/gloflo1,"This glossy-black flowerpiercer has a distinctive silvery patch on the shoulder. Most similar to Black Flowerpiercer, which is smaller and lacks the shoulder patch in most of its range (although in east Andes in Colombia, Black Flowerpiercer has a small gray shoulder patch).

Greenish above, white below, with black throat and golden patch in dark wings. Usually inhabits foothill and upper-elevation forests, but will descend to lower elevations during harsh winters. Loud and vocal: gives chirps, squeaks, trills, and chattering calls."
0,Golden Pheasant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Chrysolophus pictus,https://ebird.org/species/golphe,"Shy and surprisingly difficult to find in mixed and conifer woodland, where it runs quickly from detected disturbance. Red-and-gold male stunning and unmistakable. Female differs from Common Pheasant in strongly barred plumage, dull pinkish (not gray) legs and feet and from Lady Amherst’s Pheasant in lighter barring, more orangeish coloration, and the lack of a bare patch of gray skin behind the eye. Native to China but introduced very locally in Britain and Hawaii; however, captive birds might escape anywhere."
0,Golden Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Tmetothylacus tenellus,https://ebird.org/species/golpip1,"An unusual pipit of dry country. Breeding males are spectacular, with yellow underparts, a black chest band, and yellow wings with black tips. Non-breeding males and females are much duller, though they still have a yellow wash to the underparts and along the edges of the wing and outer tail feathers. Found in dry savanna. Wanders widely, and most likely to be seen after rains. Feeds on the ground, but often perches in bushes. Breeding male recalls a longclaw, but is easily separated by the yellow wing. Females and non-breeding males can be confused with other pipits and longclaws, but are smaller, and can still be distinguished by yellow in the wing and tail. The song consists of scratchy whistles."
0,Golden Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Tachycineta euchrysea,https://ebird.org/species/golswa1,"A graceful aerial feeder often found swooping for insects over pine woodlands or perched in tall snags. The Tree Swallow is rather similar, but has a blue-green rather than golden-green iridescence above. Also, the Tree Swallow has a less deeply forked tail and lacks the white on the side of neck that is present on the Golden Swallow. Vocalizations include a scratchy “chit-it” or “chit,” a sweet inflected “ch-yoy,” and various musical twitters."
0,Golden Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Tangara arthus,https://ebird.org/species/goltan1,"Small tanager found in Andean foothills and subtropical zone from Venezuela to Bolivia. Mostly bright golden-yellow with isolated black ear patch, streaked back, and mostly black wings and tail. Some variation among populations, with northernmost birds showing a chestnut breast band and flanks. Sexes alike; young birds duller yellow.

Dark green back, dark streaks on pale green underparts, pink and purple face, and red crown. Seasonal movements with the flowering of host trees. Most similar to the rare Striated Lorikeet, but Goldie’s Lorikeet is usually found at higher elevation, has dark streaks on a pale background rather than the other way round, the distinctive face color and a yellow band across the wing in flight. Call, a high-pitch, ringing “slik!” or longer, slurred “siikilik!”."
0,Goliath Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus goliath,https://ebird.org/species/golcou1,"An unmistakable massive black cuckoo with creamy-white wing patches that are visible both perched and in flight. Rare pale forms also occur that have pale heads and variable buff areas on their bodies. Juveniles similar to typical dark adults, but show chestnut on the underparts. The species is found in pairs or small groups within dense tangles in the understory of forest and in nearby thick undergrowth. Often detected by call, a series of deep, very low-pitched “boop” notes, descending toward the end. Also gives a very different, harsh, scraping “chow” call in alarm."
0,Goliath Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea goliath,https://ebird.org/species/golher1,"This enormous heron stands 1.5 meters tall and has a robust, dagger-like bill. The immature has rustier upperwings than the adult. Its flight is ponderous and labored. Goliath Heron inhabits large rivers, marshes, estuaries, and mangroves, hunting for large fish and other animals, stabbing them with an open bill. It has a distinct, barking “kowoork” call that can be heard from up to 2 km away. Purple Heron has similar plumage, but Goliath Heron is twice the size, has a much larger bill, and has a rufous (not blackish) top of the head."
0,Gorgeted Puffleg,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Eriocnemis isabellae,https://ebird.org/species/gorpuf1,"Rare and endangered hummingbird found in the Andes of southwestern Colombia. Accessing its tiny known range is difficult, and only a few intrepid and lucky birders have seen one. Male looks quite dark, but has a glittering blue throat bordered on both sides by iridescent green as well as white leg puffs and a blue vent. Female is mostly green with a buffy tinge to the underparts, faint whisker marks, and smaller leg puffs; she is similar to female Glowing Puffleg, but typically has a fainter throat patch and less buff on the neck. Inhabits stunted cloud forest at high elevations."
0,Gorgeted Sunangel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Heliangelus strophianus,https://ebird.org/species/gorsun1,"Unmistakable; glittering pinkish-purple throat is distinctive in good light, but also note the snowy white chest band, which is always obvious. Medium-sized with a rather short, straight bill. Like other sunangels, holds wings out for a few seconds after it lands. Based on plumage, could be confused with Purple-throated Woodstar, but the sunangel is larger with a much different flight style. The only sunangel within limited range on the west slope of Andes; occurs mostly in Ecuador, but barely extends into Colombia. Occurs in a rather narrow elevational band in the upper subtropical zone from around 1,700 to 2,300 m.

Adult has distinctive black and white crescents on the throat, which may be reduced or lacking in young birds. Male has chestnut underparts and white spots on the breast; female has gray underparts. Shy and not often seen, but with luck it may be encountered in small groups that walk on the forest floor. Song is like that of other wood-quails, a long and rollicking series of whistles."
0,Gorgeted Woodstar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Chaetocercus heliodor,https://ebird.org/species/gorwoo2,"Woodstars are tiny hummingbirds that fly like bumblebees. Gorgeted Woodstar is found in the subtropical and temperate zone of the Andes from Venezuela to Ecuador, where it inhabits cloud forest, edges, and second growth. Males are deep emerald-green (more of a bluish tone than other woodstars) with a glittering wine-colored throat and white patches on the sides of the rump. Females are trickier; note the rufous rump and tail with a black band at the base, extremely small size, short tail, and buffy infusion on the throat. On both sexes, bill often appears slightly decurved, more than other woodstars. Sometimes seen singly feeding in the canopy or at lower patches of flowers. Visits feeders."

0,Gosling's Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza goslingi,https://ebird.org/species/gosbun1,"A bunting with cinnamon underparts, black-and-brown mottled upperparts, and a black-and-orange bill. The male’s head is boldly striped black-and-white and the throat is pale gray. The female’s head is less contrasting, with gray and buff stripes, and the throat is streaked blackish-brown. Juvenile is duller than adult. Prefers rocky outcrops, quarries, and gullies in arid and moist savanna and semi-desert, favoring open ground. Often found in pairs. It is often detected by its grating song. The similar Cinnamon-breasted Bunting differs from Gosling’s Bunting by having a black (not gray or blackish-brown streaked) throat and less rusty wings; birds in northern Ethiopia/Eritrea may be part of a hybrid swarm. House Bunting has a streaked (not solid) throat and breast."
0,Gough Island Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Rowettia goughensis,https://ebird.org/species/goifin1,"A large striking finch with a dagger-like bill and different looking sexes. Male is mostly olive with a black throat and yellow eye-ring and moustache; female is brownish and lacks the black throat. Juvenile similar to female but heavily streaked.

0,Gould's Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus stellatus,https://ebird.org/species/goufro1,"Cryptic, seldom-seen nightbird of lowland and foothill forests. Unlike other small frogmouths, sexes are alike. Light morph is bright rufous with scattered white dots on the wings and mottled-white underparts. Dark morph is brown but with the same general patterning. Compare with Sunda Frogmouth: male Sunda is much more heavily marked with white above and has patchier markings on the underparts, while female Sunda has a prominent white band across the chest. Sumatran and Bornean Frogmouths inhabit higher elevations. Song is a loud “weeow-wah.” Calls include “weeow” and a rapid series of “wuk” notes that resembles a thrush’s alarm call."

Two subspecies; breeds off of New South Wales and along the central mountain range of New Caledonia respectively. Migrates east and north across Pacific Ocean after breeding. Distinguished from other gadfly petrels by darker cap, and broader dark band on underwing. Can be seen feeding in association with other seabirds, tuna and dolphins."
0,Gould's Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx stellata,https://ebird.org/species/gousho1,"Bizarrely for the cover-loving shortwings, this species breeds on treeless alpine slopes, where it takes shelter behind boulders instead of leaves. Coloration is unlike that of any other shortwing: bright rusty-orange above with an extremely finely barred throat and round white spots on the flanks. Descends into subalpine forests, where it can often be found in dense vegetation near streams."
0,Gould's Toucanet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Ramphastidae,Selenidera gouldii,https://ebird.org/species/goutou1,"Beautiful small, multicolored toucan.

0,Graceful Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia gracilis,https://ebird.org/species/grapri1,"Tiny, disproportionately long-tailed, active, and vocal. The upperparts are gray-brown with heavy dark streaking, the underparts are pale, and each tail feather shows both pale and dark tips. Generally found in rather moist habitats within arid zones, including field margins, riparian woodland, scrub, gardens, and wetlands; can be quite numerous. Very vocal, especially in spring. The song is a long series of dry chirps with a very slight pause between notes, subtly different from the rattling song of Delicate Prinia. Males often sing from obvious perches. Visually extremely similar to Delicate Prinia, but there is little overlap in range. In any areas of overlap, best separated by song, but Graceful is also slightly shorter- and broader-tailed and grayer."
0,Gran Canaria Blue Chaffinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Fringilla polatzeki,https://ebird.org/species/blucha3,"Endemic to the island of Gran Canaria in the Canary Islands.

Endemic to the island of Grand Comoro. Found at middle and high elevations in humid forest, including thickets, clearings, edges, and tree heath at high elevations. An inconspicuous bird, except by voice, that skulks in thick vegetation. The vocalizations are “chek” and “veet” notes often given in a series. There are no similar warblers on Grand Comoro, so identification is simple."
0,Grand Comoro Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Hypsipetes parvirostris,https://ebird.org/species/combul1,"A medium-sized greenish-gray bird with a black cap and a carrot-colored bill, endemic to the middle and high elevations of the mountains of Grand Comoro. Found in humid forest and in adjacent plantations and secondary areas. Often in small, noisy groups. Very similar in appearance to Madagascar Bulbul, and they overlap at moderate elevations, especially in degraded habitats. Grand Comoro Bulbul is separated by the slightly larger size, the olive tint to the plumage, especially on the back, the yellowish tint to the underparts, and the paler belly and undertail. Its song is an unmusical series of rattling and scraping notes, often given from a high perch, similar to Madagascar Bulbul’s, but slightly lower-pitched and more metallic."
0,Long-billed Rhabdornis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Rhabdornis grandis,https://ebird.org/species/lobrha1,"A medium-sized, long-billed bird of foothill and montane forest in northern Luzon with a white throat and belly, a brown back, rufous wings and tail, a black mask with a thin white eyebrow above, a gray crown, and brown sides broadly streaked white.

Adult male is a deep, almost eye-searing blue with jet-black wings. Females and immatures are brown with white streaks all over the head and underparts and weak white bars on the wings. Long-billed and sharp-winged profile, along with flocking behavior, is more reminiscent of starlings than thrushes."
0,Grant's Bluebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Spermophaga poliogenys,https://ebird.org/species/grablu1,"A large, chunky-headed black-and-red forest waxbill with a blue-and-red bill. Sexes differ: the male has a red forehead extending to the midcrown and eyes that appear to be rimmed by black spectacles, while the female has white spots on the belly and red only on the throat and rump. Juvenile is like the female, but lacks spotting and red on the throat. A scarce and secretive resident in the undergrowth of lowland primary and swamp forest in the Congo Basin up to 1400 meters of elevation. Song is a mournful series of 7–8 descending notes “deeeee-deee-deee-deee-dee-doo-dee-doo.” Male Red-headed Bluebill is very similar to male Grant’s, but red extends onto the nape and eyes appear to have whitish rims; male Black-bellied Seedcracker has a blue-black bill."

Generally pale brownish with complex patterning on upperparts; compare with much plainer House Wren. Variable voice, usually including harsh chips, buzzes, and trills."
0,Grasshopper Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Butastur rufipennis,https://ebird.org/species/grabuz1,"A small, slim, fairly long-tailed buzzard. Gray and brown on the upperparts and rufous on the underparts. The white throat has a black line down the center. In flight, reveals distinctive rufous patches on the tops of the wings, with mostly white underwings. Found in a variety of savanna and grassland habitats. A migratory species that is often found in flocks, especially near fires. Best told from other buzzards by its structure, and in flight by its rufous wing panels. The call is a series of “ki” notes."
0,Grasshopper Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Ammodramus savannarum,https://ebird.org/species/graspa,"Small, short-tailed, flat-headed sparrow found in weedy grasslands. Warm buffy coloration with clean unstreaked breast. Thin white eyering and yellow patch above eye. Back and wings are patterned with gray and rufous. Easy to see when singing atop a shrub, but can be very secretive much of the year. Best detected by its dry, insect like trill preceded by a few introductory notes. Typically not in flocks."
0,Grassland Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Ammodramus humeralis,https://ebird.org/species/graspa1,"Small sparrow with a short tail found in grasslands including agricultural areas with grassy edges. Brownish gray above with heavy dark streaks and brownish wings, and plain gray-buff below. Note the short yellow eyebrow that does not reach beyond the eye. Usually sings a series of soft buzzy whistles from fence posts or shrubs."
0,Grassland Yellow-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sicalis luteola,https://ebird.org/species/gryfin1,"Small yellowish bird, very local in tropical savannas and open grassland with scattered bushes and palmetto shrubs. Usually in groups, sometimes in fairly big flocks. Feeds mainly in grasses, eating seeds, and comes to drink at small pools; often perches on roadside fences. Note the rather stubby gray bill, yellow face and underparts, and streaked back. There are no especially similar species in Mexico and Central America, but several in South America."
0,Grauer's Broadbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Eurylaimidae,Pseudocalyptomena graueri,https://ebird.org/species/grabro1,"A unique dumpy green flycatcher-like broadbill with a buffy crown, a black eye-stripe, and a powder-blue throat and vent. Juvenile duller. A scarce resident found singly and in pairs in the lower canopy and at middle levels of primary Albertine Rift Forest between 1760 and 2500 meters of elevation, preferring the edges of clearings. Highly localized, occurring in two isolated populations in Bwindi (Uganda) and Itombwe/Kahuzi (Democratic Republic of Congo), and inexplicably absent from ideal intervening habitat. May join flocks, but inconspicuous unless calling its soft high-pitched tinny “tsit-tsit,” repeated multiple times, and a rapid “tseet-tsit-tsit-sit-sit-it-it” in flight."
0,Grauer's Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina graueri,https://ebird.org/species/gracus1,"A cuckooshrike with a grayish head, throat, and upperparts and a white lower breast and belly; the male is dark slaty above with a mild sheen, and the female is matte gray with a buff vent. A scarce and extremely localized bird, restricted to the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, found in pairs in the canopy of western Albertine Rift mid-altitude and montane forest between 1150 and 1900 meters of elevation. This very seldom-seen bird’s vocalizations are unknown. Gray Cuckooshrike does not have a white belly and White-breasted Cuckooshrike is larger and paler than Grauer’s."
0,Grauer's Swamp Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus graueri,https://ebird.org/species/grswar1,"Nondescript, long-tailed, long-billed wetland warbler. There is a white eyebrow and dark spotting on the throat and breast. Found very locally in high-elevation marshes of the Albertine Rift. Fairly secretive, but will perch up to sing. The song is a dry trill preceded by a couple of “chyet” notes. Very similar to Little Rush-Warbler, but has a bolder white eyebrow, dark chest spotting, and a very different song. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed warblers."
0,Grauer's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Macrosphenidae,Graueria vittata,https://ebird.org/species/grawar1,"Taxonomically unusual though not very boldly marked warbler. In poor light, or at a distance, looks dingy overall. A good look reveals a brown-olive back, and underparts that are heavily marked with fine barring. Found in thick understory tangles in montane forest of the Albertine Rift. Usually detected by its odd voice: a high, short, rising trill which sounds more like an insect than a bird. Most likely to be confused with Green-backed Camaroptera, but is larger, has a dark rather than red eye, and has fine barring below."
0,Gray Catbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Dumetella carolinensis,https://ebird.org/species/grycat,"Medium-sized songbird, smaller than a robin, with a smooth gray body, black cap, and rusty-red undertail.

Found in shrubby riparian woodland. Usually seen singly."
0,Gray Kingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/grykin,"A relatively pale kingbird, medium-gray above and white below with a darker face mask. Primarily a Caribbean species with limited range in U.S.; found around the edge of dense woodland, especially near the coast. Also seen in more suburban areas. Often perches conspicuously on a snag, treetop, or powerline. Feeds on insects. Listen for its high-pitched twittering calls. Compare with Eastern and Loggerhead Kingbirds; Gray Kingbird has lighter gray upperparts, a thicker bill, and lacks white tail tips."
0,Gray Thrasher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Toxostoma cinereum,https://ebird.org/species/grathr1,"Fairly large and long-tailed songbird found only in Baja California peninsula. Favors deserts with cactus, but also in adjacent scrubby woodland, thickets, and gardens. Feeds mainly on the ground, where runs well. Feeds less often in fruiting trees and bushes. Note the fairly long, slightly arched bill, golden eyes, and boldly spotted breast. Cactus Wren occurs in same areas and looks rather similar but is slightly smaller with white eyebrow, shorter bill, dark eyes, boldly barred tail, and different voice.

0,Gray Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo vicinior,https://ebird.org/species/gryvir,"One of North America's most nondescript birds: pale gray above, lighter whitish below, with a hint of pale spectacles and wingbars. Long-tailed for a vireo, but with a typically thick bill. Occurs on dry rocky slopes with patches of dense brush and trees, especially oaks and junipers. Usually seen singly or in pairs, often detected by voice. Most similar to drab Bell's Vireo but note habitat and size differences. Also compare with Plumbeous Vireo, which is shorter-tailed and more boldly marked."
0,Gray's Grasshopper Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Helopsaltes fasciolatus,https://ebird.org/species/grgwar1,"An odd, thrush-like warbler; extremely shy and seldom seen as it lurks about in dense undergrowth. The largest grasshopper-warbler, with a distinctly robust appearance. Matte brown with pale brow, throat, and belly. Complete lack of streaking distinguishes this species from Middendorff’s and Pallas’s grasshopper-warblers; white throat and pale brow distinguish Gray’s from the much browner Pleske’s Warbler. Slightly warmer-colored Sakhalin Grasshopper-Warbler is extremely similar but has a whiter throat, a thicker brow, and more extensive brown on the underside."
0,Gray's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Ammomanopsis grayi,https://ebird.org/species/gralar2,"A stocky, pale, plain buffy-white lark that frequently matches the color of the stony terrain it lives in. Its dark-tipped pale gray-blue bill and white-fringed dark tail distinguish it. Pairs and flocks of up to 30 are resident and nomadic in barren gravel plains with sparse cover of grass and shrubs. Mostly at night, it sings a soft tinkling “tink tink” with upslurred “swee” whistles interspersed. Gray’s Lark is most similar to Tractrac Chat, but the latter flicks its wings and has a pale rump; Stark’s Lark has a crest and streaked upperparts, and female sparrow-larks have dark belly patches."
0,Grayish Baywing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Agelaioides badius,https://ebird.org/species/bawcow4,"A medium-sized blackbird with a short bill.

Long and heavy bill, gray crown and nape, brown forehead and upperparts, and buffy throat. Underparts and cheeks ochre with strong black barring. Sexes similar. Rare and difficult to see even when singing. Mostly in darker understory in very wet cloud forest rich in palms, on the floor or at mid-levels. Song is a long, trilled “Br’ur’ur’ur’ur’ur’ur’…” ending abruptly, very similar to Undulated Antpitta but more uniform in pitch and pace. Also very similar in plumage to Undulated Antpitta, which has a smaller bill and body size, as well a blackish moustache and less contrast between forehead and crown than Great. Endemic to Venezuela with three isolated populations."
0,Great Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Taraba major,https://ebird.org/species/greant1,"Strikingly patterned but very skulking bird of forest borders, thickets, and tangles in humid tropical lowlands; uncommon. Heard much more often than seen; typically sings from dense vine tangles. Song suggests some trogons, but ends with a quiet snarl audible at close range. Male is black above; female is rusty above. Both have clean white underparts, bright red eyes, stout hooked bills, and crests that can be raised or lowered."
0,Great Argus,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Argusianus argus,https://ebird.org/species/grearg1,"The great tail- and wing-fanning courtship display of the male Great Argus is among the most remarkable on Earth. At rest, the long feathers and tail feathers give the blue-headed male an excessively lengthy, freight-train-like appearance. Female more warmly colored than male but lacks long plumes and has paler blue head. Inhabits lowland to foothill forests with a relatively thin understory and mature trees, from which the male’s lovelorn-sounding courtship call “kow-WOW” resonates loudly, even as it remains frustratingly hidden."
0,Great Auk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Pinguinus impennis,https://ebird.org/species/greauk,"Extinct, last reported in 1844."
0,Great Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Megalaimidae,Psilopogon virens,https://ebird.org/species/grebar1,"This largest of the barbets is colorful, but often appears all-dark from a distance. No other barbet in its range combines the features of a massive pale bill, black head, and dark olive back. Sluggish and shy; tends to stick to dense forest canopy, where it is difficult to see. Its loud hooting song (typically a series of two repetitive notes) is often the only indication of this species’s presence. Also gives a harsh, screaming “karrrrr” that has a gull-like quality."
0,Great Black Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteogallus urubitinga,https://ebird.org/species/grbhaw1,"Uncommon in forest, marshes, and mangroves, where usually greatly outnumbered by similar Common Black Hawk. Slightly larger and lankier than Common Black Hawk, with longer legs and tail, and adults of the two species have very different calls in flight. Adult Great Black has 2 white tail bands (1 on Common) and less extensive yellow in face. Immature looks whiter-headed than Common (no big black moustaches), and its longer tail has narrower and more numerous pale bars. Usually warier than Common, which can be quite unconcerned by people."
0,Great Blue Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea herodias,https://ebird.org/species/grbher3,"Huge gray heron, no other similar species in range. Note large yellow-orange bill, short black plumes on head, and black and chestnut pattern on shoulder. Immatures are more brownish than adults, and have a dark crown.

0,Great Bowerbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Chlamydera nuchalis,https://ebird.org/species/grebow1,"Large and noisy bowerbird. Bright pink crest can be raised and lowered. Primarily gray brown with white scalloping on the back. Females are smaller and may lack the pink crest. Males create a very large bower out of twigs and grasses; it is then decorated with small objects, which are often red, green, or white. Found in northern Australia, usually in dry woodlands."
0,Great Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Otis tarda,https://ebird.org/species/grebus1,"Huge, unmistakable, regal bird of treeless open plains and natural steppes, occupying some low-intensity agricultural areas. Walks in a stately manner, but may run rather than fly if disturbed. Flight is heavy and gooselike. Highly gregarious, especially in winter. Males are much larger than the females and the sexes do not mix much outside of the breeding season. Spectacular ""foaming bath"" display at leks (display sites) as males bristle their body and wing feathers forward, turning them white, while burying their head in the plumage."
0,Great Cormorant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax carbo,https://ebird.org/species/grecor,"Large cormorant found nearly worldwide.

Vocalizations are loud and variable; one common variation is a “SQUEE’ch’ch’ch-cheet-cheet” with both nasal and chattering notes. With a poor view can be surprisingly similar to Black-billed Thrush, but that species lacks wingbars and has a longer bill."
0,Great Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata minor,https://ebird.org/species/grefri,"A large black seabird that holds its wings in a distinctive crook. The long, forked tail may appear pointed when folded. Males are all black with a red throat pouch. Females have a white breast. Immatures have a white head and breast. All-dark plumage of male and lack of a pale “armpit” in female and immature separate this species from Lesser and Christmas Island Frigatebirds. Separation from Magnificent Frigatebird can be difficult; note pale wing panel in males and indistinct pale throat in females (Magnificent females have a clean all-dark head). Nests in trees and bushes on tropical islands. Often seen flying along the shoreline, sometimes very high, and sometimes inland. Chases other seabirds to steal their prey."

0,Great Iora,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Aegithinidae,Aegithina lafresnayei,https://ebird.org/species/greior1,"A yellowish canopy-dweller with a long, powerful-looking bill. Male is dark above and yellow below, while female is ironically distinctive in her lack of distinctive characteristics; she is plain gray-green above and yellow below. Both sexes can be separated from other ioras by the proportionally larger bill, greater size, and lack of wingbars. Inhabits primary and late secondary broadleaf forests, as well as forest edge, in lowland and foothill regions. Song is a rapid-fire series of high-pitched “chew” notes. Like other ioras, frequently joins mixed-species flocks."
0,Great Jacamar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Galbulidae,Jacamerops aureus,https://ebird.org/species/grejac2,"The largest jacamar is glistening emerald-green above and orange below with a thick black bill. Sexes generally similar; males have entirely green throat and inconspicuous white collar, females have orange throat. Size and bill shape could recall a motmot more than a jacamar, but no motmot combines green head and orange belly. Singles or pairs are typically uncommon to rare in lowland forests, up to around 600 m. They typically perch in the middle to upper levels, and can be quite vocal. Listen for the long descending whistle with a noticeable break in pitch near the beginning, as well as various strange noises that sound like a very angry cat."

0,Great Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus arundinaceus,https://ebird.org/species/grrwar1,"A hulking warbler that resembles Eurasian Reed-Warbler in coloration but far larger with a proportionately more massive head, heavy bill with a dark tip, and a broad, pale eyebrow. Breeds in reed beds, crashing through the reeds in short flights and bending stems when perched. Song short but very loud and memorable with repeated phrases of ""karra-karra-karra gurk gurk gurk chirrr-chirrr karra karra."" Call a high-pitched “krrrrr."""
0,Great Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus rubicilla,https://ebird.org/species/greros1,"As the name suggests, a large rosefinch. Male is bright pink with a dark face and frosty specks on the underparts. Female is streaky brown all over. Very similar to Streaked Rosefinch; look out for unstreaked upperparts in the male and softer, larger white spots on the underparts. Prefers more sparsely vegetated areas at higher elevations than Streaked Rosefinch, favoring alpine and subalpine scree slopes, boulder fields, and other open and barren environments; descends into similar habitat in the winter.

0,Great Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Ardenna gravis,https://ebird.org/species/greshe,"Large shearwater with a crisp dark cap. Long, narrow wings are held quite straight when flying; wingbeats are stiff. Also look for messy brown patch on belly and dark markings on underwings. Notably larger and proportionally longer-winged than Manx Shearwater, and wingbeats are not as snappy. Also compare with Cory's Shearwater, but note all-black bill, dark cap, and slightly quicker wingbeats and straighter wings on Great Shearwater. Primarily an Atlantic species, breeding mainly on remote Tristan Island group in the Southern Hemisphere. Spends the nonbreeding season (May to November) in cool water in the North Atlantic, where it can gather in large flocks, often mixed with other shearwater species. Occasionally seen from land, but prefers to stay offshore."
0,Great Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Heinrichia calligyna,https://ebird.org/species/gresho1,"A shy, long-legged terrestrial flycatcher-like bird restricted to the mountains of Sulawesi. Male is largely dark blue with a blacker face. Female shows a diagnostic white smudge between the eye and bill, but forms differ in underparts coloration: in southeast females show a rufous throat and breast, central females have rufous limited to the throat, and northern ones have a rusty throat and breast. Juveniles are brownish-blue with pale throat streaking. Inhabits montane forest understory, on or close to the ground, often near rocky streamsides. Song is a lazy, thrush-like, melancholy warble comprising several quavering notes."
0,Great Skua,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius skua,https://ebird.org/species/gresku1,"Breeds locally on moorland of northern islands and coasts, where aggressive near nests.

Dark brown overall with big white flashes in outer half of wings; adult has variable pale mottling on upperparts."
0,Great Slaty Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Mulleripicus pulverulentus,https://ebird.org/species/grswoo1,"Gangly and prehistoric-looking, this is the largest woodpecker in the world. Gray all over, with a pink blush on the cheeks and a pale orange bare patch on the throat. Thin neck and long body give it an over-stretched, even starved, appearance. Swoops through the forest in small family flocks, giving loud rolling whinnying calls and hammering powerfully on trees. Confined to pristine forests with an abundance of tall trees."
0,Great Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago media,https://ebird.org/species/gresni1,"Slightly bigger and stockier than Common Snipe, with a long and thick bill, heavily barred belly and contrasting upperwing pattern with dark underwings. Flushes at close range; escape flight is usually slow and short. Typically quiet and silent. Breeds in remote wet meadows or in mountain bogs where males lek (display together). Usually found at marshes on migration; autumn migrants make a direct nonstop flight to tropical African wintering grounds."
0,Great Rufous Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer motitensis,https://ebird.org/species/grrspa1,"A large, chunky sparrow with a bright rufous rump and different-looking males and females. The male has a grayish crown with a rufous crescent around the ears and a white patch between the top of the eye and the base of the bill. The female has a paler washed-out head. Pairs and small groups are loyal to arid thorn scrub, avoiding human-altered habitats. The smaller House Sparrow is most easily told from the Great Rufous Sparrow by having a gray (not rufous) rump."
0,Great Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Synallaxis hypochondriaca,https://ebird.org/species/grespi2,"Handsome spinetail with a highly restricted range, known only from arid Andean valleys southeast of the city of Cajamarca in northern Peru.

0,Great Spotted Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx haastii,https://ebird.org/species/grskiw1,"Large, light grayish brown kiwi with white horizontal banding or mottling along the length of the body. Restricted to the native forests, scrubland, and upland tussock grasslands of the northwestern South Island of New Zealand. More often heard than seen, including loud sniffling as it forages at night for invertebrates. Male produces a series of burry, rising high-pitched whistles. Female has a lower ascending burry whistle. Pairs often duet. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Great Spotted Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos major,https://ebird.org/species/grswoo,"Most common pied woodpecker in most of Eurasia.

0,Greater Antillean Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia fallax,https://ebird.org/species/graela1,"A small inconspicuous flycatcher of montane wooded habitats. This species’ bold wingbars readily distinguish it from the similarly sized Jamaican and Hispaniolan Pewees as well as Jamaican Elaenia. Its full song is a descending whistled “Cheeeu” followed by a quick “wibit-wibit.” Call notes include a descending whistled “Tseeee-oo” or a quick “wibit” as in song, though sometimes given in rapid succession."
0,Greater Antillean Grackle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Quiscalus niger,https://ebird.org/species/gragra1,"A gregarious, noisy inhabitant of many habitats, except dense woodlands; often near human habitation. Adults are clothed in glossy black, have a white eye, very long keel-shaped tail; youngsters are dull brownish in plumage, darker eyed and have a shorter tail. Only the Smooth-billed Ani is similar in color, size, and proportions, but its beak is much heftier than that of the Greater Antillean Grackle. Cuban Blackbird shares color and size, but has a shorter tail without a keel, and a dark eye. Vocalizations are varied but most have a “squeaking rusty hinge” quality; also gives a harsh “chack.”"
0,Greater Adjutant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Leptoptilos dubius,https://ebird.org/species/greadj1,"Immense and imposing undertaker of a stork with a bare head and neck, pale eyes, and dark gray wings.

Separated from the group of “small-billed” flamebacks by a much larger bill, a mottled black-and-white nape instead of a black nape, and a divided black horizontal stripe below the cheek. Separated from the similarly large-billed White-naped Woodpecker by a red rump, the lack of a clean white nape, and a preference for wetter habitat. Greater Flameback is a loose participant in mixed-species foraging flocks, often detected by its loud, high-pitched trill similar to that of Common Flameback."
0,Greater Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicopterus roseus,https://ebird.org/species/grefla3,"Distributed from Africa and southern Europe through West Asia to South Asia.

0,Greater Flowerpiercer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Diglossa major,https://ebird.org/species/greflo1,"Small, dark gray bird of highland forest. Gray plumage is set off by chestnut undertail coverts and black mask and chin, which contrast with the pale silvery bill. Distinctive bill shape can be difficult to discern at a distance. Found only at high elevations (above 1000 m) in the tepui highlands, where it is a locally fairly common resident of humid forest and scrub. In taller forest, it is generally in the canopy but may occasionally descend into the understory. Often observed at fruiting and flowering trees and shrubs, where it plucks fruit and pierces into the bases of flowers to drink nectar. Also follows mixed-species flocks. Unusual song is a mix of high peeping and harsh grating notes; the peeping notes are also given as a contact call. Considerably larger than other flowerpiercers, and unlikely to be mistaken for other species in its limited range."
0,Greater Green Leafbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chloropseidae,Chloropsis sonnerati,https://ebird.org/species/grglea1,"Vivid green bird of lowland evergreen forest canopy where it joins mixed flocks. Male has a black mask and throat. The black throat also has a dark blue center, though this can be difficult to see in poor lighting. Female is clean-faced save for a pale yellow throat and a trace of a blue moustache. Generally smaller than the Lesser Green Leafbird, but the two can be maddeningly difficult to tell apart. On the male Greater Green Leafbirds, look for a more extensive black mask and no traces of yellow on the forehead, while on the female, look for a yellow (not green) throat."
0,Greater Ground-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Amalocichla sclateriana,https://ebird.org/species/grgrob1,"A medium-sized, pittalike bird of sub-alpine forest floor.

In Borneo, overlaps with Hose’s and Whitehead’s Broadbills, both of which tend to be found at higher elevations. In Green Broadbill, note the lack of black on females in any plumage, the clear bars on the wings instead of spots, and the overall larger size. Gives soft, bouncy hooting notes, often in series."
0,Green Catbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Ailuroedus crassirostris,https://ebird.org/species/grecat1,"Chunky rainforest bird with emerald green upperparts, dark eye, and green-olive underparts with pale streaking. Inhabits the east coast of Australia from southeastern Queensland to the south coast of New South Wales, thus does not overlap with Spotted Catbird. Forages mostly in middle and upper story of the rainforest. Compare female and juvenile Satin Bowerbird (with blue eye, darker bill). Call a very loud yowl, which sounds just like a cat."
0,Green Cochoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Cochoa viridis,https://ebird.org/species/grecoc1,"A gorgeously colored but highly elusive and uncommon bird found in extensive hill forests, particularly in areas with well-shaded ravines, gullies, and streams. Slow-moving and restricted to the canopy, where it blends in with the foliage. If seen, the green body is most obvious, followed by the black and silvery-blue bands on the wing. A better look would reveal a sky-blue head with a thin black eye-stripe and a pale blue tail. Listen for its song, a high, thin, even-sounding whistle, often given repeatedly but difficult to pin down."
0,Green Crombec,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Macrosphenidae,Sylvietta virens,https://ebird.org/species/grecro1,"A small, virtually tailless olive-green bird. Note the slightly darker cap and the pale eyebrow. There is geographical variation in the color of the underparts, which vary from brown-and-gray to buff-and-yellow. Found at middle levels and in the understory of rainforest, secondary growth, and scrub, often in pairs or small groups. Very similar to Lemon-bellied Crombec, but slightly larger, longer-billed, and even the subspecies that shows yellow on the belly is duller yellow below than Lemon-bellied. An inconspicuous bird that is most often detected by its song, a quick musical warble in a descending pattern."
0,Green Figbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Sphecotheres viridis,https://ebird.org/species/grnfig1,"Male figbird is a distinctive oriole with a moss-green body and a black head with bright red facial skin. Female is brown, with a heavily streaked lighter underside and dull blue-gray or pinkish facial skin. Juvenile resembles a less boldly marked female. Gregarious; typically found in pairs or small groups within forest, edge, woodland, and mangroves in the lowlands. Occurs in a restricted range in the eastern Lesser Sundas, where it is the only figbird. Song comprises imitations, chattering, and twittering. Also gives harsh “wit,” “burr,” and trill notes: “klerr-wit-wit-wit-wit.”"
0,Green Hermit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Phaethornis guy,https://ebird.org/species/greher1,"Large hummingbird with long white-tipped central tail feathers. Male is entirely blue-green; female has gray belly, green back, and obvious stripes on face. Bill extremely long and decurved. Found in forest, but also visits feeders at forest edge.

0,Green Iora,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Aegithinidae,Aegithina viridissima,https://ebird.org/species/greior2,"A medium-sized canopy-dweller of lowland and foothill forests, often seen with mixed flocks. Male is dark olive-green with boldly black-and-white-striped wings; female is paler, with an olive back and a less contrasting wing pattern. Look for bright yellow “goggles” around dark eyes in both sexes; Common Iora lacks these goggles and has pale eyes, but these can be hard to discern. Song is high, simple, and repetitive: “wit-dee, wit-dee, wit-dee” or “chew-a-wee-chew, chew-a-wee.” Calls vary, but the most common ones are downslurred and rather nasal-sounding."
0,Green Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Cyanocorax yncas,https://ebird.org/species/grnjay,"Stunning and unmistakable: green and yellow plumage with bold black-and-blue head pattern. Birds from Texas to Honduras have a blue crown, dark eye, and relatively uniform lime-green body, and occur in small flocks in woodland with brushy understory. Birds in South America, sometimes called Inca Jays, occur in Andean cloud forest from Venezuela to Bolivia. They show a white crown, pale eye, blue forehead tuft, and rich sulphur-yellow belly contrasting with darker green upperparts. Both populations give a variety of strange mechanical calls."

The most distinctive markings are two yellow wingbars and a yellow rump. Also note the mostly dark bill with a pink base. Found in forest and lush woodland. Usually detected by voice: accelerating trilled phrases that are repeated, sometimes for a long time. Also gives a slower series of several tooting notes. Very similar to Moustached Tinkerbird, but only overlaps slightly in range, and separated by the plain face."
0,Green Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus nitidus,https://ebird.org/species/grnwar1,"Nondescript leaf warbler with two whitish wing bars (often only one visible), dull to bright greenish upperparts, a yellow wash usually restricted to the face, and a pale orange lower bill. Breeds in forest in the Caucasus mountains. Winters primarily in southern India, where it largely overlaps with the similar-looking Greenish Warbler. Although separable from Greenish Warbler by its greener upperparts, yellow on face, and the second wingbar (when present), Green is best identified by its loud, fast, trisyllabic “chi-su-wi” call."
0,Greenish Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis viridicata,https://ebird.org/species/greela,"Unobtrusive and inconspicuous small flycatcher of tropical and subtropical forest; also ranges up into the highlands of West Mexico. Usually found singly, perched quietly (unless singing at dawn) and rather upright at mid-upper levels in trees; does not flick its wings and tail, unlike many small flycatchers. Can be identified by a combination of the lack of pale wingbars, a narrow whitish eyebrow, and the small, overall dark bill."
0,Greenish Puffleg,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Haplophaedia aureliae,https://ebird.org/species/grepuf1,"A fairly dull green hummingbird with small white puffs at the base of each leg.

Male is well-named—drab greenish yellow overall. Female is notably drab and nondescript. In all plumages note lack of any streaking or contrastingly bright yellow areas. Compare with longer-winged Greater Yellow-Finch (some overlap of range in winter)."
0,Grenada Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Leptotila wellsi,https://ebird.org/species/gredov1,"A somewhat large, chunky dove of dry scrub woodlands where it is typically found foraging on ground. Its plain plumage, the lack of white on the wings, and the very limited white on its tail, distinguish it from other doves on Grenada. Its song is a drawn out low, plaintive “Hooooooo,” loudest near start. Critically endangered."
0,Grenada Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiarchus nugator,https://ebird.org/species/grefly1,"A medium-sized “fly-catching” species of open woodlands and scrub including towns, preferring areas near palms; often sits still on perch for long periods of time before leaping forth in pursuit of insects. Grenada Flycatcher has a dull brown back and a yellow belly that contrasts with its gray chest and throat. The Caribbean Elaenia is passingly similar but is smaller with a proportionately small bill, and it has bold wingbars and dull, low-contrast underparts. Vocalizations include an emphatic low “whip” given in a slow series and sometimes followed by a rolling “pit-it-oooo.” Also, this species gives a shrill “whee,” singly or in series."
0,Grimwood's Longclaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Macronyx grimwoodi,https://ebird.org/species/grilon1,"A large pipit-like bird that is much less colorful than other longclaws, with a dull pinkish-buff throat, cinnamon-tawny underparts and extensive dense dark streaking elsewhere. During the breeding season the throat and belly may flush brighter pink, and a small white shoulder patch may be visible. Pairs are localized residents, preferring short grass on floodplains and dambos (seasonally flooded wetlands); retreating to wettest habitats where other longclaws co-occur. Calls an extended series of high-pitched trilling or buzzing notes that sound insect-like, different from other longclaws. Similar but smaller Rosy-throated Longclaw differs from Grimwood’s by having a bold black gorget and brighter pink throat and underparts."

In flight it shows distinctive large buff patches in the broad wings. The isolated simiensis race in the highlands of the Horn of Africa is warmer above and below and may be split as a separate species. Pairs and small groups occupy moorland, grassland, and open woodland, favoring heavily grazed and burned areas. It runs long distances on the ground hunting invertebrates, stopping bolt upright and flicking its wings. The song is a grating, unmelodic “lit-sit-siru-pa.”"
0,Growling Riflebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Ptiloris intercedens,https://ebird.org/species/magrif2,"A large bird of lowland and foothill forest in eastern New Guinea. The bill is fairly long, slightly curved and more feathered in the base than its sister species. Male is mainly black with a blue breast shield, bordered with a pale line below.

0,Guadalupe Murrelet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Synthliboramphus hypoleucus,https://ebird.org/species/xanmur1,"Small black-and-white diving seabird, unlikely to be seen from land. Usually found as singles or pairs, well offshore, and not usually associating with other seabirds. Like most small alcids, dives when alarmed or takes off and flies straight away from the boat. Very similar to Scripps’s Murrelet (the two were once lumped as Xantus’s Murrelet), but white in face more extensive, such that eye stands out in a white area rather than merging into the black cap. Underwings bright white overall, like Scripps’s but unlike dusky underwings of Craveri’s Murrelet."

The species name is linked to the famous guano islands of Peru. Can be seen as singles, but usually seen in flocks, sometimes many thousands feeding, nesting, and roosting in dense masses or commuting in endless streams. Associates readily with pelicans, boobies, other cormorants, and Inca Terns. Adult is handsome with a distinctive “dinner dress” pattern of white extending up into neck and a red patch around the eye. Immature has similar pattern, but is brownish above and the plumage is duller overall."
0,Guatemalan Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Zimmerius vilissimus,https://ebird.org/species/paltyr2,"Small, drab tyrannulet found in the highlands of southern Mexico, Guatemala, and western El Salvador. Fairly inconspicuous; usually found as singles or pairs in middle to upper levels of forests, plantations, and second-growth. Typically perches fairly horizontally with the tail held slightly cocked. Feeds mainly on berries. Note the whitish eyebrow, small bill, and plain-looking wings with very thin yellowish feather edges."
0,Guayaquil Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campephilus gayaquilensis,https://ebird.org/species/guawoo2,"Large woodpecker found in both dry and humid forest in western Ecuador, northwestern Peru, and far southwestern Colombia. Note red head, white “V” on black back, white neck stripes, and barred lower underparts. On female, white neck stripe extends to beak. Similar to Lineated Woodpecker, but Guyaquil Woodpecker’s back stripes converge in a “V”, and it lacks a dark mask around the eye. Often perches on dead trees, and periodically pounds out a loud, powerful burst of knocks."
0,Guianan Gnatcatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Polioptila guianensis,https://ebird.org/species/guigna3,"Inconspicuous and rarely seen bird of rainforest canopy. Small and slender with a long tail; mostly dark gray with a broken white eyering, white belly, and white outer tail feathers. Inhabits canopy of tall forest, especially in regions with sandy soils, and also occurs in shorter-stature forests on white sand. Usually seen with mixed-species flocks as it forages actively in outer foliage, sallying for insects and gleaning from leaves, moving long tail from side to side, like other gnatcatchers. Thin and indistinct call notes are easily overlooked among calls of other species in flocks, but distinctive shape, active behavior, and long tail with much white should clinch identification. Distinguished from Tropical Gnatcatcher by uniform gray body plumage and lack of a black cap."
0,Guianan Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Notharchus macrorhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/guipuf1,"Chunky, large-billed bird of rainforest canopy; easily identified by black-and-white plumage, relatively large size, and staid demeanor. Most often seen perched high in bare branches, sometimes near arboreal termite nests, in which it digs its own nest cavities. May also forage at lower levels. Sits motionless for long periods, sallying to vegetation for large insects. Superficially resembles Pied Puffbird but is much larger with a solid black crown and more white on the forehead."
0,Guianan Red-Cotinga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Phoenicircus carnifex,https://ebird.org/species/gurcot1,"Handsome but seldom-seen cotinga of lowland rainforest. Males are brilliant red and dark rich brown; females are duller but identifiable by red and brown plumage and manakin-like shape. Occurs in mid-story and canopy, where they are usually seen alone. Feeds on fruit which it takes in short sallies from a nearby perch. In limited area of overlap with Black-necked Red-Cotinga, note Guianan’s browner plumage and less clean-cut appearance. Generally quiet; male display sounds include a high-pitched wing whirring and short, explosive calls, both of which may be heard away from display sites."
0,Guianan Streaked-Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula surinamensis,https://ebird.org/species/guista1,"Tiny bird of riverside vine tangles and seasonally flooded forest. Distinctive male is black-and-white while female has burnt orange head and breast; both easily recognized in riverside habitat. Usually found in pairs away from mixed-species flocks. Forages actively, climbing through vines and gleaning insects from leaves. Frequently detected by contact call: a nasal doubled note. The more complex song is heard less often."
0,Guianan Toucanet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Ramphastidae,Selenidera piperivora,https://ebird.org/species/guitou1,"Small toucan of rainforest canopy that is most often seen at fruiting trees at forest edge.

0,Gundlach's Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter gundlachi,https://ebird.org/species/gunhaw1,"A secretive raptor of wooded habitats including mangrove swamps. Though this species sometime soars, its flight is usually powered by several rapid flaps followed by a brief glide. In flight, note the long rounded tail, short rounded wings, and a large head that protrudes well in front of the wings. Adults are barred orange below while immatures are streaked brown. The similar Sharp-shinned Hawk is somewhat smaller in body and head and has a shorter, squared-off tail. Migrant Sharp-Shinned Hawks from North America are scarce within this species’ range, and are best told by structure and size. Resident Sharp-shinned Hawks, which share this species’ range are conveniently barred gray below. Immature Sharp-shinned Hawks can also be distinguished from Gundlach’s by their narrow, but distinct white eyebrow. The Broad-winged Hawk is somewhat similar, but it is much shorter tailed and somewhat longer winged. The common call is an emphatic “eh-eh-eh-eh-eh…,” with the first couple notes quieter than rest."
0,Gunnison Sage-Grouse,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Centrocercus minimus,https://ebird.org/species/gusgro,"Large turkeylike bird found in extensive areas of sagebrush. Both sexes gray overall with very fine patterning, black belly, and long pointed tail. Males have a white breast and a black throat. Spectacular male display involves fanning tail, inflating yellow air sacs on chest, and thrusting them forward to produce liquidy popping noises.

0,Hainan Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis hainanus,https://ebird.org/species/habfly1,"A small flycatcher found in the midstory of both wooded and bamboo forests in lowland and hill regions. Male is dazzling sapphire-blue with a dirty-white belly; lack of other markings or warm coloration distinguishes it from other flycatchers. Female is brown with a pale orange throat and chest. Often joins mixed flocks. Song is a short but pleasant series of throatily warbled whistles, typically a burst of ascending notes, followed by one or two falling notes, then a final rising whistle. Call is sharp “tsik-tsik-tsik”, akin to scissors snipping."
0,Hainan Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus hainanus,https://ebird.org/species/halwar1,"Beautifully luminous small leaf warbler restricted to the forests of China’s Hainan Island. Bright yellow all over, though darker wings and crown make paler wingbars and eyebrow visible nonetheless. Fairly distinctive in its limited range; Hartert’s Leaf Warbler also has a yellow cast but is duller overall and much larger, with a much more elongated appearance. Song is a short jumble of squeaky high-pitched notes akin to a machine that needs oiling."
0,Hainan Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila ardens,https://ebird.org/species/haipar1,"Small game bird restricted to the tropical rainforests of southern Hainan Island, where it is the only forest-dwelling partridge.

Forages mostly on the ground in chattering flocks, in western Queensland."
0,Halmahera Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox hypogramma,https://ebird.org/species/molhao3,"A brown owl with a rounded head, yellow eyes, and rufescent barred underparts. Inhabits forest in the lowlands and lower foothills, where it usually occurs in territorial pairs. Confined to the North Moluccas, where it overlaps with migrant Northern Boobook and Barking Owl, but can be separated from those species by its barred underparts and very different voice. Song is a gruff, abrupt, two-note frog-like “woo-wooo” with a slightly longer second note."
0,Halmahera Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Celebesia parvula,https://ebird.org/species/halcus1,"A medium-sized cuckooshrike from Halmahera with an entirely dark slate-gray body and a black face and throat. Singles and pairs occur within forest, principally in the foothills, but also in the lowlands. The species lacks the pale fringing on the wing feathers and pale spots on the undertail of Common Cicadabird, and further differs in its black throat. Much smaller, smaller-billed, and darker than Stout-billed Cuckooshrike. Gives a harsh, chattering “chit-it-it-it-it” song, characteristic of many cuckooshrikes."
0,Halmahera Flowerpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum schistaceiceps,https://ebird.org/species/flbflo3,"A tiny, dumpy, very short-tailed gray songbird. Paler underparts are divided by a whiter central strip. Males display a diagnostic red patch on the breast that is absent in females. Juveniles resemble female, but are duller, with a pale-based bill. Confined to the north Moluccas. Singles or pairs can be found in canopy of forest and forest edge in the lowlands and foothills. Tiny size and stunted shape aid identification in both sexes, as no other flowerpeckers occur in its range. Gives very high-pitched “tzeee” notes from the canopy, and a wetter “pip” call too."
0,Halmahera Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus infuscatus,https://ebird.org/species/molswi3,"A small dark brown swift with an indistinctly paler gray rump. Underparts are lighter brown than upperparts. A gregarious aerial species, found in flocks, often with other swiftlet species, over a wide variety of open and forested habitats at varied elevations. Limited to the north Moluccas. Marginally smaller than Uniform Swiftlet, and shows a neatly defined, subtly paler rump.

0,Hamerkop,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Scopidae,Scopus umbretta,https://ebird.org/species/hamerk1,"A squat, brown, ibis-like bird with a bushy-crested “hammer-head”; often found near wetlands or rivers. In flight, it has distinctively deep wingbeats and may occasionally soar very high, when the long neck separates it from raptors. It struts about in wetlands foraging for frogs, fish, and insects. It needs nearby large trees for building its giant (1.5-m-across) stick nest. Calls include a high-pitched “nyip” in flight and a distinctive, rollicking call ending in a purring rattle “kyik-kyik-kyik-kyik-kyik kyik-keeek-kreeeeek”."
0,Hammond's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax hammondii,https://ebird.org/species/hamfly,"Small grayish flycatcher, very similar to other flycatchers, especially Dusky and Gray. Subtle differences include smaller bill with limited pale base, slightly more peaked crown, and longer wingtips. Also note habitat during breeding season: Hammond's prefers mature conifers, often seen higher up in trees than Dusky. Habitat overlaps more with other flycatchers during migration and winter; found in a variety of brushy wooded habitats. Back is greenish with a yellow wash to belly; fall birds in fresh plumage are brighter than spring and summer birds. Voice is key to identification, especially call notes: high-pitched ""peek"" and whistled ""peer."" Without an excellent view, silent birds often best left unidentified."

In flight, distinctive bright blue upperwings stand out even along shaded creeks and streams. Widespread in the Afrotropical lowlands, but easy to overlook given its habits and habitat. Primary calls consist of hollow “ko-ko-ko” quacking and occasional wheezy whistles."
0,Hartlaub's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Chroicocephalus hartlaubii,https://ebird.org/species/hargul1,"A medium-sized, pale-gray-backed gull of coastal waters and human settlements. Breeding birds have dark eyes and a very faint chalky-gray hood, which non-breeding birds lack. This adaptable omnivore is the commonest gull of the Benguela Current, but its penchant for eating offal means it is expanding its range eastwards. The similar Gray-hooded Gull differs from Hartlaub’s Gull by being larger, having a yellowish-white eye, a longer redder bill, and a discrete grayish hood in breeding plumage. Immature Gray-hooded Gulls have a black terminal tail band which juvenile Hartlaub’s Gulls lack."
0,Hartlaub's Turaco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Musophagiformes,Musophagidae,Tauraco hartlaubi,https://ebird.org/species/hartur1,"A beautiful green turaco with dark blue wings, tail, and crown. Note the white markings on the head: a white spot in front of the eye and a white line below the eye. Like all turacos, shows large crimson wing patches in flight. Found in montane forests, lush woodlands, and gardens. Acts like a typical turaco, bouncing through the trees and flying occasionally with short bursts of wingbeats and long glides. Similar overall to other turacos, but separated from most by the dark blue crown, and from Purple-crested Turaco by the white facial markings. Call is a gruff, accelerating series of “kow” notes."
0,Hauxwell's Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus hauxwelli,https://ebird.org/species/hauthr1,"Brown thrush of lowland rainforest. Reddish brown overall with a dark bill and no noticeable eye ring. Found in low levels of a variety of forested habitats, especially mature rainforest.

0,Hawaiian Coot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Fulica alai,https://ebird.org/species/hawcoo,"The only coot in the Hawaiian Islands. Similar in appearance to American Coot, but the frontal shield above the bill is larger and more bulbous. Shield may be white or dark reddish-brown. Distinguished from Common Gallinule by white frontal shield, gray feet and legs, and lobed toes. Occurs in wetlands, lakes, ponds, marshes, canals, and golf courses. Often grazes in grassy areas adjacent to wetlands."
0,Hawaiian Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus hawaiiensis,https://ebird.org/species/hawcro,"This large, black, and extraordinarily loud bird vanished from Hawaiian forests in 2002. Fortunately it survived in aviaries, and captive bred birds began to be released back into the wild in 2016 in remote parts of the Big Island; early signs are promising with several pairs attempting to nest. Known to Native Hawaiians as ʻAlalā, it is the only crow or crow-like bird currently found on the archipelago. It is much bigger than the crows found on the US mainland, and is closer in size to a raven. Gives a variety of loud caws, croaks, and squeals."
0,Hawaiian Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas wyvilliana,https://ebird.org/species/hawduc,"A medium-sized duck, similar to female Mallard in appearance, but smaller and darker. Males lack the green head and curled black tail feathers of male Mallards. Both sexes have spotted tail feathers. The bill is dark greenish, with an orange tip in some females. Pure Hawaiian Ducks occur only on Kauai and montane streams and ponds on Hawaii Island. Most or all individuals on other islands are Mallard-Hawaiian Duck hybrids. Occurs in ponds, marshes, taro fields, and streams."
0,Hawaiian Hawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo solitarius,https://ebird.org/species/hawhaw,"A medium-sized, compact hawk with broad wings. It is the only resident hawk in Hawaii and occurs only on Hawaii Island. Raptors seen on other islands are migrants. Coloration varies from all dark to white below and dark above.

0,Hawfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Coccothraustes coccothraustes,https://ebird.org/species/hawfin,"Uncommon to fairly common but rather local, shy, and easily overlooked. Favors mixed and deciduous mature woodland, especially with beech, oak, and hornbeam, where tends to feed and perch quietly, high in the canopy. Also feeds on the ground, mainly in autumn and winter, when forms flocks but usually does not mix with other species. Distinctive appearance, with massive bill (steely gray in summer, pinkish in winter), blue-gray hindneck, like a shawl on orangey head. Broad white tail tip and white wing band show mainly in flight."
0,Hazel Grouse,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetrastes bonasia,https://ebird.org/species/hazgro1,"Distinctive small grouse of dense coniferous forest, preferably with spruces. Usually very difficult to see. Spends most of its time on the ground but flushes with a distinctive wing whirr and may land high in trees. Males have a dark throat and dark tail tip, while females have a speckled white throat and shorter crest. Song of the male is surprisingly high and thin, recalling a Goldcrest."
0,Heard Island Shag,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Leucocarbo nivalis,https://ebird.org/species/heisha1,"A large pied shag with a very white head, neck, and shoulders, a bright blue eye-ring, and a large patch of yellow warty skin in front of the eyes.

Breeding adults have a clean white head that blends seamlessly into the gray neck; nonbreeding adults have smudgy dark streaking on the head. Immatures are entirely dark brown with a yellowish or reddish bill with a dark tip. Almost exclusively coastal; usually seen in flocks loafing on beaches or feeding in nearshore waters. Breeds in Mexico mainly in the Gulf of California; migrates as far north as Washington and British Columbia in winter. Overall dark plumage of immatures might recall a dark-morph jaeger; note Heermann's lacks pale wing flashes and never shows pale mottling on the belly or underwings.
0,Helmet Vanga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Euryceros prevostii,https://ebird.org/species/helvan1,"Huge black vanga with a rufous back and an enormous blue bill. Rare and localized Madagascar endemic that is found in northeastern rainforest at low and middle elevations. Usually in the mid-story, perching motionless for long periods. Often joins flocks with other large vangas. Most easily located when nesting in a large mossy cup that is placed on a forking mid-story branch. Song is a long, delicate, high-pitched, slightly descending trill."
0,Helmeted Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pauxi pauxi,https://ebird.org/species/helcur1,"Large and unmistakable black curassow with a blue-gray helmet on forehead, red bill and legs, white belly, and white tipped tail. Males and most females similar, but some females are of a brown and barred morph. Generally rare in mature montane forest from low to medium elevations. Often in pairs or small groups walking on the forest floor, foraging on fruits and seeds; when alarmed flies to the upper level of the forest, sometimes calling in alarm and other times staying quiet. Vocal during the breeding season; song is a deep, low pitched series of “uhm…UUUUHm…uuuhm;” alarm call is a deep and dry sneezing sound. No similar species in range."
0,Helmeted Friarbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Philemon buceroides,https://ebird.org/species/helfri1,"Large brownish honeyeater with bare black facial skin and a long, pointed, black bill topped by a small rounded ""horn"". Uniformly gray-brown with upperparts a darker shade than the underparts. Care should be taken to distinguish it from Silver-crowned Friarbird (which has an angular edge to the upper rear portion of the black facial skin, as well as a slightly larger ""horn"" on the bill). Also similar is the Noisy Friarbird (which has a completely bare head). Found along the tropical Queensland and Northern Territory coasts—where it can be common in a variety of habitats including parks, gardens, mangroves, and forests. The ""Sandstone"" subspecies in Arnhem Land is quite different in habitat; it occurs in inland sandstone areas.

The distinctive head sports a strange bone-like casque and naked warty facial skin, which is colored white, blue, or red depending on geographic location. Young birds are brown and are almost always found with adults. It is common throughout its range, and large flocks roam the savannas, digging for invertebrates and tubers. Guineafowl often behave like lunatics, charging around issuing a loud and distinctive “kek-kek-kek-kraaaaaaah” alarm. It also calls a distinctive, plaintive “kuuuh-keeerk”. Crested Guineafowl differ from Helmeted Guineafowl by being darker and having a plumed crest on top of the head."
0,Helmeted Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Buceros vigil,https://ebird.org/species/helhor1,"Bizarre-looking bird, now very rare due to poaching for the ivory-like material of its bill. When perched, its most recognizable feature is the naked throat pouch which resembles an undercooked steak, chalky white in the female and dull scarlet in the male. When in flight, its long trailing central tail feathers easily distinguish it from any other hornbill. Scarce and difficult to see; listen for its far-carrying maniacal laugh in mature lowland and foothill forests."
0,Helmeted Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Antilophia galeata,https://ebird.org/species/helman1,"Males are striking with a mostly glossy black body, but with a red forehead, crest, and back.

0,Henderson Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma atrata,https://ebird.org/species/henpet1,"A typical uniformly grayish-brown petrel with pale mottling at the base of the bill that gives it a somewhat “frosted” facial appearance. Pale bar along the leading edge of the underwing between the body and elbow is evident in flight. Highly pelagic, visiting land only to nest. Similar to Kermadec Petrel, but lacks the white primary shafts in the upperwing of that species and is overall more uniformly colored. Providence Petrel is similar but appears much heavier-chested and paler-faced, with more extensively mottled gray-brown tones across the body. Herald Petrel is very similar, but has much more contrasting dark-and-light underwing pattern. Henderson Petrel is silent at sea."

Distinctive color combination of olive-green nape, rufous wings, and crisp black streaks below. Also note large pinkish bill and flat crown. Singing males perch conspicuously in the breeding season; otherwise very secretive, especially in migration and winter. Populations declining sharply, perhaps due to pesticide use and destruction of native grasslands. Listen for its extremely short song, easy to pass off as an insect: “ts-lick.”"
0,Henst's Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter henstii,https://ebird.org/species/hengos1,"A big, powerful goshawk. Adults are gray on the back with fine gray barring below; females much larger. Immatures have a brown back and thick streaks below. Endemic to Madagascar, where it is a scarce resident of all types of primary forest. Rarely sits in the open, and only occasionally soars. Territorial call is a loud repeated “khew” which is often given in flight. Males can be very hard to separate from similarly-sized female Madagascar Sparrowhawk. On Henst’s, look for fine bars on the undertail, a completely barred throat, and a central toe of normal length. Immatures may only be separable based on toe length. Also very similar to the rare Madagascar Serpent-Eagle. Subtle differences include slightly smaller size, evenly-spaced barring on the chest, thicker black bands on the tail, and an unbarred back."
0,Hepatic Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Piranga flava,https://ebird.org/species/heptan,"Large, stocky tanager. Males are red with dusty wash on upperparts and sides (especially on northern populations); females are muted yellowish. Both sexes are brightest on the throat and crown. Also note stout bill and dark lores. Several separate populations occur from the southwestern U.S. to South America, probably comprising multiple different species.

Rusty-brown overall with blurry streaking on the breast. Found in wetland habitat, primarily reedbeds. Extremely secretive and skulking. Most often seen when it sits up to sing or gives a short display flight. Song starts with slow, hesitant, buzzy metallic notes that speed up, then ends with a trill made by beating the wings together at incredible speed. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed-warblers and swamp-warblers. Very similar to Little Rush Warbler, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Highland sings a much higher-pitched song."
0,Highland Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothocercus bonapartei,https://ebird.org/species/higtin1,"Rotund chickenlike bird, far more often heard than seen. Like a dove but body is even more circular and tail shorter.

Moves around in convoys through dense vegetation in mid- to high-altitude forests."
0,Hill Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba rupestris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpig1,"Very similar in appearance to the wild-type Rock Pigeon, this flocking species inhabits open valleys and gorges also visits towns and cities. More pale-headed than Rock Pigeon, but the key distinguishing trait is a broad white stripe across its dark tail which is visible both in flight and when perched; the wild-type Rock Pigeon has a dark-tipped gray tail with no white. Forages on the ground in large flocks; can be quite tame and accommodating towards human presence."
0,Hill Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpri2,"A large, fierce-eyed prinia with a long, oft-cocked tail. Breeding adults have a gray head, white throat and brow, brown upperparts, and pale, brown-washed underparts. Nonbreeding adults lack the gray but retain the white brow and throat. May be confused at a distance with Yellow-bellied Prinia, but is much larger, and has a more extensive brow and no bright yellow anywhere on the body. Usually found in open, scrubby habitats, including overgrown fields and forest edges. Loud, strident song consists of one high liquid-sounding note being repeated over and over."
0,Hill Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Hirundo domicola,https://ebird.org/species/pacswa3,"A small dark blue-black swallow with rufous-chestnut on its face and a short tail. Except for a black triangular eye-stripe extending to the bill, the entire forehead, chin, throat, and upper breast are rufous-chestnut, without any dark necklace like that of Barn Swallow, the main confusion species. Hill Swallow’s dark upperparts have a blue-green sheen that is only visible when seen up close, while the underparts are dingy white with ashy-gray on the flanks. Juveniles have duller chestnut on the face. Mainly inhabits open areas such as grasslands, reservoirs, and tea estates in the high hills above 500 meters of elevation; very rare at lower elevations. Often seen wheeling and looping in the air after insects, with a swift flight action reminiscent of a Barn Swallow with a shorter tail."
0,Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus pulcherrimus,https://ebird.org/species/bearos1,"A rather dark and heavily marked rosefinch. Male is dark rosy-pink below and dark, streaky brown above with a dark pink brow. Female is brown and streaky with underparts streaking extending from the throat (where the streaks are extremely fine) to the belly (where the streaks are heavier and longer). Females also have a faint pale brow, but it is weak and not always noticeable; note the far more contrasting brow of Chinese and Himalayan White-browed Rosefinches. Inhabits montane and hilly scrub, forest edges, and village outskirts. Gives twitters and trills. The extremely similar Chinese Beautiful Rosefinch gives sharper and more metallic call notes than the Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch."
0,Himalayan Bluetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Tarsiger rufilatus,https://ebird.org/species/himblu1,"Brightly-colored adult male is unmistakable in range: blazing sapphire blue with orange flanks and white throat and belly. Female is brown with a white throat, orange flanks, and pale blue rump and tail. Red-flanked Bluetail can be confusing where the two overlap in the latter’s migratory and winter range; note Himalayan’s brighter blue eyebrow and brighter, deeper blue upperparts in the male. Female is slightly more grayish than Red-flanked, but this identification can be much more difficult, and females may not be safely separable if not with male. Himalayan’s song is a simple, repeated “tcher-thcew-wee!”. Breeds in submontane forest up to the treeline; descends in the winter, often moving into edge habitats. A frequent sight along forest tracks."
0,Himalayan Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus leucogenys,https://ebird.org/species/whcbul2,"Sharp-looking bulbul with a spiffy mohawk. Note black face and throat, bright white cheek spot, and yellow vent. A species of foothill and montane forested areas; also found in brush, gardens, and towns. Tame and unafraid of people. Typically in pairs or small flocks during the breeding season; congregates in large flocks at other times. Song is a short and rather nasal-sounding burst of gurgling warbles. Calls include dry raspings, chups, and squeaks."
0,Himalayan Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo refectus,https://ebird.org/species/combuz9,"A large hawk with a confusing range and unclear identification criteria. Resident in the Himalayas and a breeder in adjacent areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A large “typical” buzzard, brown overall with blotchy patterning on the breast, dark upper “trousers,” and dark “elbows” and trailing edge on the underwing. Juvenile streakier below with a more finely barred tail and paler trailing edge. Compare with extremely similar Upland and Eastern Buzzards; note less eagle-like proportions than Upland, as well as marginally darker “trousers” and more prominent trailing edge than Eastern."
0,Himalayan Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Cuculus saturatus,https://ebird.org/species/himcuc1,"Visually indistinguishable from Oriental Cuckoo. Adult male is gray above with a black-and-white-barred belly and a dark gray tail; females usually look similar, but some (known as hepatic morph birds) have cinnamon-brown upperparts with black barring throughout. Intermediate in size between Common and Lesser Cuckoos; distinguished from both species by buffy (not white) under-tail feathers and from Lesser Cuckoos by yellow iris. Song is a series of five notes, with the leading note being sharper and more distinct than the four that follow; compare with Oriental Cuckoo’s series of mellow paired notes. Breeds in a wide range of different lowland and hill forests; also more open habitats outside of breeding season."
0,Himalayan Cutia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Cutia nipalensis,https://ebird.org/species/cutia1,"A beautiful, stocky inhabitant of high-elevation broadleaf and mixed forests. Looks like a babbler, but much more closely related to laughingthrushes. Male has a black mask, blue-gray crown, white throat, barred sides, and bright rufous back. Female is paler, with a brown face and a more yellowish back lined with black streaks. Forages at middle and upper levels, often in small groups, picking invertebrates from leaf clusters, ferns and orchids, and mossy crevices of trunks and branches. Listen for its loud song, an extended series of high-pitched, piercing “chee!” notes."
0,Himalayan Flameback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dinopium shorii,https://ebird.org/species/himfla1,"A large woodpecker with a brilliant orange back, a black stripe through the eye and cheek, and black on the back of the neck. Inhabits mature lowland forest. It looks for invertebrates in trees, meticulously working its way up from the base of the trunk. Not shy; often mixes with other species, especially babblers and laughingthrushes. Very similar to Common Flameback, but the Himalayan Flameback has a longer bill and the cheek stripe splits into two near the bill. The call is a tinny, nasal series of notes similar to those of other flamebacks."
0,Himalayan Monal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophophorus impejanus,https://ebird.org/species/himmon1,"Decked out in all the colors of the rainbow, the male is the image of iridescence; green crested head, red neck, green shoulders, blue back, orange tail, and black underparts. When displaying or flushed, flashes a bright white patch on the back. Female is nowhere near as brightly-colored, with a pale blue eye patch, white throat, and streaky brown body. Found in Himalayan hill forest, typically in areas with extensive rhododendron and bamboo-dominated understory."
0,Himalayan Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix nivicolum,https://ebird.org/species/himowl1,"A medium-sized brownish owl of montane forests, generally uncommon. Brownish overall with finely patterned underparts. Deep black eyes bracketed by bright white arcs impart a learned, severe expression. Asian counterpart to Europe's Tawny Owl. Calls loudly and slowly, a repeated pair of hoots."
0,Himalayan Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia crinigera,https://ebird.org/species/strpri2,"A rather dull-plumaged songbird of fields, grasslands, forest edges, and farmland, mostly at moderate and high elevations. Often sparsely distributed and difficult to find. Gray-brown above with a pale belly and blackish streaking on head and wings. Breeding males become black-billed and darker on the face, losing the pale eyebrow that is usually shown in other plumages. Typically found singly or in pairs, clambering about in grasses and shrubbery. Often sings from an exposed perch, giving a loud but dry, rolling series of notes, slower than the song of Striped Prinia. Visually very similar to Striped Prinia, but usually separated by range. In the area of overlap, female and non-breeding male Himalayan Prinias show weaker streaking on the back and a duller rufous panel in the wings. Breeding males are distinguished by their darker faces without an eye-stripe. Also similar to Burmese Prinia, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Himalayan Prinia is distinguished by having more streaking, especially along the sides of the breast."
0,Himalayan Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Ophrysia superciliosa,https://ebird.org/species/himqua1,"Extinct, last reported in 1876. Formerly west central Himalayas."
0,Himalayan Rubythroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/himrub1,"Shy inhabitant of thickets and dense grassy areas from subalpine scrub to above treeline. Male is gunmetal gray with a white brow, bright orange throat, and a black patch extending from the face down to the breast. Very similar to the closely related Chinese Rubythroat, which has a white moustachial stripe. Chinese Rubythroat female averages browner than female Himalayan, but is best identified by range; Chinese breeds in central and south-central China, while Himalayan breeds along the Himalayas, in Xinjiang, and in Central Asia. Female Himalayan has a weaker eyebrow than female Siberian Rubythroat, and is darker overall."
0,Himalayan Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx cruralis,https://ebird.org/species/whbsho4,"Tiny, stumpy bird of dense undergrowth. Male is dark slate-blue with broad white eyebrows that give him the appearance of a furious little old man. Female is warm pale brown all over. In areas of overlap with Chinese and Lesser Shortwings, look out for the all-dark lower belly, which is white in those species. Inhabits hill and montane forest, where it forages in dense undergrowth, frequently in proximity to streams. Song is composed of high thin whistles with short bursts of clicking chattering mixed in."
0,Himalayan Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus himalayensis,https://ebird.org/species/himsno,"A hulking game bird of rocky mountain slopes and cliffsides. Native to the Himalayas and adjacent mountain ranges, but has also been introduced in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada. Gray overall with patchy brown streaking on the breast and two dark brown lines running down the neck. Can be somewhat tame in protected areas, coming down to monasteries for food, especially during the winter."
0,Himalayan Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus brevirostris,https://ebird.org/species/himswi2,"Gray-brown swiftlet with a pale gray rump and a squared-off tail. The westernmost ranging species in the genus and the only member throughout much of its range. Smaller than most other swifts in range except for House Swift, which is black overall with a sharp white rump and throat. Tends to travel in small to medium-sized flocks, often swooping low over bodies of water. Builds dark bowl-shaped nests in closely-clustered colonies under rocky overhangs, in caves, and in old buildings. Gives clicking calls and twitters, especially when near colonies."
0,Himalayan Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera salimalii,https://ebird.org/species/himthr1,"A mysterious and range-restricted thrush the color of rich caramel. Dark brown above with densely black-scaled underparts, white eye-ring, and uniform upperparts. Extremely similar to Sichuan and Alpine Thrushes; averages darker above, heavier-billed, and stockier-looking. Breeds in eastern Himalayan forests at around 3000-4000 meters; winters down to around 1450 meters. Gives a typical ringing, melodic thrush song."
0,Himalayan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos himalayensis,https://ebird.org/species/himwoo1,"A relatively large woodpecker with a black back, a white patch on the shoulders, and white spots on the flight feathers. A distinctive black stripe runs around the ears to the base of the bill. The top of the male’s head is red, while the female’s is black. Usually solitary or in pairs, searching for invertebrates along the trunks of trees in oak, pine, and mixed forests. Calls include metallic grating notes, a single-noted “chuck,” and short, rapid rolls of drumming."
0,Hinde's Pied-Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides hindei,https://ebird.org/species/hipbab1,"A dark babbler with abundant scaly markings and red-orange eyes. The exact pattern and coloration are extremely variable. The underparts can be mostly black with white scaling, or mostly white with dark scaling. There is often rufous on the rump and undertail, and sometimes elsewhere. Found very locally at middle elevations in central Kenya, in thickets, remnant natural forest, and scrub dominated by exotic species. Almost always in small groups, which feed by hopping across the ground. Easily separated from other babblers in its range by the abundant and variable scaling. Usually located by the raspy babbling call, typically given by a whole group in chorus."
0,Hispaniolan Crossbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxia megaplaga,https://ebird.org/species/hiscro,"A gregarious species of montane pine forests. This species can be deceptively hard to find when not calling, despite its bright colors and tendency to travel in flocks of up to twenty. Note that the namesake crossed bill can be hard to see. Males are clothed in red and bear bright white wingbars. The dull yellow-olive female can be separated from other species by its bold white wingbars and structure: the bill is stout and the tail is short and notched. Call is loud “djit, djit.” Its song is a soft series of warblings and trills."
0,Hispaniolan Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Riccordia swainsonii,https://ebird.org/species/hiseme1,"An inhabitant of moist montane woodlands including coffee plantations. The long-tailed male is distinctively entirely iridescent green and the base of the bill is red. The female is metallic green above, dingy white below, and has a relatively long, forked tail. The Antillean Mango is shorter tailed (wings just about even with tail tip when perched) and has a distinctly down-curved bill. The Vervain Hummingbird is much smaller and shorter billed than the Hispaniolan Emerald. Most common vocalization is a sharp “tic,” most often given in a prolonged series at about five “tics” per second."
0,Hispaniolan Lizard-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus longirostris,https://ebird.org/species/hislic1,"An impressive long-tailed species of wooded habitats including shade coffee plantations. Typically found foraging in dense vegetation from understory to canopy; can be found sunning in the open at first light with its tail spread. Note this species long straight narrow bill, brilliant red eyering, gray chest, and buff-orange belly. The Bay-breasted Cuckoo is similarly shaped but is larger with a maroon chest and short curved bill. The Mangrove Cuckoo is smaller with a smaller curved bill and a black mask. Secretive, but not shy, this species is often first detected by its voice: a long, rapid, ratcheting “keh-keh-keh…” Also gives a low “craaa” and a sharp “chek.”"
0,Hispaniolan Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/graori1,"A sleek forest bird that sometimes ventures into gardens and parks in search of flowers and fruit; prefers areas with palms. The adult is distinctive—clothed in black except for patches of yellow on lower belly, shoulders, and rump. No similar species occur within its range. Immatures are muddled yellow, orange, and olive, developing adult plumage over the course of a year. This plumage resembles that of female and young Baltimore Orioles, a scarce migrant and winter visitor to Hispaniola. Similarly attired Baltimore Orioles can be distinguished by their orange underparts and white wingbars. The song is a rapid jumble of squeaky and metallic notes. Calls include a buzzy “jrrrt” and a metallic “zhwee.”"
0,Hispaniolan Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacara chloropterus,https://ebird.org/species/hispar,"A sleek, medium-large, gregarious species of woodlands that sometimes ventures into agricultural and urban areas. Its overall green plumage, long, pointed tail, and stout bill eliminate all other species in range. In overflight, it often appears green with a red slash on each forewing. Most common call is a series of squeaks that takes on a twittering quality when given by an excited flock."
0,Hispaniolan Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus hispaniolensis,https://ebird.org/species/hispew1,"A small drab inhabitant of woodlands including orchards and coffee plantations; typically “flycatches” from a low perch and returns to the same perch. This species is perhaps most notable in its lack of field marks, including lack of wingbars and facial markings. The Stolid Flycatcher is much larger and has wingbars and the Greater Antillean Elaenia has bold wingbars and a dull eyering. Rather unvocal for a pewee; most common call is a repeated mellow “pip”."
0,Hispaniolan Spindalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Spindalidae,Spindalis dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/hisspi,"A somewhat small woodland bird that moves rather deliberately as it feeds on fruits and flowers and the occasional insect. Occupies wide range of forests from pines to mangroves. Brilliant male looks like a sunrise with a black-and-white head; no truly similar species on Hispaniola. Females head pattern is a dull version of the males, but note streaking below. Calls are a high and thin single “tsee” or rapid “tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi.”"
0,Hispaniolan Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Priotelus roseigaster,https://ebird.org/species/histro1,"This strikingly colored denizen of montane woodlands (and less often, mangrove swamps) is rather sedate. It is often found sitting upright and rather motionless, typically in paris. One's first impression is often of a rather long and largish bird with a brilliant red belly, emerald back, and blackish head. No similar species occur within its range. Song is a tremulous “whut-will,” with second note longer and trailing off at end. The first note is sometimes omitted and second note is sometimes given as doublet or triplet. Calls include a shrill “whee” and soft coos. Though rather vocal, calling birds are difficult to locate due ventriloquial quality of their vocalizations."
0,Hispaniolan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes striatus,https://ebird.org/species/hiswoo1,"A noisy and gregarious woodpecker that inhabits most wooded habitats. It is a striking species with a bold yellow-and-black barred back, a red crown, and a gray face with staring yellow eye. In flight, note the bright red rump. No similar species occur in its range. Vocalizations include a squeaky ""wick, wick, wick, wick…"", a sputtering ""du-du-du-du-du..."", and a squeaky, sometimes drawn out, whinny."
0,Hoary Puffleg,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Haplophaedia lugens,https://ebird.org/species/hoapuf1,"Dull hummingbird restricted to mid-elevation Andean cloud forest in northwestern Ecuador and western Colombia. Mostly green, but underparts are grayer with white scaling; also note coppery tinge to crown and rump. White leg puffs are usually conspicuous on male, but they are much smaller on female and immature and can be concealed behind belly feathers. Scarce; usually encountered feeding low inside forest, often near streams."
0,Hoatzin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Opisthocomiformes,Opisthocomidae,Opisthocomus hoazin,https://ebird.org/species/hoatzi1,"Large, dumpy bird found around lake edges and slow-moving streams. Head looks too small for its large brown body. Its orange mohawk, blue facial skin, and stubby bill make this bird extremely distinctive. Usually found in groups or pairs. Moves clumsily around waterside vegetation, making loud huffing noises."
0,Hodgson's Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/hodfro1,"Cryptic, uncommon nightbird of evergreen and mixed foothill and montane forests (900-2000 meters). Both sexes have dappled lichen-like plumage, the male grayish, female rusty brown. Silent birds are best distinguished from other small frogmouths by range, habitat, elevation, and bird’s comparatively small size. Song a long, haunting whistle, given repeatedly in series."
0,Hodgson's Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Phoenicurus hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/hodred1,"Male very similar in appearance to Daurian Redstart; note more restricted silver on the forehead and less distinct wing panel. Female’s lack of a white wing patch distinguishes her from female Daurian, and she averages paler than female Black Redstart, with a brighter eye-ring. Blue-fronted Redstart female can be similar; Hodgson’s female is colder-toned with a single dark stripe down the tail instead of Blue-fronted’s inverted “T.” Hodgson’s breeds in hilly and montane open forests and forest edge; descends in the winter, favoring scrubby edge."
0,Hoffmanns's Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Dendrocolaptes hoffmannsi,https://ebird.org/species/hofwoo2,"Large woodcreeper with a strong black bill. Dark chestnut-brown overall. Note the very fine bars on the head and underparts and the cinnamon crown. Found in the interior of humid forest and second growth, sometimes venturing to the forest edges, and regularly attending army-ant swarms. The song is a rolling series of “wutwutwut…” notes like the song of the closely-related Black-banded Woodcreeper, but the two probably don’t overlap in range. The similar Amazonian Barred-Woodcreeper has a dark red-brown bill."
0,Holub's Golden-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus xanthops,https://ebird.org/species/hogwea1,"Large weaver with a heavy black bill and pale eyes. Juveniles dull, with brown eyes; they can be identified by their overall structure and tendency to associate with more distinctive adults. Found in savanna, woodland, scrub, and cultivation. Usually nests near water. Vocalizations are typical of weavers, “chek” notes and a sizzling “radio static” song, though somewhat lower-pitched. Other golden-weavers are smaller and don’t have pale eyes."
0,Honduran Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia luciae,https://ebird.org/species/honeme1,"Fairly small hummingbird with very limited range in dry valleys of Honduras.

Males have a white eye and females a dark one. Both sexes show a large white patch in the outer tail. Found in the upper portions of lowland forest. Usually in pairs or small groups. Most often detected by call: a slow series of mewing whistles. Similar to Sjöstedt's Greenbul, but has darker gray underparts, and male further distinguished by its pale eye. Distinguished from honeyguides by its different shape, especially the longer tail. Flight is direct, unlike undulating flight of a honeyguide."
0,Hooded Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaricula cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/hooant1,"Rare antpitta known only from a few scattered sites. Small and quite distinctive with a chestnut hood and yellow bill contrasting with its otherwise brown and gray plumage. Inhabits cloud forest understory, and unlike most larger antpittas, it spends very little time on the ground, typically perching about three to six feet up. Typical vocalization is a shrill, high-pitched whistle given once every five to ten seconds."
0,Hooded Berryeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Carpornis cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/hoober2,"Big and chunky rainforest cotinga with a long tail. Found in the canopy of montane forests where it can be locally common, but hard to see. Striking plumage with a black head, yellow collar and belly, and a chestnut back with black and yellow edging to the wings. The iris is dark brown. Females are similar but duller. The song is a distinctive and far-carrying explosive whistled “wreep-wrepoo.”"
0,Hooded Butcherbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Artamidae,Cracticus cassicus,https://ebird.org/species/hoobut1,"A large, pied bird of lowland and foothill secondary forest and edges. Note the distinctive black hood extending to the chest, Also black back, edge to the wing and end of the tail. The rest of the plumage is white. Long, silvery bill with black tip.

0,Hooded Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus cornix,https://ebird.org/species/hoocro1,"Common in varied open and semiopen habitats from towns and farmland to open woodland and moorland; replaced to south and west by Carrion Crow. Found in pairs or small groups, not usually in large flocks except at roosts. Unless seen in poor light or at a distance, plumage is distinctive, with ashy gray body, contrasting black head, wings, and tail. With distant flying birds, note that ravens soar and glide readily, whereas crows typically just flap along."
0,Hooded Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina longicauda,https://ebird.org/species/hoocus1,"A large, fairly long-tailed bird of montane forest canopy. Pale gray plumage with black flight feathers and tail. Male has a full black hood and upper chest, while the female has just a black face and throat. Similar to Black-faced Cuckooshrike but should be separated by habitat and elevation. Voice, repeated, loud, downslurred, grating calls “gerrr! gerrr! gerrr!” somewhat reminiscent of a Blue Jay."

0,Hooded Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps gallardoi,https://ebird.org/species/hoogre1,"A beautiful, small grebe of Patagonia that is rare, local, and declining; breeds on a few interior lakes. Nonbreeding birds range to coastal waters and lowland lakes, where they are most often seen in the company of Silvery Grebes. Told from Silvery Grebe by more contrasting head pattern: black hood contrasts with white forehead and golden tiara, often striking at long range. Grebes are very rarely seen in flight, but wings of Hooded are mostly white unlike the dark wings with a white hind patch seen on Silvery Grebe."
0,Hooded Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Coccothraustes abeillei,https://ebird.org/species/hoogro1,"Handsome, chunky finch of humid evergreen and pine-evergreen forest in foothills and highlands.

Very colorful, with greenish wings, mostly blue underparts, an azure collar, and a yellow bill with a black tip and black spot near the base. It occurs south of the range of Gray-breasted Mountain-Toucan, which has a very different bill pattern. Typically encountered in pairs or small groups in the forest canopy, where it sometimes gives rising squeals, short yaps, and harsh rattles."
0,Hooded Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus cucullatus,https://ebird.org/species/hooori,"Rather slender, long-tailed oriole. Adult males are orange with a black mask and throat and obvious white shoulder patch. Variable color intensity: Eastern birds (from Texas to the Yucatan Peninsula) are brighter orange; Western birds are more yellow. Females are dull yellow with a grayish wash on the upperparts and sides. Immature males are similar to females, but brighter yellow and with a black throat. Occurs in open woodlands and scrub in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. Often seen in parks and neighborhoods, with an affinity for palm trees. Visits feeders with nectar and fruits. Most similar to female Orchard Oriole, but note the longer, more decurved bill."
0,Hooded Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Psephotus dissimilis,https://ebird.org/species/hoopar1,"A slender and long-tailed parrot restricted to a relatively small range in the Northern Territory, where it inhabits open woodlands. Male a striking turquoise color with black cap, yellow wings, rosy undertail coverts, and olive back. Female primarily pale green with turquoise underparts except for rosy undertail coverts. Slenderer and longer-tailed than Red-winged Parrot and Northern Rosella, with bright yellow shoulders obvious in flight. This species digs tunnels in termite mounds in order to breed. Calls include a sharp ""chit."""
0,Hooded Pitohui,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Pitohui dichrous,https://ebird.org/species/hoopit1,"A medium-sized bird of foothill and lower montane forest and edge. Tawny colored body with black head, chest, wing and tail. Remeniscent of Orchard Oriole. Almost identical to some races of Southern and Northern Variable Pitohui but Hooded is usually found at higher altitude. Hooded is best told by voice which is usually lower. Voice, a complex array of low, oriolelike warbles, wolf-whistles and clicks. Some vocalizations sound like “pi-to-hui”."
0,Hooded Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Pitta sordida,https://ebird.org/species/hoopit2,"A dark-headed beauty of tropical forests. Black head is topped with a chestnut crown in some subspecies. Body is emerald green with a bright blue patch on the shoulder and a crimson belly. Quietly forages singly for invertebrates on the ground. Like almost all pittas, shy and retiring and generally very difficult to see. Song is variable, but generally undistinguished: two primary notes, typically with a barking quality, and sometimes with quieter additional notes."
0,Heard Island Shag,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Leucocarbo nivalis,https://ebird.org/species/heisha1,"A large pied shag with a very white head, neck, and shoulders, a bright blue eye-ring, and a large patch of yellow warty skin in front of the eyes. Breeding adult has a wispy crest. Marine, breeding on cliffs and in tussock grassland. No other similar birds occur within its limited range. Loud barking and honking are the most common vocalizations."
0,Heermann's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus heermanni,https://ebird.org/species/heegul,Unique smoky-gray gull with red bill. Breeding adults have a clean white head that blends seamlessly into the gray neck; nonbreeding adults have smudgy dark streaking on the head. Immatures are entirely dark brown with a yellowish or reddish bill with a dark tip. Almost exclusively coastal; usually seen in flocks loafing on beaches or feeding in nearshore waters. Breeds in Mexico mainly in the Gulf of California; migrates as far north as Washington and British Columbia in winter. Overall dark plumage of immatures might recall a dark-morph jaeger; note Heermann's lacks pale wing flashes and never shows pale mottling on the belly or underwings.
0,Heinroth's Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus heinrothi,https://ebird.org/species/heishe1,"A small, distinctively proportioned shearwater with a comparatively long-necked, long-tailed, round-winged appearance. Entirely dark plumage contrasts with variably white bars on the underside of remarkably short, stubby wings. Long thin bill is often obvious, as is this species’ habit of flying with its head raised above its body. Pale morph is paler below and overall lighter brown, but retains odd proportions. The dark morph of Wedge-tailed Shearwater is somewhat similar, but much larger and longer-tailed. Black Noddy is similar in size, but has a more buoyant, bouncy tern-like flight. Christmas Shearwater is most similar, but has a proportionally shorter bill and tail. Short-tailed and Sooty Shearwaters are similar in plumage, but their toes project beyond their tail, unlike in Heinroth’s Shearwater."
0,Hellmayr's Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus hellmayri,https://ebird.org/species/helpip1,"Uncommon pipit found in grasslands, dry rocky areas, and less frequently in low intensity agricultural habitats. It has a heavily streaked back with a white throat and pale belly. Note the lightly streaked breast and flanks. Similar to Short-billed Pipit, but lacks the white mustache and has streaky flanks. Sings a series of buzzy nasal notes perched or in flight."
0,Helmet Vanga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Euryceros prevostii,https://ebird.org/species/helvan1,"Huge black vanga with a rufous back and an enormous blue bill. Rare and localized Madagascar endemic that is found in northeastern rainforest at low and middle elevations. Usually in the mid-story, perching motionless for long periods. Often joins flocks with other large vangas. Most easily located when nesting in a large mossy cup that is placed on a forking mid-story branch. Song is a long, delicate, high-pitched, slightly descending trill."
0,Helmeted Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pauxi pauxi,https://ebird.org/species/helcur1,"Large and unmistakable black curassow with a blue-gray helmet on forehead, red bill and legs, white belly, and white tipped tail. Males and most females similar, but some females are of a brown and barred morph. Generally rare in mature montane forest from low to medium elevations. Often in pairs or small groups walking on the forest floor, foraging on fruits and seeds; when alarmed flies to the upper level of the forest, sometimes calling in alarm and other times staying quiet. Vocal during the breeding season; song is a deep, low pitched series of “uhm…UUUUHm…uuuhm;” alarm call is a deep and dry sneezing sound. No similar species in range."
0,Helmeted Friarbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Philemon buceroides,https://ebird.org/species/helfri1,"Large brownish honeyeater with bare black facial skin and a long, pointed, black bill topped by a small rounded ""horn"". Uniformly gray-brown with upperparts a darker shade than the underparts. Care should be taken to distinguish it from Silver-crowned Friarbird (which has an angular edge to the upper rear portion of the black facial skin, as well as a slightly larger ""horn"" on the bill). Also similar is the Noisy Friarbird (which has a completely bare head). Found along the tropical Queensland and Northern Territory coasts—where it can be common in a variety of habitats including parks, gardens, mangroves, and forests. The ""Sandstone"" subspecies in Arnhem Land is quite different in habitat; it occurs in inland sandstone areas. Typically very loud, with has a variety of harsh, loud squawks, including the ""poor devil"" call."
0,Helmeted Guineafowl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Numididae,Numida meleagris,https://ebird.org/species/helgui,"A large-bodied, small-headed, slaty-gray gamebird perfectly lined with rows of hundreds of white spots. The distinctive head sports a strange bone-like casque and naked warty facial skin, which is colored white, blue, or red depending on geographic location. Young birds are brown and are almost always found with adults. It is common throughout its range, and large flocks roam the savannas, digging for invertebrates and tubers. Guineafowl often behave like lunatics, charging around issuing a loud and distinctive “kek-kek-kek-kraaaaaaah” alarm. It also calls a distinctive, plaintive “kuuuh-keeerk”. Crested Guineafowl differ from Helmeted Guineafowl by being darker and having a plumed crest on top of the head."
0,Helmeted Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Buceros vigil,https://ebird.org/species/helhor1,"Bizarre-looking bird, now very rare due to poaching for the ivory-like material of its bill. When perched, its most recognizable feature is the naked throat pouch which resembles an undercooked steak, chalky white in the female and dull scarlet in the male. When in flight, its long trailing central tail feathers easily distinguish it from any other hornbill. Scarce and difficult to see; listen for its far-carrying maniacal laugh in mature lowland and foothill forests."
0,Helmeted Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Antilophia galeata,https://ebird.org/species/helman1,"Males are striking with a mostly glossy black body, but with a red forehead, crest, and back. Females are uniformly olive-green and also crested. Locally common in gallery forests embedded in savannas where it often accompanies mixed-species flocks. The song is a trilling series of alternately soft and loud whistles."
0,Helmeted Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Basilornis galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/helmyn1,"A glossy-black starling with a big permanently raised crest that gives it a unique, broad-headed profile. Also note prominent whitish markings on sides of neck and breast, which appear like one large patch. Juvenile shorter-crested, with a brown chin and a bicolored bill. Frequents the canopy of lowland and hill forest in small groups or pairs, preferring pristine areas, but straying into edges and degraded patches too. Complex song involves whirring “weee-ow-weee-ow” mixed with “chur” and “chip” notes. Also gives a single, strident metallic “chip” call."
0,Helmeted Pygmy-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Lophotriccus galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/heptyr1,"Tiny flycatcher; common and widespread, but heard far more often than seen. When seen well, note pale eye and elongated crown feathers, giving this bird a hammer-headed appearance. Found in humid forest understory and second-growth as well as in savanna woodland. Frequently found near gaps and vine tangles where it sits quietly, then sallies upward to glean insects from leaves. Song is an irregular series of ticking notes that sometimes runs into a trill, often given for long periods throughout the day. Similar to Double-banded Pygmy-Tyrant, but vocalizations are less buzzy."
0,Helmeted Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Celeus galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/helwoo1,"Fairly large woodpecker. A usually rare inhabitant of extensive humid forests.

0,Henderson Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma atrata,https://ebird.org/species/henpet1,"A typical uniformly grayish-brown petrel with pale mottling at the base of the bill that gives it a somewhat “frosted” facial appearance. Pale bar along the leading edge of the underwing between the body and elbow is evident in flight. Highly pelagic, visiting land only to nest. Similar to Kermadec Petrel, but lacks the white primary shafts in the upperwing of that species and is overall more uniformly colored. Providence Petrel is similar but appears much heavier-chested and paler-faced, with more extensively mottled gray-brown tones across the body. Herald Petrel is very similar, but has much more contrasting dark-and-light underwing pattern. Henderson Petrel is silent at sea."
0,Henderson Island Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus taiti,https://ebird.org/species/hirwar1,"A large warbler with a variably white head and body. Crown and uppersides often mottled olive-brown and white, underside often tinted yellow. Wing feathers and tail darker. Found in undisturbed forest. Common call is a high-pitched single note.

0,Henslow's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Centronyx henslowii,https://ebird.org/species/henspa,"A large-headed and thick-billed sparrow, found exclusively in weedy grasslands with sparse shrubs. Distinctive color combination of olive-green nape, rufous wings, and crisp black streaks below. Also note large pinkish bill and flat crown. Singing males perch conspicuously in the breeding season; otherwise very secretive, especially in migration and winter. Populations declining sharply, perhaps due to pesticide use and destruction of native grasslands. Listen for its extremely short song, easy to pass off as an insect: “ts-lick.”"
0,Henst's Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter henstii,https://ebird.org/species/hengos1,"A big, powerful goshawk. Adults are gray on the back with fine gray barring below; females much larger. Immatures have a brown back and thick streaks below. Endemic to Madagascar, where it is a scarce resident of all types of primary forest. Rarely sits in the open, and only occasionally soars. Territorial call is a loud repeated “khew” which is often given in flight. Males can be very hard to separate from similarly-sized female Madagascar Sparrowhawk. On Henst’s, look for fine bars on the undertail, a completely barred throat, and a central toe of normal length. Immatures may only be separable based on toe length. Also very similar to the rare Madagascar Serpent-Eagle. Subtle differences include slightly smaller size, evenly-spaced barring on the chest, thicker black bands on the tail, and an unbarred back."

Males are red with dusty wash on upperparts and sides (especially on northern populations); females are muted yellowish. Both sexes are brightest on the throat and crown. Also note stout bill and dark lores. Several separate populations occur from the southwestern U.S. to South America, probably comprising multiple different species. Northern birds prefer mountainous areas with mixed pine-oak forest. South American birds found in a variety of forested habitats, from open woodlands in the lowlands to scrubby areas in the high Andes. Most similar to Summer Tanager, but grayer tones to plumage and usually different habitat. Song is sweet like American Robin: mostly clear phrases with some hoarser notes."
0,Herald Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma heraldica,https://ebird.org/species/herpet2,"Medium-sized, lightly built petrel of offshore tropical waters across the Pacific; not seen from mainland. Plumage is highly variable (from white-bodied and dark-headed to wholly dark) and often very similar to larger and broader-winged Kermadec Petrel, which has a shorter and broader tail than Herald. Herald has white flashes on underside of wingtips, but lacks white shafts on upperside, which are diagnostic of Kermadec. Both species visit colonies in daytime, when pairs chase around high overhead."
0,Herero Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis herero,https://ebird.org/species/hercha1,"Brown chat with a dark face mask, a pale eyebrow, and very faint streaking on the underparts. Found very locally in a specific microhabitat: the bands of somewhat lusher woodland around the base of rocky escarpments at the edge of the Namib Desert. Usually in pairs. Quiet but distinctive song is a four-note series of mournful whistles. Fairly similar to Familiar Chat, but easily separated by bold face pattern."
0,Hermit Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Catharus guttatus,https://ebird.org/species/herthr,"Medium brown above with contrasting reddish tail. Dark spots on breast do not continue all the way down belly like Wood Thrush. Found in wooded areas; often hops on the ground or skulks in dense patches of shrubbery. Winters further north than other thrushes; many stay in the U.S. Listen for its beautiful song that is higher pitched than other thrushes with a steady introductory note; also gives low ""chup"" call note."
0,Hermit Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga occidentalis,https://ebird.org/species/herwar,"Yellow-faced warbler of western coniferous forests. Males are almost entirely yellow-headed with black nape and throat, gray upperparts with white wingbars, and whitish underparts. Females much duller with pale throat and dingy gray belly, and always show a blank yellow face (some with faint olive cheek patch). Hybridizes with Townsend's Warbler where ranges overlap. Favors conifers on breeding and wintering grounds. Migrants found in a variety of wooded habitats. Feeds on insects, often high in treetops."
0,Hermit Wood-Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Henicorhina anachoreta,https://ebird.org/species/gybwow3,"Small, short-tailed wren endemic to the Santa Marta Mountains of Colombia. It has a white eyebrow and streaky face, though plumage is almost identical to that of Gray-breasted Wood-Wren. It can be identified by its faster, squeakier, and higher-pitched song, and it generally occurs at higher elevations with little overlap. Usually found in pairs that stay low in cloud forest understory. Quite common in the upper parts of El Dorado Nature Reserve, but not found near the lodge."
0,Heuglin's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Neotis heuglinii,https://ebird.org/species/heubus1,"A fairly large and lanky bustard. Males have a mostly black face, females a striped face. Both sexes have a gray neck and white belly. In flight, the wing is pale brown and black above and mostly pale below. A generally scarce species that is found in dry savanna, scrub, and other semi-desert habitats. Often in pairs. Similar to White-bellied Bustard, but the male is distinguished by his dark rather than pinkish bill, and the female by her gray rather than brownish neck."
0,Heuglin's Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus heuglini,https://ebird.org/species/hemwea1,"A small, yellow-eyed masked-weaver with a plain green back. The breeding male has a black face mask extending to a point on the upper breast, without a chestnut wash around the mask. Female and juvenile are duller, with a buff wash on the breast and a lightly streaked back. A fairly common resident throughout open savanna and semi-arid areas, often nesting colonially near ant and wasp nests. Many similar-looking weavers do not overlap in range with Heuglin’s: the larger Village and Vitelline Masked-Weavers have red eyes, and Lesser Masked-Weaver has a black (not yellow) forehead."
0,Heuglin's Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe heuglini,https://ebird.org/species/heuwhe1,"A brownish wheatear with a rusty breast. Note the white eyebrow, dark mask, and pale throat. The tail is mostly black with a white base and rump, forming a thick “T” pattern that is conspicuous in flight. Found in short grassland, cultivated areas, and open savanna, often in rocky areas. Very similar to Red-breasted Wheater, but there is little overlap in range, and Heuglin’s is smaller and darker, with a duller pale throat. The song is a long, complex mix of many different components, sometimes given in a flight display."
0,Highland Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia obscura,https://ebird.org/species/higela2,"Medium-sized flycatcher with a small head and long tail. Found in forests and second growth. Largely olive above with a light gray throat and flanks, and a yellow center to the belly. Note two pale wingbars."

Mostly seen high in trees, as singles or pairs, where they can move quickly and slip away easily from view. Male is glossy black with bright red throat wattle and red legs (lacks whitish streaking on breast of the much larger Crested Guan). Female is barred brown and blackish overall. In spring, the male gives a piercing upslurred whistle, which it often alternates with an amazing crackling and crashing rattle in a gliding display flight."
0,Highland Rush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus centralis,https://ebird.org/species/hirwar2,"A nondescript long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Rusty-brown overall with blurry streaking on the breast. Found in wetland habitat, primarily reedbeds. Extremely secretive and skulking. Most often seen when it sits up to sing or gives a short display flight. Song starts with slow, hesitant, buzzy metallic notes that speed up, then ends with a trill made by beating the wings together at incredible speed. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed-warblers and swamp-warblers. Very similar to Little Rush Warbler, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Highland sings a much higher-pitched song."
0,Highland Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothocercus bonapartei,https://ebird.org/species/higtin1,"Rotund chickenlike bird, far more often heard than seen. Like a dove but body is even more circular and tail shorter. Most similar to Great Tinamou but generally found at higher elevations; also warmer rufous-brown below with small buffy spots on back and grayer head. Lives on the ground in montane forests. Shy and difficult to see; most often seen running away along a trail. Listen for series of repeated nasal call notes."
0,Hildebrandt's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis hildebrandti,https://ebird.org/species/hilsta1,"A beautiful starling of savanna country. The upperparts are iridescent, with a purple sheen on the head and green on most of the wing. Also note the orange underparts and eye. Found in moderately moist savanna and woodland, often in small flocks, sometimes with other species of starlings. Similar to Superb Starling, but doesn’t have a white chest band, underwing patch, or vent, and the eye is orange rather than whitish. Also similar to Shelley’s Starling, but slightly larger and paler overall, with a paler rufous belly and a more contrasting green wing. The common call is a raspy “cherrcherrcherr” that is incorporated into the rambling song."
0,Hill Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis whitei,https://ebird.org/species/hibfly1,"Medium-sized confusing flycatcher. Male is beautifully colored, with deep blue upperparts, orange throat and breast, and white belly. Note dark face and electric blue highlight on the forehead. Female is duller. Very similar to closely-related Large Blue Flycatcher: note marginally smaller bill without a noticeable hooked tip, less contrastingly pale throat, and darker legs. Male Hill Blue Flycatcher has more orange on the throat and a dark blue rump. Breeds in hilly and montane broadleaf thickets, often in areas with dense undergrowth; migratory birds winter at lower altitudes. Song mixes melodious warbling and whistling notes with harsh, rasping ones. Calls are a loud “chak” or “tak,” reminiscent of stones tapping."
0,Hill Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila torqueola,https://ebird.org/species/hilpar1,"A brightly-colored game bird with an intricate head pattern and a body shaped like a football. Brick-red on the crown serves to distinguish the male from the similar Rufous-throated Partridge, while male Hill Partridge also lacks orange on the throat. Female lacks the male's white chest band and brick-red crown and has less orange on the throat than Rufous-throated. Moves around in convoys through dense vegetation in mid- to high-altitude forests."
0,Hill Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba rupestris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpig1,"Very similar in appearance to the wild-type Rock Pigeon, this flocking species inhabits open valleys and gorges also visits towns and cities. More pale-headed than Rock Pigeon, but the key distinguishing trait is a broad white stripe across its dark tail which is visible both in flight and when perched; the wild-type Rock Pigeon has a dark-tipped gray tail with no white. Forages on the ground in large flocks; can be quite tame and accommodating towards human presence."
0,Hill Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpri2,"A large, fierce-eyed prinia with a long, oft-cocked tail. Breeding adults have a gray head, white throat and brow, brown upperparts, and pale, brown-washed underparts. Nonbreeding adults lack the gray but retain the white brow and throat. May be confused at a distance with Yellow-bellied Prinia, but is much larger, and has a more extensive brow and no bright yellow anywhere on the body. Usually found in open, scrubby habitats, including overgrown fields and forest edges. Loud, strident song consists of one high liquid-sounding note being repeated over and over."
0,Hill Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Hirundo domicola,https://ebird.org/species/pacswa3,"A small dark blue-black swallow with rufous-chestnut on its face and a short tail. Except for a black triangular eye-stripe extending to the bill, the entire forehead, chin, throat, and upper breast are rufous-chestnut, without any dark necklace like that of Barn Swallow, the main confusion species. Hill Swallow’s dark upperparts have a blue-green sheen that is only visible when seen up close, while the underparts are dingy white with ashy-gray on the flanks. Juveniles have duller chestnut on the face. Mainly inhabits open areas such as grasslands, reservoirs, and tea estates in the high hills above 500 meters of elevation; very rare at lower elevations. Often seen wheeling and looping in the air after insects, with a swift flight action reminiscent of a Barn Swallow with a shorter tail."
0,Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus pulcherrimus,https://ebird.org/species/bearos1,"A rather dark and heavily marked rosefinch. Male is dark rosy-pink below and dark, streaky brown above with a dark pink brow. Female is brown and streaky with underparts streaking extending from the throat (where the streaks are extremely fine) to the belly (where the streaks are heavier and longer). Females also have a faint pale brow, but it is weak and not always noticeable; note the far more contrasting brow of Chinese and Himalayan White-browed Rosefinches. Inhabits montane and hilly scrub, forest edges, and village outskirts. Gives twitters and trills. The extremely similar Chinese Beautiful Rosefinch gives sharper and more metallic call notes than the Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch."
0,Himalayan Bluetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Tarsiger rufilatus,https://ebird.org/species/himblu1,"Brightly-colored adult male is unmistakable in range: blazing sapphire blue with orange flanks and white throat and belly. Female is brown with a white throat, orange flanks, and pale blue rump and tail. Red-flanked Bluetail can be confusing where the two overlap in the latter’s migratory and winter range; note Himalayan’s brighter blue eyebrow and brighter, deeper blue upperparts in the male. Female is slightly more grayish than Red-flanked, but this identification can be much more difficult, and females may not be safely separable if not with male. Himalayan’s song is a simple, repeated “tcher-thcew-wee!”. Breeds in submontane forest up to the treeline; descends in the winter, often moving into edge habitats. A frequent sight along forest tracks."
0,Himalayan Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus leucogenys,https://ebird.org/species/whcbul2,"Sharp-looking bulbul with a spiffy mohawk. Note black face and throat, bright white cheek spot, and yellow vent. A species of foothill and montane forested areas; also found in brush, gardens, and towns. Tame and unafraid of people.

Calls include dry raspings, chups, and squeaks."
0,Himalayan Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo refectus,https://ebird.org/species/combuz9,"A large hawk with a confusing range and unclear identification criteria. Resident in the Himalayas and a breeder in adjacent areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A large “typical” buzzard, brown overall with blotchy patterning on the breast, dark upper “trousers,” and dark “elbows” and trailing edge on the underwing. Juvenile streakier below with a more finely barred tail and paler trailing edge. Compare with extremely similar Upland and Eastern Buzzards; note less eagle-like proportions than Upland, as well as marginally darker “trousers” and more prominent trailing edge than Eastern."
0,Himalayan Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Cuculus saturatus,https://ebird.org/species/himcuc1,"Visually indistinguishable from Oriental Cuckoo. Adult male is gray above with a black-and-white-barred belly and a dark gray tail; females usually look similar, but some (known as hepatic morph birds) have cinnamon-brown upperparts with black barring throughout. Intermediate in size between Common and Lesser Cuckoos; distinguished from both species by buffy (not white) under-tail feathers and from Lesser Cuckoos by yellow iris. Song is a series of five notes, with the leading note being sharper and more distinct than the four that follow; compare with Oriental Cuckoo’s series of mellow paired notes. Breeds in a wide range of different lowland and hill forests; also more open habitats outside of breeding season."
0,Himalayan Cutia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Cutia nipalensis,https://ebird.org/species/cutia1,"A beautiful, stocky inhabitant of high-elevation broadleaf and mixed forests. Looks like a babbler, but much more closely related to laughingthrushes. Male has a black mask, blue-gray crown, white throat, barred sides, and bright rufous back. Female is paler, with a brown face and a more yellowish back lined with black streaks. Forages at middle and upper levels, often in small groups, picking invertebrates from leaf clusters, ferns and orchids, and mossy crevices of trunks and branches. Listen for its loud song, an extended series of high-pitched, piercing “chee!” notes."
0,Himalayan Flameback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dinopium shorii,https://ebird.org/species/himfla1,"A large woodpecker with a brilliant orange back, a black stripe through the eye and cheek, and black on the back of the neck. Inhabits mature lowland forest. It looks for invertebrates in trees, meticulously working its way up from the base of the trunk. Not shy; often mixes with other species, especially babblers and laughingthrushes. Very similar to Common Flameback, but the Himalayan Flameback has a longer bill and the cheek stripe splits into two near the bill. The call is a tinny, nasal series of notes similar to those of other flamebacks."
0,Himalayan Monal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophophorus impejanus,https://ebird.org/species/himmon1,"Decked out in all the colors of the rainbow, the male is the image of iridescence; green crested head, red neck, green shoulders, blue back, orange tail, and black underparts. When displaying or flushed, flashes a bright white patch on the back. Female is nowhere near as brightly-colored, with a pale blue eye patch, white throat, and streaky brown body. Found in Himalayan hill forest, typically in areas with extensive rhododendron and bamboo-dominated understory."
0,Himalayan Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix nivicolum,https://ebird.org/species/himowl1,"A medium-sized brownish owl of montane forests, generally uncommon. Brownish overall with finely patterned underparts. Deep black eyes bracketed by bright white arcs impart a learned, severe expression. Asian counterpart to Europe's Tawny Owl. Calls loudly and slowly, a repeated pair of hoots."
0,Himalayan Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia crinigera,https://ebird.org/species/strpri2,"A rather dull-plumaged songbird of fields, grasslands, forest edges, and farmland, mostly at moderate and high elevations. Often sparsely distributed and difficult to find. Gray-brown above with a pale belly and blackish streaking on head and wings. Breeding males become black-billed and darker on the face, losing the pale eyebrow that is usually shown in other plumages. Typically found singly or in pairs, clambering about in grasses and shrubbery. Often sings from an exposed perch, giving a loud but dry, rolling series of notes, slower than the song of Striped Prinia. Visually very similar to Striped Prinia, but usually separated by range. In the area of overlap, female and non-breeding male Himalayan Prinias show weaker streaking on the back and a duller rufous panel in the wings. Breeding males are distinguished by their darker faces without an eye-stripe. Also similar to Burmese Prinia, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Himalayan Prinia is distinguished by having more streaking, especially along the sides of the breast."
0,Himalayan Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Ophrysia superciliosa,https://ebird.org/species/himqua1,"Extinct, last reported in 1876. Formerly west central Himalayas."
0,Himalayan Rubythroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/himrub1,"Shy inhabitant of thickets and dense grassy areas from subalpine scrub to above treeline. Male is gunmetal gray with a white brow, bright orange throat, and a black patch extending from the face down to the breast. Very similar to the closely related Chinese Rubythroat, which has a white moustachial stripe. Chinese Rubythroat female averages browner than female Himalayan, but is best identified by range; Chinese breeds in central and south-central China, while Himalayan breeds along the Himalayas, in Xinjiang, and in Central Asia. Female Himalayan has a weaker eyebrow than female Siberian Rubythroat, and is darker overall."
0,Himalayan Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx cruralis,https://ebird.org/species/whbsho4,"Tiny, stumpy bird of dense undergrowth. Male is dark slate-blue with broad white eyebrows that give him the appearance of a furious little old man. Female is warm pale brown all over. In areas of overlap with Chinese and Lesser Shortwings, look out for the all-dark lower belly, which is white in those species. Inhabits hill and montane forest, where it forages in dense undergrowth, frequently in proximity to streams. Song is composed of high thin whistles with short bursts of clicking chattering mixed in."
0,Himalayan Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus himalayensis,https://ebird.org/species/himsno,"A hulking game bird of rocky mountain slopes and cliffsides. Native to the Himalayas and adjacent mountain ranges, but has also been introduced in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada. Gray overall with patchy brown streaking on the breast and two dark brown lines running down the neck.

The westernmost ranging species in the genus and the only member throughout much of its range. Smaller than most other swifts in range except for House Swift, which is black overall with a sharp white rump and throat. Tends to travel in small to medium-sized flocks, often swooping low over bodies of water. Builds dark bowl-shaped nests in closely-clustered colonies under rocky overhangs, in caves, and in old buildings. Gives clicking calls and twitters, especially when near colonies."
0,Himalayan Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera salimalii,https://ebird.org/species/himthr1,"A mysterious and range-restricted thrush the color of rich caramel. Dark brown above with densely black-scaled underparts, white eye-ring, and uniform upperparts. Extremely similar to Sichuan and Alpine Thrushes; averages darker above, heavier-billed, and stockier-looking. Breeds in eastern Himalayan forests at around 3000-4000 meters; winters down to around 1450 meters. Gives a typical ringing, melodic thrush song."
0,Himalayan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dendrocopos himalayensis,https://ebird.org/species/himwoo1,"A relatively large woodpecker with a black back, a white patch on the shoulders, and white spots on the flight feathers. A distinctive black stripe runs around the ears to the base of the bill. The top of the male’s head is red, while the female’s is black. Usually solitary or in pairs, searching for invertebrates along the trunks of trees in oak, pine, and mixed forests. Calls include metallic grating notes, a single-noted “chuck,” and short, rapid rolls of drumming."
0,Hinde's Pied-Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides hindei,https://ebird.org/species/hipbab1,"A dark babbler with abundant scaly markings and red-orange eyes. The exact pattern and coloration are extremely variable. The underparts can be mostly black with white scaling, or mostly white with dark scaling. There is often rufous on the rump and undertail, and sometimes elsewhere. Found very locally at middle elevations in central Kenya, in thickets, remnant natural forest, and scrub dominated by exotic species. Almost always in small groups, which feed by hopping across the ground. Easily separated from other babblers in its range by the abundant and variable scaling. Usually located by the raspy babbling call, typically given by a whole group in chorus."
0,Hispaniolan Crossbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxia megaplaga,https://ebird.org/species/hiscro,"A gregarious species of montane pine forests. This species can be deceptively hard to find when not calling, despite its bright colors and tendency to travel in flocks of up to twenty. Note that the namesake crossed bill can be hard to see. Males are clothed in red and bear bright white wingbars. The dull yellow-olive female can be separated from other species by its bold white wingbars and structure: the bill is stout and the tail is short and notched. Call is loud “djit, djit.” Its song is a soft series of warblings and trills."
0,Hispaniolan Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Riccordia swainsonii,https://ebird.org/species/hiseme1,"An inhabitant of moist montane woodlands including coffee plantations. The long-tailed male is distinctively entirely iridescent green and the base of the bill is red. The female is metallic green above, dingy white below, and has a relatively long, forked tail. The Antillean Mango is shorter tailed (wings just about even with tail tip when perched) and has a distinctly down-curved bill. The Vervain Hummingbird is much smaller and shorter billed than the Hispaniolan Emerald. Most common vocalization is a sharp “tic,” most often given in a prolonged series at about five “tics” per second."
0,Hispaniolan Lizard-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus longirostris,https://ebird.org/species/hislic1,"An impressive long-tailed species of wooded habitats including shade coffee plantations. Typically found foraging in dense vegetation from understory to canopy; can be found sunning in the open at first light with its tail spread. Note this species long straight narrow bill, brilliant red eyering, gray chest, and buff-orange belly. The Bay-breasted Cuckoo is similarly shaped but is larger with a maroon chest and short curved bill. The Mangrove Cuckoo is smaller with a smaller curved bill and a black mask. Secretive, but not shy, this species is often first detected by its voice: a long, rapid, ratcheting “keh-keh-keh…” Also gives a low “craaa” and a sharp “chek.”"
0,Hispaniolan Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/graori1,"A sleek forest bird that sometimes ventures into gardens and parks in search of flowers and fruit; prefers areas with palms. The adult is distinctive—clothed in black except for patches of yellow on lower belly, shoulders, and rump. No similar species occur within its range. Immatures are muddled yellow, orange, and olive, developing adult plumage over the course of a year. This plumage resembles that of female and young Baltimore Orioles, a scarce migrant and winter visitor to Hispaniola. Similarly attired Baltimore Orioles can be distinguished by their orange underparts and white wingbars. The song is a rapid jumble of squeaky and metallic notes. Calls include a buzzy “jrrrt” and a metallic “zhwee.”"
0,Hispaniolan Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacara chloropterus,https://ebird.org/species/hispar,"A sleek, medium-large, gregarious species of woodlands that sometimes ventures into agricultural and urban areas. Its overall green plumage, long, pointed tail, and stout bill eliminate all other species in range. In overflight, it often appears green with a red slash on each forewing. Most common call is a series of squeaks that takes on a twittering quality when given by an excited flock."
0,Hispaniolan Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus hispaniolensis,https://ebird.org/species/hispew1,"A small drab inhabitant of woodlands including orchards and coffee plantations; typically “flycatches” from a low perch and returns to the same perch. This species is perhaps most notable in its lack of field marks, including lack of wingbars and facial markings. The Stolid Flycatcher is much larger and has wingbars and the Greater Antillean Elaenia has bold wingbars and a dull eyering. Rather unvocal for a pewee; most common call is a repeated mellow “pip”."
0,Hispaniolan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes striatus,https://ebird.org/species/hiswoo1,"A noisy and gregarious woodpecker that inhabits most wooded habitats.

0,Hodgson's Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/hodfro1,"Cryptic, uncommon nightbird of evergreen and mixed foothill and montane forests (900-2000 meters). Both sexes have dappled lichen-like plumage, the male grayish, female rusty brown. Silent birds are best distinguished from other small frogmouths by range, habitat, elevation, and bird’s comparatively small size. Song a long, haunting whistle, given repeatedly in series."
0,Hodgson's Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Phoenicurus hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/hodred1,"Male very similar in appearance to Daurian Redstart; note more restricted silver on the forehead and less distinct wing panel. Female’s lack of a white wing patch distinguishes her from female Daurian, and she averages paler than female Black Redstart, with a brighter eye-ring. Blue-fronted Redstart female can be similar; Hodgson’s female is colder-toned with a single dark stripe down the tail instead of Blue-fronted’s inverted “T.” Hodgson’s breeds in hilly and montane open forests and forest edge; descends in the winter, favoring scrubby edge."
0,Hodgson's Treecreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Certhiidae,Certhia hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/eurtre3,"Beer-bellied tree-climber with intricately patterned brown upperparts, white underparts, and a decurved bill. Combination of rusty rump, unstriped brown tail, and clean underparts distinguish this species from other similar treecreepers in its range. All but identical to Eurasian Treecreeper, but no range overlap; confined to the Himalayas and Central China. Favors conifers but can also be found in mixed and broadleaf forests. Song begins with a few high thin notes and devolves into a buzzy twitter."
0,Hoffmann's Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes hoffmannii,https://ebird.org/species/hofwoo1,"Medium-sized woodpecker with bold black-and-white barring on back and a cream-colored belly. A patch of yellow on the lower belly can be difficult to see. Male has red crown and yellow nape. Female lacks red crown. Distinctive in range, but hybridizes with Red-crowned Woodpecker; hybrids best left unidentified. Found in open woodland, edges, and gardens."
0,Hoffmanns's Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Dendrocolaptes hoffmannsi,https://ebird.org/species/hofwoo2,"Large woodcreeper with a strong black bill. Dark chestnut-brown overall. Note the very fine bars on the head and underparts and the cinnamon crown. Found in the interior of humid forest and second growth, sometimes venturing to the forest edges, and regularly attending army-ant swarms. The song is a rolling series of “wutwutwut…” notes like the song of the closely-related Black-banded Woodcreeper, but the two probably don’t overlap in range. The similar Amazonian Barred-Woodcreeper has a dark red-brown bill."
0,Holub's Golden-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus xanthops,https://ebird.org/species/hogwea1,"Large weaver with a heavy black bill and pale eyes. Juveniles dull, with brown eyes; they can be identified by their overall structure and tendency to associate with more distinctive adults. Found in savanna, woodland, scrub, and cultivation.

0,Icterine Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Hippolais icterina,https://ebird.org/species/ictwar1,"Quite large warbler, olive-green above and yellow below. Distinctive features include longish, daggerlike bill, long primary projection in the wings, and square tail. Told from similar Melodious Warbler by usually conspicuous pale wing panel and gray (not brown) legs. Usually difficult to see when singing except during song flights, when long wings are apparent. Found in tall forest with oaks and birch, mixed forest, gardens, and parks. Song is fast, loud, and melodious with lots of mimicry."
0,Iiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Drepanis coccinea,https://ebird.org/species/iiwi,"A bright red Hawaiian honeycreeper of high elevation native forests on Kauai, Maui, and Hawaii Island. Very rare on Oahu and Molokai. The brilliant crimson color and long, curved salmon-colored bill are diagnostic. Juveniles are mottled green, yellow, and orange. Very active and boisterous in the understory and forest canopy. Aggressively chases other birds from flowering trees. Vocalizations include a complex array of gurgles, chuckles, and reedy notes, more varied, lower pitched, and louder than those of the Apapane."
0,Ijima's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus ijimae,https://ebird.org/species/ijlwar1,"An uncommon migrant songbird through Taiwan, rarely encountered anywhere away from breeding grounds on Izu and Tokara Islands, Japan. Olive above and whitish below; best distinguished from similar species by narrow bill with yellowish lower mandible, brownish-pink legs, and weak head pattern. Prefers mature coastal broadleaf forests but uses bamboo patches and conifers during migration as well. Smaller than Eastern Crowned Leaf Warbler, with thinner bill and no crown stripe. Song consists of a series of trills; calls, given often, include a descending “twee” or quiet “pee.”"
0,Imeri Warbling-Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Hypocnemis flavescens,https://ebird.org/species/imewaa1,"Small antbird. Males are streaked black above, with a yellow-tinged throat and rusty flanks. Females are similar but with brownish streaks above. Inhabits the understory of both non-flooded and seasonally flooded forests, and regularly attends army-ant swarms. The song is a descending series of whistles that ends with a harsh note: “tew, tew-tzew-tzew-tur paw, paw.” The similar Guianan Warbling-Antbird has a white throat and is more streaked on the breast; the song also has a different pace. The Peruvian Warbling-Antbird has more black on the throat and breast and is less yellow below."
0,Imperial Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Amazona imperialis,https://ebird.org/species/imppar1,"A rather large, dark, and stout resident of wet upland forest. Note iridescent purple underparts, vivid green upperparts, and hefty black bill. The Red-necked Parrot, the only other native species within its range, can be readily separated from the Imperial Parrot by its largely green plumage and the red (not purple) patch on its throat. Most common call is a yelping ""weep"", also gives a loud, scratchy “eee-er.”"
0,Imperial Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago imperialis,https://ebird.org/species/impsni1,"Hulking snipe of high-elevation elfin forest in the Andes. Large with a thick, drooping bill. Upperparts are black with bold cinnamon scaling; underparts are buff with black scaling, becoming paler on belly. It is larger, bulkier, and more brightly-colored than other high-Andean snipe. Shy and rarely seen; most likely encountered in dim, misty conditions when it may venture out onto a quiet trail. At display sites, birds fly overhead giving low, grating calls followed by a mechanical humming sound."
0,Inaccessible Island Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Nesospiza acunhae,https://ebird.org/species/nigfin1,"A highly variable finch with three distinct forms in the process of diversifying. The massive large-billed form is known as “Dunn’s Finch”; the two smaller forms with petite bills are a drab olive lowland form (Lowland Finch) and a bright yellow highland form (Highland Finch). Females of all forms are smaller, duller, and more streaked than males. Endemic to Inaccessible Island, where it is the only finch. Lowland form prefers grassy coast and cliffs, highland form prefers the plateau, and Dunn’s form prefers taller fruit-bearing woodland. In all forms, male sings a 3-note “whit-it-teeu” and the female whistles; Dunn’s form sounds deeper and slower than the others."
0,Inaccessible Island Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Atlantisia rogersi,https://ebird.org/species/inirai1,"A tiny, mouse-like flightless rail restricted to Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha group. The sooty adult has a brown back, a white-barred belly and flanks, and a reddish eye. Duller juvenile is paler and lacks barring. Prefers dense cover like tussock and thickets. Vocal, giving a strident trill to proclaim its territory, as well as a short “tchick” and other hard notes."
0,Inagua Woodstar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Nesophlox lyrura,https://ebird.org/species/inawoo2,"A small, long-tailed hummingbird of wooded and scrubby habitats including gardens; most often found feeding on flowers or at hummingbird feeders.

0,Inambari Gnatcatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Polioptila attenboroughi,https://ebird.org/species/inagna1,"Recently described, inconspicuous and rarely seen bird of rainforest canopy. Small and slender with a long tail; mostly dark gray with a broken white eyering, white belly, and white outer tail feathers. Inhabits canopy of tall forest, especially in regions with sandy soils. Usually seen with mixed-species flocks as it forages actively in outer foliage, sallying for insects and gleaning from leaves, moving long tail from side to side like other gnatcatchers. Thin and indistinct call notes are easily overlooked among calls of other species in flocks, but distinctive shape, active behavior, and long tail with extensive white should clinch identification. Extremely similar to other gnatcatchers of the Guianan Gnatcatcher complex, but no overlap in range. Distinguished from Tropical Gnatcatcher by uniform gray body plumage and lack of a black cap, and from Tooth-billed Wren by slimmer shape and smaller size, lacking any black barring in the plumage."
0,Inambari Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Lepidocolaptes fatimalimae,https://ebird.org/species/inawoo1,"Fairly small woodcreeper with a thin, slightly downcurved bill. Extensive streaking on the undersides but almost no streaking on the head or back; when viewed from the back, appears very plain. Olive-brown back and head, often noticeably slightly greener than the rest of the bird. Found mostly in secondary forest, with tall trees and a dense understory. Its song is a descending series of fast whistles, recalling the longer song of White-browed Antbird, or for some, the call of Downy Woodpecker."
0,Inca Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columbina inca,https://ebird.org/species/incdov,"Essentially a ground dove with a long tail. Pale sandy color with scaly pattern covering entire body, unlike Common Ground Dove. Look for obvious white outer tail feathers and rufous wings in flight. Fairly common from the southwestern U.S. to far western Panama. Found in pairs or small groups in neighborhoods, parks, and scrubby desert habitats. Listen for repeated soft whistled song, sounding like “no hope.” Whirring wingbeats sound almost like a rattlesnake when it takes off."
0,Inca Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Leptopogon taczanowskii,https://ebird.org/species/incfly1,"Fairly small flycatcher that perches upright in the mid-story of montane forest and cloud forest. Subtly colorful, with a diffuse gray facial pattern. Look for the warm buffy orange wash on the breast and faint orange wingbars. Warmer orange coloration and lack of a gray crown or strong facial pattern help distinguish it from the similar Slaty-capped Flycatcher, which it replaces at higher elevations. Forages singly or in pairs, occasionally joining mixed-species flocks; has the unusual habit of quickly raising one wing at a time behind its back."
0,Inca Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larosterna inca,https://ebird.org/species/incter1,"Beautiful and distinctive dark tern of the Humboldt Current. Found along rocky coasts and at harbors and piers where it is often confiding; less often found at sandy beaches and river mouths. Feeds over coastal and inshore waters, dipping to pick food from near surface rather than plunge-diving like typical terns. All plumages dark overall with narrow white trailing edge to wings. Adult has red bill and legs, yellow gape patch, and curling ‘Salvador Dali’ whisker. 1st-year browner overall with dark bill and legs, soon develops vestige of white whisker."

0,Inland Thornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Acanthiza apicalis,https://ebird.org/species/inltho1,"Small bird with thin pointed bill. Upperparts gray-brown, underparts off-white, with dark streaking on throat and breast, reddish-brown rump, white flecking on forecrown, and dark red eye. Often cocks tail upright. Similar Brown Thornbill has brown rather than gray-brown upperparts. Chestnut-rumped and Buff-rumped thornbills both have pale eyes, unstreaked chest, and mostly black tails. Inhabits dry woodland and scrubland, also in wetter habitats in southwestern edges of its range."
0,Intermediate Egret,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardea intermedia,https://ebird.org/species/integr,"A stocky egret that is larger than Cattle and Little Egrets, but smaller than the Great Egret. Often confusing and difficult to identify, this bird is truly intermediate between potential confusion species. Things to look for include a yellow bill that is shorter than Great Egret but longer than Cattle Egret, a relatively rounded head, and shorter legs than Great Egret, approaching Cattle Egret. In Asian populations the bill becomes black during the breeding season; these birds can be distinguished from Little Egret by their completely black feet and shorter bills. Like most egret species, associates with all types of water bodies including wet fields and usually flocks with other egrets."
0,Invisible Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus wallacii,https://ebird.org/species/invrai1,"A huge, distinctive all-dark flightless forest rail with a powerful red bill and red legs. Restricted to the island of Halmahera in the North Moluccas, where it occurs in swampy areas within forest, especially sago swamps. Very shy, roaming the forest floor singly or in pairs. Calls include deep drumming noises, and a racket of loud “WAK-WAK-WAK” notes repeated in an agitated-sounding series. Also gives quieter clucking notes."
0,Iphis Monarch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Pomarea iphis,https://ebird.org/species/iphmon2,"A glossy bluish-black flycatcher with a variable white belly and undertail. Female brown above, pale below, with a pale lower bill. Found in wooded areas. Calls include a quiet low whistle and rasping chip notes."
0,Iquitos Gnatcatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Polioptila clementsi,https://ebird.org/species/iqugna1,"Rare bird known only from the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve in the lowlands of northeastern Peru. Like other gnatcatchers, it is mainly gray and white; tail is black with white outer feathers. Distinguished from female Tropical Gnatcatcher by gray breast and broken white eye-ring. Inhabits canopy of forests in areas with sandy soil. Typical song is three “sip” notes followed by a rapid trill."
0,Iraq Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Argya altirostris,https://ebird.org/species/irabab1,"Small babbler with a long tail and short wings, typical of other babblers. Warm buff overall with a pale throat and a lightly streaked back and crown. Moves around in reedbeds in noisy flocks. Vocalizations include a high-pitched ""pi-pi-pi-pi-pi…"" and explosive ""pit! pit!"""
0,Iringa Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia lowei,https://ebird.org/species/iriaka1,"A rather small, demure understory denizen resembling a cross between a robin and a flycatcher. Mostly dull brown with a buffy throat and a short eyebrow. Juvenile is more mottled. A highly local bird found singly and in pairs in dry and wet primary and secondary montane forest in a narrow range along the Udzungwa and Livingstone mountains escarpment between 1350 and 2500 meters of elevation. Sits for long periods, sallying to catch insect prey, or forages on the ground, often in the company of ants and other ant-following birds. Sings a variable medley of quavering high-pitched notes, “tseet-teet-tsereet-teeet-tsureet,” that is sweet without being tuneful. Calls include an invariable piping “wheet” uttered once a second. Alarm call is a grating “drrrzzt, drrrt, drrrt.” May be mistaken for a flycatcher, but its furtive nature and preference for thick understory are unique within its range."
0,Iriomote Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Sittiparus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/vartit2,"Reddish-brown songbird with a black crown and throat and olive-gray wings. Resident in broadleaf evergreen forests, especially in higher elevations, but poorly known. Endemic to Iriomote and Ishigaki Islands, in the southern Ryukyu Islands. Formerly considered conspecific with Varied Tit, and plumage intermediate between Varied Tit and Owston’s Tit, but neither has Iriomote’s olive wash on wings. Song resembles Japanese Tit, and nasal call recalls Varied Tit but drier."
0,Iris Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Saudareos iris,https://ebird.org/species/irilor1,"A small green parrot with a red forehead, an orange bill, a dark purple eye patch and crown, and a yellow collar. Juveniles show a brown bill. Found in small groups, mainly in the foothills, in forest and a variety of wooded areas. Confined to Wetar and Timor, where it overlaps with the larger and longer-tailed Marigold and Olive-headed Lorikeets.

0,Isabela Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus isabellae,https://ebird.org/species/isaori1,"A medium-sized bird of lowland forest, including secondary habitats and bamboo in northern Luzon. Yellow underparts blend into olive upperparts. Bill fairly long and silver. Forages for fruit and insects, sometimes in mixed-species flocks. Similar to White-lored Oriole, but slightly larger, with a silver rather than red bill and no white spot in front of the eye. Song consists of a medium-pitched, upslurred whistle, “hoowit!”."
0,Isabelline Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius isabellinus,https://ebird.org/species/isashr1,"Small pale sandy-colored shrike. Male is gray-brown above with a black mask and unmarked pale underparts that contrast with a bright cinnamon tail. Female is similar, but with a paler mask, grayer upperparts, and faint barring on the sides. Both sexes have pale underparts. Red-tailed Shrike looks similar, but male Red-tailed Shrikes have a contrasting warm brownish crown and females average whiter on the underparts. Female Red-backed Shrikes also have a warmer brown back and more prominent scaling patterns on a white breast and belly than Isabelline Shrikes. Typically found in dry brushy areas."
0,Isabelline Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe isabellina,https://ebird.org/species/isawhe1,"A large pale wheatear. Gray-brown above with warm orangish tones on white underparts and a pale white eyebrow. Tail is predominantly black with white edges and it contrasts sharply with its snow-white rump. Somewhat similar in coloration to a toned-down female Northern Wheatear, but visibly larger, shorter-tailed, and longer-billed (all of which are accentuated by the typically tall, erect posture). Inhabits flat, open areas, often at middle to high elevations. Remarkable song has a tumbling quality that includes long ringing whistles, chattering, and imitations of other sounds in the surrounding environment. Calls include shorter whistles and hard “chak’s,” like rocks being struck together."
0,Island Imperial-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula pistrinaria,https://ebird.org/species/isipig1,"A large, long-necked pigeon, more uniformly gray than other imperial-pigeons in the region. Overall very pale, with a dark blue tail, a pinkish wash to throat and chest, and a gray back and wings. Birds in the Admiralty Islands have green wings and back. Relatively coastal, preferring smaller islands. Perches conspicuously in the open. Similar to Pacific Imperial-Pigeon, but overall paler. Birds on the Admiralty Islands differ from juvenile Red-knobbed Imperial-Pigeon in their gray, not cinnamon, belly and underside. Normally heard giving a high-pitched “ahu ahu ahu ahu” call, falling in pitch and volume."
0,Island Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus poliocephalus,https://ebird.org/species/islwar1,"A small warbler with a pale eyebrow, a dull greenish upperside, a white throat, and yellowish underparts. Sometimes shows a faint central crown stripe, and sometimes an indistinct wingbar. Widespread with small variations, perhaps indicating multiple cryptic species. Singles, pairs, or groups inhabit lowland and hill forest, often accompanying mixed-species flocks. Differs from Arctic, Japanese, and Kamchatka Leaf Warblers in being smaller, yellower underneath, and darker above, and in sometimes showing a central crown stripe. Sings a very variable high-pitched warble mixed with twittering phrases."
0,Island Scrub-Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma insularis,https://ebird.org/species/issjay,"The largest and darkest scrub-jay, identifiable solely based on range: found exclusively on Santa Cruz Island off southern California. Similar to California Scrub-Jay but larger, with darker back and darker mask. Inhabits scrubby woodland habitat, often on or near the ground. Typically found in small family groups."
0,Island Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala phaionota,https://ebird.org/species/islwhi2,"A rather drab, medium-sized bird of wooded habitats on small islands. Gray head, white throat, brown back and very pale brown underparts with slightly darker brown smudges on the sides of the chest. Very similar to Brown-backed Whistler but does not co-occur.

0,Isthmian Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cantorchilus elutus,https://ebird.org/species/istwre1,"Small, skulking wren of foothills and lowlands in southwestern Costa Rica south into Panama. Found in forest edges, second-growth thickets, and brushy fields with cane grass. Heard more often than seen: song relatively short with bright phrases usually repeated a few times in quick succession. Note the bold white eyebrow, whitish breast, rich buffy flanks, and bright rusty tail barred black. Formerly known as Plain Wren."
0,Italian Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer italiae,https://ebird.org/species/itaspa1,"Similar to House and Spanish Sparrows. Males have a brown crown and white cheeks like Spanish Sparrow, but a restricted black throat and upper breast like House Sparrow. Females essentially inseparable from the other two species and voice also identical. Habitat preferences similar to House Sparrow; rarely strays far from urban areas. An evolutionary intermediate between House and Spanish Sparrow following historical gene flow."
0,Itatiaia Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Asthenes moreirae,https://ebird.org/species/itaspi1,"Small, plain, long-billed and long-tailed spinetail with a restricted range. Found in bamboo thickets and clearings in montane forests with grass and shrubs where it forages in the understory. Note the rufous chin contrasting with a dull-brown body. The song is a high-pitched ascending and descending trill."
0,Ituri Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis ituriensis,https://ebird.org/species/itubat1,"A very small and striking gray, white, and black flycatcher-like bird with a very dark crown, a yellow eye, white wingbars, and a white spot above the bill base. Sexes similar. Juvenile has neck and wing washed buffy. Pairs are rare and localized residents in the middle levels and the canopy of secondary and primary lowland forest, below 1300 meters of elevation. The larger Rwenzori Batis has a broader breast band than Ituri Batis and tends to occur in montane forest above 1400 meters."
0,Ivory Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Pagophila eburnea,https://ebird.org/species/ivogul,"A spectacular and highly sought-after Arctic gull. Unmistakable in all plumages. Adults are entirely gleaming white with black legs and a bluish-green bill with an orange tip. Immatures have a dark face and variable black spotting on the wings and tail. Stocky and short-legged, suggesting an odd white pigeon as much as a typical gull. Almost always restricted to icy areas in the High Arctic, very rarely wandering further south in the winter. Can be seen singly or in loose groups, especially when feeding at a seal carcass. Typically very confiding."
0,Izu Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus celaenops,https://ebird.org/species/izuthr1,"Handsome songbird found only on Izu, Tokara, and a few other islands off the coast of Japan, where fairly common, most abundant in broadleaf evergreen forests. Male orange-brown above, rich orange below, with black hood, yellow bill, and yellow eyering. Female lacks male’s hood and intense colors; very similar to female and young Brown-headed Thrush but has extensive black spotting on the undertail coverts. Song recalls Japanese Robin’s."
0,Jabiru,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Jabiru mycteria,https://ebird.org/species/jabiru,"Huge, massive-billed, and unmistakable stork of tropical lowlands. Found in marshes and flooded fields, but nests high in large trees. Sometimes seen feeding in wetlands in loose association with other wading birds, which are all much smaller. Flies strongly and often high overhead, sometimes even soaring like a vulture. Plumage is wholly white (no black in wings in flight) but the naked head and neck are black, with a broad red band at base of the neck."
0,Jack Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Lymnocryptes minimus,https://ebird.org/species/jacsni,"A small snipe, with stripy and cryptic plumage. Similar in appearance to Common Snipe, but note shorter bill, dark crown without pale stripe down middle, and wide golden stripes or ""braces"" down the back. Found in fresh and brackish marshes, but rarely seen unless flushed, when usually flies up silently from almost underfoot and drops back down not too far away. Single birds feed quietly by probing in mud, usually near cover; walks with distinctive, near-constant bobbing motion."
0,Jackal Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo rufofuscus,https://ebird.org/species/jacbuz1,"A large, heavy buzzard with striking black, chestnut, and white patterning that is especially evident in flight. Occupies a wide range of open habitats, where it sits on poles, fences, and rocks hunting for small and large vertebrates. The harsh scolding “kaaaa-haa-haa” call is distinctive and similar to that of a jackal. A rare pale-chested morph can resemble Augur Buzzard, but Jackal Buzzard is always differentiated by the dark (not pale) forward part of the underwing. The brown-and-rufous juvenile Jackal Buzzard is similar to other buzzards, but it is larger, with broad wings and a hefty head."
0,Jackson's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Tockus jacksoni,https://ebird.org/species/jachor1,"A medium-sized black-and-white hornbill. Males have a mostly red bill with a small yellow or white tip; females have an all-black bill. Both sexes show white spotting across the wing. Found locally in dry savanna, usually in pairs or small groups. Similar to Von der Decken’s and Northern Red-billed Hornbills, but separated from the former by the white-spotted wing and from the latter by the yellow-tipped (male) or all-black (female) bill. The call is a series of low clucks."
0,Jackson's Widowbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Euplectes jacksoni,https://ebird.org/species/jacwid1,"A medium-sized dark widowbird. Breeding males are unmistakable, with a long downcurved tail and rufous shoulders. Non-breeding males lose their long tail and become streaky and brown, but keep the shoulder pattern. Females are brown and streaky year-round. Breeds in montane grassland, but sometimes found in cultivation and other open habitats. Otherwise usually in flocks, especially when not breeding. Males give an odd display in which they jump straight into the air. Females could be confused with many other species, but even during the non-breeding season are usually associated with males, which can be identified by their shoulder pattern. Non-breeding males could be confused with non-breeding male Fan-tailed Widowbird, but have a more restricted and less orange shoulder patch. The main vocalization is a dry “zrit.”"
0,Jacky-winter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Microeca fascinans,https://ebird.org/species/jacwin1,"Small Australian robin, gray-brown above and pale below; often swings tail side to side when perched. Dark tail with prominent white outer tail feathers, absent in similar Kimberley subspecies of Lemon-bellied Flycatcher. Female Hooded Robin similar but with darker wing showing pale panels. Female Golden Whistler much larger and plumper, with a thick bill and yellow lower belly. Usually in pairs in open woodlands, where it perches prominently, often on stumps and posts. Hunts by plucking prey from the ground, in typical Australian robin style."
0,Jalca Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus frankeae,https://ebird.org/species/miltap1,"Long known to ornithologists as something different (and informally called “Millpo Tapaculo”), this bird was finally described as a new species in 2020. It inhabits grassy, rock-strewn areas above tree line at high elevations in the eastern Andes of central Peru. Plumage is mainly gray with tan rear parts that are faintly barred, and it sometimes shows a faint, whitish eyebrow; female is browner than male. Similar in appearance to several other tapaculos, and best identified by range and voice. Song, often given from atop a rock, is a seemingly endless series of raspy chip notes."
0,Jamaican Becard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Pachyramphus niger,https://ebird.org/species/jambec1,"A small but stout woodland species often found hovering beneath the canopy while snapping up insects or fruit. Note the male’s all blackish plumage. The only similar bird in its range is the Jamaican Blackbird, but the Jamaican Blackbird has a slimmer bill and it is typically found probing in vegetation rather than flycatching like the becard. Females and immatures are dark brown above and pale below, often with buff on throat. Females and immatures could be mistaken for Stolid, Sad, or Rufous-tailed Flycatchers, however, these flycatchers have grayish (not buff) throats and yellowish on the belly that female and immature becards lack. Song is a staccato squeaky twitter typically followed by a drawn out “tweeeee.” Call is a sharp but squeaky “peep.”"
0,Jamaican Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Nesopsar nigerrimus,https://ebird.org/species/jambla1,"A species of higher elevation woodlands where it is often found feeding high in the trees, even near the forest canopy, rather unlike other blackbird species. Indeed, any blackbird found foraging within Jamaica’s upper elevation forests is very likely this species. Its plumage is all black, its tail is short, and the bill is moderately long and slim. The similar Shiny Cowbird has a shorter, stouter bill and a longer tail. The Greater Antillean Grackle is larger, longer-tailed, and has a pale (not dark) eye. The song is a wheezy “whee-whee-oooo” and variations thereof; common call is emphatic, squeaky “wheet.”"
0,Jamaican Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus jamaicensis,https://ebird.org/species/jamcro1,"An all black and somewhat large species that prefers wet forests but also occurs in open woodlands. Often found perched high on bare branches of trees or working epiphyte clumps and tree nooks in search of large insects and small lizards. All species in its range that are entirely black are considerably smaller than the Jamaican Crow. Calls include emphatic harsh “raaaa,” given singly or in series, a more leisurely “craaa-aa” and variations thereof, and somewhat of a musical burbling."
0,Jamaican Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis cotta,https://ebird.org/species/jamela1,"A rather small woodland flycatcher that is easily overlooked. It is the only flycatcher in its range with a short white eyebrow and no wingbars. Also note the crisp white crescent below its eye and small black bill. Often detected by its song, which consists of several rapid, loud, slightly squeaky, descending notes (typically five): “Tsi-Tsi-Tsi-Tsi-Tsa”. It is most often found feeding high within the forest."
0,Jamaican Euphonia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Euphonia jamaica,https://ebird.org/species/jameup1,"A very small and active inhabitant of most wooded habitats and gardens where it forages mostly on fruits and flowers. Note this species’ short, stubby bill, and mostly gray head and underparts. The Orangequit is somewhat similar but is readily distinguished by its longer and slightly curved bill. Additionally, male Orangequits are darker gray and have an orange throat, while female Orangequits have brown upperparts. Song is rapid-fire jumble of squeaks, whistles, and buzzes. The call note is a sharp “tseet.” Jamaican Euphonias also give a scratchy, squeaky “bao,” which is given singly, in series, or interjected into songs."
0,Jamaican Lizard-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus vetula,https://ebird.org/species/jamlic1,"An impressive long-tailed bird of moist mid-elevation woodlands including secondary growth, where it feeds in the understory by peeking and probing into vegetation in pursuit of insects and lizards. Generally solitary and secretive, but not shy. Note this species’ long, straight, narrow bill and buff underparts. The Chestnut-bellied Cuckoo is similar in overall shape, but it is somewhat larger with a chestnut belly and a grayish chest; also note its bill is much shorter and somewhat curved compared to Jamaican Lizard-Cuckoo. The passingly similar Mangrove Cuckoo is somewhat smaller, shorter billed, lacks an eyering, and has a black mask. Jamaican Lizard-Cuckoos are often first detected by voice: a rapid-fire, ratcheting “k-k-k-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh…” that grows slower and louder as it progresses; usually given at a uniform pitch."
0,Jamaican Mango,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Anthracothorax mango,https://ebird.org/species/jamman1,"A large dark hummingbird of forest edges, plantations, and gardens. Its black underparts, iridescent red cheeks, and red-purple tail are unique within its range. Note that females and immatures of this species are not as vivid as males. Call is a sharp “tsic,” given individually or in a series."
0,Jamaican Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus leucopteryx,https://ebird.org/species/jamori1,"A fruit-loving inhabitant of woodlands and gardens. Adult is yellow (often tinged green or orange), sports a black beard, and has very large white wing patches covering half of the otherwise black wing. Immatures look similar, but they have two broad white wingbars instead of a white patch. Immature male Orchard Oriole looks somewhat similar, but it is smaller and lacks the bold white wing markings seen on Jamaican Orioles. Songs include a rapid series of rich, whistled, and mostly down-slurred phrases and “cheat-you, cheat-you, cheat-you, cheat-you, cheat.”"
0,Jamaican Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Asio grammicus,https://ebird.org/species/jamowl1,"A somewhat large nocturnal inhabitant of wooded areas including gardens and parks; roosts in tree cavities or dense foliage during the day. The Barn Owl is of similar size, but it is much paler and lacks the Jamaican Owl’s prominent ear tufts. Vocalizations include a low, gruff “wa-waaa-o” and a crescendo/decrescendo “whoa.”"
0,Jamaican Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus pallidus,https://ebird.org/species/jampew1,"A small, plain woodland species often found flycatching from exposed perches at middle levels in the forest; often flicks tail once upon landing. Note that this species has relatively inconspicuous wingbars and no eyering. The similar Eastern Wood-Pewee has distinctly longer primaries (assessed by looking at how far the primaries extend beyond tertials), whitish wingbars, and rarely flicks its tail upon landing. The Greater Antillean Elaenia has bold white wingbars and an entirely dark bill unlike the Jamaican Pewee. Vocalizations include plaintive “wee-wee,” with the second note louder and both notes upslurred, a similarly plaintive ‘uh-weee-oo” with the middle portion upslurred, and a slightly rough, whistled “weeah.”"
0,Jamaican Spindalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Spindalidae,Spindalis nigricephala,https://ebird.org/species/jamspi,"A somewhat small woodland and scrubland bird that moves rather deliberately as it feeds on fruits and flowers and the occasional insect. Brilliant male is a swirl of yellows, oranges, and reds with black-and-white striped head; unlike any other Jamaican bird. Female has a similar pattern but drab colors. Call is a thin high-pitched “tsee” given singularly or in a rapid series."
0,Jamaican Tody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Todidae,Todus todus,https://ebird.org/species/jamtod1,"A small, gemlike, woodland species usually found in pairs. Its rather large head, long bill, and short tail create a unique profile. Also note the shimmering green upperparts and red throat. No similar species occur within its range. It usually hunts from low-to-middle level perches, sitting nearly still before leaping upwards to snatch prey. Vocalizations include a scratchy “zheh,” given in series at a rate of about one per second and a brief rapid rattle."
0,Jamaican Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo modestus,https://ebird.org/species/jamvir1,"A small inhabitant of thickets in woodlands and scrublands where it feeds by actively searching for insects within tangles; avoids mangroves and well-manicured woodlands that lack dense undergrowth. The Greater Antillean Elaenia shares this species’ wingbars and overall dull coloration, but the elaenia has prominent whitish markings around the eye and is usually found perched upright or flycatching. The Jamaican Vireo’s song includes a “chi-wee, chi-wee, chi-wee, chi-wee, you,” a “chi-wuh, chi-wuh, chi-wuh, zha,” and a “wee-wee-zhrr.” Calls include “jip,” given singly or in a series, and a harsh upslurred “zhweee.”"
0,Jamaican Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes radiolatus,https://ebird.org/species/jamwoo1,"A striking medium-sized species of wooded habitats. The white face framed by the red of its nape and crown and its finely barred black-and-white back is distinctive; resembles no other species in its range. Sometimes first detected by its determined excavation of rotting wood. Vocalizations include an emphatic, slightly rough “urp,” and a burry “urr-urr-urr-urr” given as a rapid rolling burst."
0,Jambandu Indigobird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Vidua raricola,https://ebird.org/species/jamind1,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Zebra Waxbills. Breeding males are glossy black with green or blue iridescence and a pale brownish panel in the wings. Females and non-breeding males are streaky and brown on the back and pale below, with a bold facial pattern. The bill is whitish and the legs very pale purplish. A scarce and poorly known species. Found in wetlands, moist grasslands, and cultivation. Given current knowledge, can only be confidently identified by vocalizations. Imitates the “svet” calls of its host, Zebra Waxbill, and often mixes them into a scratchy jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Jambu Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus jambu,https://ebird.org/species/jafdov1,"The plum-red face and pink “blush” on the white chest of the cartoonish-looking male are unique. Plainer female and juvenile can be difficult to separate from female Black-naped Fruit Dove; look out for Jambu’s bright white eye-ring and orange bill. Generally uncommon and nomadic; roams widely across lowland and foothill forests, where it seeks out fruiting trees. Forages quietly in the canopy, typically singly or in pairs."
0,James's Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicoparrus jamesi,https://ebird.org/species/jamfla1,"Rather local; found at salt lakes and bogs in the high Andes. Associates readily with Chilean and Andean Flamingos, although each species often stays slightly apart within mixed groups. James’s is the smallest New World flamingo best identified by its relatively short, stubby bill, which is yellow with a black tip. Adult and older immature have distinctive red legs and feet (can be whitish when caked with dried salt). Immature is whitish overall, like other immature flamingos."
0,Jameson's Antpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Parmoptila jamesoni,https://ebird.org/species/jamant1,"A small, slender-billed, warbler-like waxbill with pinkish-brown legs and different-looking sexes: the male has a red forehead, dull brown upperparts, and a rusty-chestnut face and underparts, while the female has a tawny-brown face and cheeks, pale buff underparts with scattered dark chevrons, and dull brown upperparts. Pairs and small groups forage by themselves or in mixed-species flocks, in the understory and middle levels of primary, secondary, and gallery forest, often near water. Eats insects, with a fondness for ants. Call is a high-pitched, downslurred “whseet.”"
0,Jameson's Firefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lagonosticta rhodopareia,https://ebird.org/species/jamfir1,"Small pinkish waxbill with a blue-gray bill and black under the tail. Found along forest edge, and in cultivation, thick woodland, and scrub. Usually in pairs or small groups. Most common vocalization is a short trill. Similar to Red-billed and Bar-breasted firefinches but shows black under the tail. Can be extremely similar to African Firefinch subspecies without gray on the head, but Jameson’s is paler and more pinkish overall."
0,Jameson's Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago jamesoni,https://ebird.org/species/andsni1,"Chunky snipe of very high elevations in the Andes. Plumage has a complicated pattern of brown, buff, and black; note extensive barring on underparts and thick, drooping bill. Might be confused with Noble Snipe, but does not have a white belly. Compared to Imperial Snipe, it is smaller and lacks the warm, cinnamon coloration. Jameson’s Snipe inhabits paramo grasslands and stunted forest near tree line. Shy and rarely encountered unless flushed, when it gives a burst of sharp, abrupt “kek” notes."
0,James's Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicoparrus jamesi,https://ebird.org/species/jamfla1,"Rather local; found at salt lakes and bogs in the high Andes. Associates readily with Chilean and Andean Flamingos, although each species often stays slightly apart within mixed groups. James’s is the smallest New World flamingo best identified by its relatively short, stubby bill, which is yellow with a black tip. Adult and older immature have distinctive red legs and feet (can be whitish when caked with dried salt). Immature is whitish overall, like other immature flamingos."
0,Jandaya Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Aratinga jandaya,https://ebird.org/species/janpar1,"Strikingly colored parakeet with a yellow head and chest, orange around the eyes and bill, orange on the belly, and blue flight feathers. Highly gregarious and noisy; can be seen flying over forests, woodlands, and agricultural areas, as well as in cities."
0,Japanese Accentor,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Prunellidae,Prunella rubida,https://ebird.org/species/japacc1,"Sparrow-sized songbird with brownish, streaked upperparts and flanks, grayish breast, and thin, pointed bill. Bright red iris and fine white streaking in the face distinctive. Occurs in high-elevation dwarf pine forests near and above the tree line during the breeding season and in streamside thickets of lower elevations during nonbreeding season. Gives intricate high-pitched songs from the top of dwarf pines. Its “tililili” call recalls the first portion of the song."
0,Japanese Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Horornis diphone,https://ebird.org/species/jabwar,"A small, plain brown warbler of dense undergrowth. Note the narrow dark line through eye and the narrow white line above the eye. Occurs in forest understory, dense shrubland, bamboo thickets, and forest edges. Usually secretive and hard to see well, but males sometimes sing from an exposed perch. Song is a long introductory tone followed by a rapid warble, “uuuuuu-guisu,” from which the Japanese name is derived. Introduced to the Hawaiian Islands where it occurs on all of the main islands."
0,Japanese Cormorant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax capillatus,https://ebird.org/species/japcor1,"A large dark cormorant of rocky marine shorelines, rarely recorded inland, unlike similar Great Cormorant, which is widespread inland. Similar to Great, but adult has more extensive white in the throat and in breeding plumage shows green (not bronze) sheen above. Juvenile usually has paler underparts than young Great. In all plumages, Japanese shows more bare orange-yellow skin above the eye than Great but has a much smaller gular pouch (bare skin of the throat)."
0,Japanese Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Eophona personata,https://ebird.org/species/japgro1,"A large finch with a powerful hulking bill that is an inhabitant of deciduous and mixed forests. Adults are not extremely sexually dimorphic, unlike the closely related Yellow-billed Grosbeak; both males and females have gray bodies with black heads, wings, and tail. Migratory race breeds in northern and central Japan and northeastern China and Russia, and winters in eastern and southeastern China, where it tends to be less common than Yellow-billed Grosbeak. Resident race present year-round in central and southern Japan."
0,Japanese Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus xanthodryas,https://ebird.org/species/arcwar3,"Small songbird, a member of the Arctic Warbler complex, this species looks essentially identical to Arctic Warbler and Kamchatka Leaf Warbler but is more evenly yellowish. Normally only distinguished in the field by breeding range and song: breeds in forests on all of the main Japanese islands except Hokkaido, where it is replaced in summer by Kamchatka Leaf Warbler. Favors foothill to montane areas with dense brushy understory; can be found in more open wooded habitats in migration and on wintering grounds. Song resembles that of Arctic in general pitch and register but is less uniform, like a more rising and falling version of Arctic’s song. Call also similar but averages lower in pitch."
0,Japanese Murrelet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Synthliboramphus wumizusume,https://ebird.org/species/japmur1,"Small, plump seabird of marine habitats, closer to shore during breeding season, in open waters otherwise; occasionally visits inlets and harbors, especially in late winter and spring. Similar to thinner-billed Ancient Murrelet, both being gray above, white below, darker flight feathers and white underwing coverts. In nonbreeding plumage, Japanese has white throat and lores, white stippling in crown; in breeding plumage, white plumes in crest much broader than Ancient. Sharp “chi-chi-chi” call recalls buntings’ flight calls."
0,Japanese Night-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Gorsachius goisagi,https://ebird.org/species/janher1,"A small brown heron with awkward-looking, hunched appearance. Occurs in dense, damp lowland and foothill forests next to bodies of water, where it hunts prey in dense cover. Paler crown and weaker crest than similar Malayan Night-Heron and lacks the white wingtips of that species. Shy and difficult to see; most readily observed during migration, when it sometimes visits more open habitats. Gives hooting calls at regular intervals, especially in early evening."
0,Japanese Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone atrocaudata,https://ebird.org/species/japfly1,"Graceful songbird of well-shaded forests, particularly stream gullies; often in more open habitat in migration. Stunning breeding male purplish-black above and white below, with a short crest, neon-blue eyerings, and long black tail streamers. Female and non-breeding male have dark gray head and chest, paler eyering, shorter crest, and chestnut-brown wings and tail, without streamers. Compare with female and non-breeding male Amur and Blyth’s paradise-flycatchers, with which Japanese overlaps on its Southeast Asian wintering grounds. Note Japanese’s contiguous dark gray throat and chest (Amur has a more sharply-demarcated black throat and gray chest), dull darkish wings (Blyth’s has brighter rufous wings), and fairly clean demarcation between gray breast and white belly (Blyth’s has a more gradual fade). Song a run-on series of coarse whistles; call a rough, nasal “bee.”"
0,Japanese Pygmy Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Yungipicus kizuki,https://ebird.org/species/pygwoo1,"Small black-and-white woodpecker with round-headed, short-billed profile. Both sexes have a pale, lightly streaked belly and white bars on the back, but only the male has a tiny red fleck at the back of the eyebrow. Often forages on thin twigs and outreaching branches too slender for other woodpeckers, hanging upside down like a tit or nuthatch. Slightly larger Gray-capped Woodpecker is longer-billed, with a buffy belly and different head pattern. Gives extremely high, thin “tsi tsi tsi” calls and a single quick, echoing drum."
0,Japanese Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Coturnix japonica,https://ebird.org/species/japqua,"A compact, cryptically-colored, very shy bird of grassy areas, including both natural meadows and some agricultural fields, where it remains hidden from view on the ground unless flushed at close range. Both sexes brown overall with a pale face, long white eyebrows, and subtle stippling and striping on the back and breast. Breeding males have a reddish-brown face and throat. Vocal mostly during the breeding season; males give a dry, explosive three-noted song from cover. Flushed birds fly with noisy, whistling wings, unlike crakes or shorebirds. Introduced to Hawaii, found on all of the main islands. A common avicultural bird, so escapees may occur around the world."
0,Japanese Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Larvivora akahige,https://ebird.org/species/japrob1,"Small songbird with distinctive orange breast and dull brown upperparts; male has dark breast band separating orange chest from pale belly. Sticks to the undergrowth in both its montane breeding grounds and lowland wintering grounds, though its presence in the former may be given away by its loud song: a trill following a single loud introductory note. Occasionally found in parks and gardens on migration."
0,Japanese Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus semitorques,https://ebird.org/species/jasowl1,"Small grayish owl with prominent ear tufts and dark red eyes, found in lowland and hill forests, forest edges, parks, and gardens. Ryukyu Scops-Owl and Oriental Scops-Owl both have yellow to orangish eyes; Japanese has a more complete collar and more contrastingly pale facial disc. Vocalizations include a variety of meowing, croaking, and barking calls, as well as shrill screeches."
0,Japanese Sparrowhawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter gularis,https://ebird.org/species/japspa1,"Typical Accipiter hawk. Adult slaty gray above and finely barred with brownish orange below. Smaller and more compact-looking than Eurasian Sparrowhawk. Soaring adults can be distinguished from Chinese Sparrowhawk by the lack of dark wingtips and striped (instead of solidly pale) underwings. In all plumages, heavily marked underwing coverts distinguish this species from Chinese Sparrowhawk. Breeds in a variety of forested hill and lowland habitats; wintering birds can also be found in more open habitats, such as forest edge and fields."
0,Japanese Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus cardis,https://ebird.org/species/japthr1,"Elusive thrush, seldom seen far from cover. Favors well-shaded streamsides, gullies, and valleys in broadleaf hill forests during the breeding season, but can be found in sparser habitats in the non-breeding season. Adult male sharply marked and beautiful if seen well, combining coal-black upperparts with a snow-white belly punctuated with dark speckles. Immature male gray above, belly tinged orange. Female medium brown above with white underparts marked with both dark speckles and an orange suffusion; can be confused with female Gray-backed Thrush, but dark markings in Japanese extend to lower belly (restricted to the throat in Gray-backed). Rich, lengthy song often very repetitive."
0,Japanese Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Parus minor,https://ebird.org/species/gretit4,"Large and pugnacious, this common tit is found in a wide range of wooded habitats, from dense hill forests to manicured city parks. Found throughout much of East Asia, this species is closely-related to the more brightly-colored Great Tit, from which it was split as a distinct species. Adult has a flashy white cheek on a black head, a black stripe on a white belly, and gray wings with a hint of green near the shoulder. Juveniles are duller, replacing the adult’s black with gray. Very vocal; song is a bright “tzi-hei tzi-hei!”; also gives loud chips, seeps, and harsh “tzi-tzi-tzshhhhhh.”"
0,Japanese Wagtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Motacilla grandis,https://ebird.org/species/japwag1,"Large, boldly patterned, long-tailed songbird of waterside areas, particularly fast-flowing streams but also rivers, pools, inland lakes, and coastal areas. Adult male velveteen black with white belly, wings, throat, brow, and outer tail feathers. Adult female similar but grayish black above. Juvenile similar, with soft, pale gray upperparts; juvenile of Japanese subspecies of White Wagtail similar but shows white arc behind eye. Calls distinctively buzzy."
0,Japanese Waxwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Bombycillidae,Bombycilla japonica,https://ebird.org/species/japwax1,"The only waxwing endemic to the old world, this species is similar to its Bohemian relative, but with pink instead of yellow tail tips and a yellow-tinged belly. Irruptive and inconsistent in its movements during the colder months, following crops of berries to wintering grounds, where it frequently gathers in large and noisy feeding flocks. Combination of dark mask, loose crest, and overall brown coloration distinguish it from similarly-sized non-waxwing species in its range."
0,Japanese Wood-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba janthina,https://ebird.org/species/jawpig1,"The largest pigeon in the region, with dark purplish plumage except for metallic green around the neck. Generally uncommon endemic of offshore Japanese and to a lesser extent Chinese and Korean islands. Occurs in mature broadleaf forests, where it forages on the ground or in canopy. Also favors pines, especially in the Ryukyu Islands. Rustles about loudly when feeding. Deep call and slow moaning song may recall the everyday Rock Pigeon."
0,Java Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Padda oryzivora,https://ebird.org/species/javspa,"A small, plump finch with a very thick pink bill. The black head and white cheek patch are distinctive. Juveniles have a similar color pattern but are grayer. Social; forages in flocks and roosts communally. Forages in rice fields, grasslands, meadows, and urban and suburban areas (in introduced range). Call consists of one or more musical chirps. Native to the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali, where now quite rare. Introduced widely across the globe including India, Philippines, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and the Hawaiian Islands."
0,Javan Banded-Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Hydrornis guajanus,https://ebird.org/species/banpit2,"Beautiful ground-dweller with black mask, clean white throat, and finely barred underparts. Male has an egg-yolk-yellow eyebrow, royal-blue “bib”, and black crown. Female has a dull tan-yellow eyebrow and brown crown. Both sexes have a bright blue tail and a white “racing stripe” down the edge of the wing. Inhabits a range of wooded habitats, from primary wet forest to overgrown plantations and dry scrub, in the lowlands and foothills of Java and Bali. Forages on the ground, either singly or in pairs. Gives a loud, bright “whOW!” and a low rolling trill."
0,Javan Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis banyumas,https://ebird.org/species/hibfly3,"A medium-sized flycatcher with strikingly different male and female plumages. Male is beautifully colored, with deep blue upperparts, mostly orange underparts, and a white belly. Female is much duller, with a grayish head, gray-brown wings, a rufous tail, and rufous-washed underparts. Found at low and middle elevations in forest, especially in densely vegetated ravines and stands of bamboo. Song mixes melodious warbling and whistling with thin “seet” notes. Calls are a loud “chek” or “tak,” reminiscent of stones tapping. Male resembles male Mangove Blue Flycatcher, but generally found in different habitat and separated by darker blue back and more uniformly rufous underparts, including the chin. Female can be confused with many other flycatchers, but is usually identified by its combination of a rufous-washed breast and a lack of wingbars."
0,Javan Cochoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Cochoa azurea,https://ebird.org/species/javcoc1,"Slow-moving and highly elusive chunky Javan endemic, found only in montane and foothill forests. Generally scarce and difficult to pick out in the dark forest due to its coloration and inactive behavior. Males are entirely blue, with some paler highlights on the crown and wings. Female has a mostly dark brownish body with blue most evident in the wings, tail, and crown. Combination of size, shape, and behavior serve to distinguish this infrequently-encountered species from other dark blue forest birds, such as Javan Whistling-Thrush and the Javan subspecies of Sunda Robin. Vocalizations include high, thin whistles and harsh chattering."
0,Javan Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina javensis,https://ebird.org/species/javcus1,"Burly bird with a dark and heavy bill. Gray above and pale whitish below. Smudgy dark patch around the eye is present on both sexes, but more prominent on males. Females can have faint barring on the underparts, and average paler overall. Sunda Cuckooshrike is darker, with a gray belly and darker mask. Like other large cuckooshrikes, often perches up prominently in bare trees, hawking for insects from exposed perches. Typically singly, or in pairs or small loose groups. Regularly flicks wings. Quite vocal, often giving a loud, rippling “wheeEEIR!”, as well as a squeaky “whee’yiiIIP!”"
0,Javan Flameback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Chrysocolaptes strictus,https://ebird.org/species/javfla1,"Dashing and uncommon pale-eyed woodpecker, found only in lowland and foothill woodlands and forests on Bali and eastern Java. Note lustrous golden-brown back and wings, black-and-white barring on the sides, black mask, and well-defined scaling on the neck and breast.

0,Javan Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus javensis,https://ebird.org/species/javfro3,"Endemic to Java, where it is the only frogmouth. Fairly typical-looking small frogmouth, with brown plumage broken up by white patches and pale barring on the tail. Readily separated from nightjars by its upright pose and forward-facing eyes, and from owls by its bristly “whiskered” face, lack of a facial disc, large broad-based bill, and long tail. Inhabits a wide range of wooded habitats from lowlands up into montane foothills, from dense rainforests to the edges of large plantations with suitable tall growth. Nocturnal, and can be difficult to spot on day roost. Gives a variety of calls, including a series of descending whistles, a high-pitched growl followed by a strangled whistle, and short, grating screams."
0,Javan Fulvetta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Alcippe pyrrhoptera,https://ebird.org/species/javful1,"Unremarkable-looking warm brown songbird. Endemic to Java’s montane and submontane broadleaf forests, where it is a common member of mixed flocks. Note warm rusty-toned wings and tail, long-tailed and round-headed profile, and slender dark line above the eye (sometimes inconspicuous). Song is a sad-sounding series of whistles. Calls include a fast rattling call, as well as a high-pitched, tinkling “ji’jink.”"
0,Javan Green-Magpie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Cissa thalassina,https://ebird.org/species/shtmag1,"Extremely rare and nearing extinction in the wild, this fluorescent green Javan endemic with a black bandit’s mask and bulbous lipstick-red bill is an unmistakable and unforgettable sight for any birder lucky enough to glimpse one. Found only in foothill forests, often joining mixed flocks. Can be quite loud, even when hidden away in dense middle levels of forest, giving chattering shrieks and a vibrant, liquid-sounding “wee’da’da!”"
0,Javan Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Halcyon cyanoventris,https://ebird.org/species/javkin1,"Large kingfisher with a massive lipstick-red bill. Note dark head, dark chestnut throat and chest, purplish body, electric blue wings, and large black shoulder patch. Bright white wing patches revealed in flight.

Gives high piping screams, often in series."
0,Javan Munia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lonchura leucogastroides,https://ebird.org/species/javmun1,"Plain brown munia with a dark face and a white belly. Similar in appearance to White-rumped Munia, with which it overlaps in southern Sumatra; look out for dark, instead of white rump. Inhabits lowland fields, meadows, wetlands, and edge. Occasionally mixes with other species of munias, particularly when food is plentiful; otherwise found in small flocks, in pairs, and singly. Native to Indonesia; introduced to parts of Malaysia and Singapore."
0,Javan Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Acridotheres javanicus,https://ebird.org/species/whvmyn,"Originally restricted to the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali, this crested myna has since been introduced to Singapore, Taiwan, and various parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. Dark gray overall with a spiffy erect crest and a bright yellowish-orange bill. Darker than Jungle Myna, with which it overlaps in both its native and introduced ranges. Also compare with Crested Myna; note Javan’s brighter bill and white vent. Bold and social, foraging in farms, parks, and gardens. Roosts in large noisy flocks, often close to human habitation."
0,Javan Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium castanopterum,https://ebird.org/species/javowl1,"Chunky small owl with a big rounded head. Note finely barred head, bright chestnut back and wings, and white underparts marked with long brown streaks. The only owlet on Java; shape and coloration eliminate any scops-owl. Unlike Collared Owlet, this is a primarily nocturnal species, only rarely remaining active through the day. Inhabits forest and forest edge from lowlands up into foothills. Song is a barbet-like series of trilling barks which accelerates rapidly before ending suddenly."
0,Javan Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius javanicus,https://ebird.org/species/javplo1,"Relatively small plain plover, found from Java east through the Lesser Sundas. Brown above and white below, with a neat white collar, forehead, and eyebrow. Brown shoulder spur sometimes forms a complete thin band across the chest. Breeding adults have orange tinging behind the eye and around the collar. Juvenile is similar to non-breeding adult, but has pale-fringed upper body feathers. Very similar to Kentish Plover, but note Javan’s warm brown patch behind ears, lack of orange on the crown in breeding plumage, and paler legs. Malaysian Plover is also similar, but always has white fringes on brown upper body feathers, and warm tones on the head. A coastal species, found on beaches, mudflats, estuaries, fishponds, and wet fields. Gives soft peeps and a questioning “week?”"

Handsome in breeding plumage, with creamy head, dark red breast, and lacy black plumes on the back. Streaky brown nonbreeding plumage is nearly indistinguishable from other pond-herons. Forages in rice paddies, pond and lake edges, and mangroves."
0,Javan Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus angelinae,https://ebird.org/species/jasowl2,"Typical scops-owl, endemic to Java’s montane and foothill forests. Favors the upper and middle levels of the forest, frequently roosting and foraging in the lower canopy. Warm brown with black streaks on the chest and prominent white eyebrows. Also note bright orange eyes. Collared Scops-Owl can be similar, but is larger overall, with darker eyes, more solid facial border, and less contrasting eyebrows. Quiet for a scops-owl, vocalizing fairly infrequently--listen for its squealing “eEEE-eeee”, which often has a trembling quality. Also gives sharper, shorter squeal calls, and a gruff “wurk.”"
0,Javan Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga mystacalis,https://ebird.org/species/scasun1,"Medium-sized sunbird of foothill forest and forest edge on Java; uncommon to rare in upper montane and lowland habitats. Forages actively in pairs, mixed flocks, or singly. Both sexes are very similar to Crimson Sunbird, but note Javan's bright white belly and sides. Female Javans can also be confused with White-flanked and the Leptocoma sunbirds, but have more white on the sides and belly than those species. Song is a very flat and insect-like series of dry “chit” notes; also gives a sparrow-like “chiweet.”"
0,Javan Tesia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Tesia superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/javtes1,"Tiny short-tailed ground-dweller, restricted to foothill and montane forests on Java. Favors areas with dense, tangled undergrowth, in which it bounces around actively. Olive-brown with a gray head and chest. Black line through the eye gives this little bird a strongly “eyebrowed” appearance. Due to size and dense habitat, this tiny warbler can be difficult to track down; listen for its song, a tumbling, jumbled series of beautiful high-pitched notes. Also note call, a dry rattling trill."
0,Javan Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Harpactes reinwardtii,https://ebird.org/species/javtro1,"Beautiful and highly range-restricted trogon found only in Java’s far western belt of volcanoes, where it inhabits montane and foothill forests at 900-2500 meters. Unmistakable, decked out in all the colors of the rainbow: note bright red bill, yellow breast, orange belly, olive-green head and chest, glossy blue-green back, and purple-and-green bare facial skin.

0,Javan Whistling-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myophonus glaucinus,https://ebird.org/species/javwht1,"Chunky dark blue bird. Brightest blue on the nape and shoulder. Readily distinguished from similar species by shape, uniform plumage, and dark bill. Often spreads its short tail in a rather unimpressive gesture. Endemic to Java and Bali, where it inhabits foothill and montane forests at 800-2400 meters. Typically encountered close to or on the ground, but will also perch up on branches at mid-height. Favors areas with rocky outcrops, sometimes (but not always) near water. Can be quite tame, especially in areas frequented by people. Gives a sharp, resonant “tsee-chk-chk!”"
0,Javan Woodcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Scolopax saturata,https://ebird.org/species/duswoo4,"Rare and reclusive long-billed inhabitant of moist montane and foothill forests at 1350-3000 meters. Dark brown and heavily patterned overall, with densest patterning on the back. Small pale patch present on upper belly. Forages in dense vegetation, flushing explosively if sufficiently startled. Can be quite tame, allowing close approach if located. Flies between and sings from display perches, giving a fast-paced series of “chu” notes. Also gives a high-pitched sneezing call, and a lower harsh note."
0,Jelski's Black-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Knipolegus signatus,https://ebird.org/species/andtyr3,"Rare flycatcher found in cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes in northern and central Peru, barely reaching over the border into southeastern Ecuador. Male is dark sooty gray; female is grayish-olive with pale wingbars and faint streaking below. Similar to White-winged Black-Tyrant, but male Jelski’s is grayer and lacks white in the wings (which is usually only evident in flight) and female Jelski’s is much darker, especially on the underparts. No overlap with Plumbeous Black-Tyrant."
0,Jerdon's Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Chrysomma altirostre,https://ebird.org/species/jerbab1,"Warm brown babbler with a distinctive round-headed and short-billed profile. Extremely localized, restricted to disappearing patches of tall riverine grassland and reedbeds. Usually in pairs or small groups.

Male shows bright white patches near the wingtips and on the edges of the tail that are buffy-brown in females. Large-tailed Nightjar is very similar; in Jerdon’s, look for less-streaked crown and smaller wing patches. Indian Nightjar is smaller and much more intricately patterned, lacking the white throat. Song is a strange bubbling “bwr-wr-wr,” usually heard at dusk or dawn in wooded areas."
0,Jet Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacra nigricans,https://ebird.org/species/jetant1,"Small slender antbird, found in pairs skulking through low tangles in forest and edges. Male is very dark black with obvious white fringes on shoulder. Female similar to male but gray instead of black and shows white streaks on throat. Could be confused with Dot-winged Antwren, which is less skulky and has larger white spots on wing and tail; also note very different female plumage.

Female is entirely brown and might be confused for a schiffornis, but note smaller size and white underwings. Most often noticed by its voice, a distinctive rising nasal “tuwee!”."
0,Jobi Manucode,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Manucodia jobiensis,https://ebird.org/species/jobman1,"A large bird of lowland rainforest. All black with red eye. Purplish-blue iridescence on wings and tail and iridescent scaling on the chest and back. Shy and little known. Best seen at fruiting trees. Very similar to Crinkle-collared Manucode, but Jobi is usually found at lower elevation and lacks the bump on its head. Trumpet Manucode co-occurs but is smaller and has a loose mane of feathers around its neck. Song, a series of hollow “hoo” notes."
0,Jocotoco Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria ridgelyi,https://ebird.org/species/jocant1,"Large antpitta with a tiny range in southeast Ecuador. Unmistakable. Typical antpitta shape: plump and short-tailed with long legs, like a grapefruit on stilts. Brown above and pale silvery-gray below with a black cap and thick white mustache patch. Rare and local on or near the ground in the upper subtropical zone from around 2,300 to 2,600 m; especially fond of bamboo patches. Essentially never seen away from the Tapichalaca Reserve in Ecuador, where several birds have been trained to eat worms."
0,Johanna's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris johannae,https://ebird.org/species/johsun2,"A large, long-billed sunbird of forest and forest edge, sometimes venturing into gardens and farms. Both sexes have a distinctive long and mostly straight bill with a noticeable droop towards the tip. Males are iridescent green above and dark below with a green throat, a red-and-purple chest, and a maroon belly. Females are light brown above with a subtle eye-line, and pale with fine brown streaking below. Most likely to be confused with Splendid Sunbird, but look for the male’s green throat and maroon rather than red belly, and the female’s finely streaked underparts. Call is a descending whistled “tiuw.” The song is a complex jumble of whistled notes, not unlike that of other sunbirds."
0,Jos Plateau Indigobird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Vidua maryae,https://ebird.org/species/jopind1,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Rock Firefinches. Breeding males are black with green iridescence and a pale brownish panel in the wings. Females and non-breeding males are streaky and brown on the back and pale below, with a bold facial pattern. The bill is whitish and the legs pale purple. A scarce, local, and poorly known species. Found in rocky areas within savanna. Given current knowledge, can only be confidently identified by vocalizations. Imitates the vocalizations of its host, Rock Firefinch, including soft “teew” whistles, a descending trill, “tep” notes, and “pit-pit-pit” calls. These are often mixed into a scratchy jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Josephine's Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Charmosyna josefinae,https://ebird.org/species/joslor1,"A medium-sized, long-tailed lorikeet of foothill and lower montane forest. Red head and chest, green back, broad black line around the back of the head and a yellow undertail and tip. Similar to Fairy Lorikeet, but Josephine’s Lorikeet is distinctly larger, has a dark patch on the belly and lacks streaking on the chest. Travels in pairs or small groups looking for flowering trees where it associates with other species. Also similar to red morph Papuan Lorikeet, but Josephine’s is smaller with a much shorter tail. Call, a high-pitch, ringing “srik!” note."
0,Jouanin's Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Bulweria fallax,https://ebird.org/species/joupet,"An all-dark, pigeon-sized petrel. Very bulky, with broad wings and a heavy, dark bill. Similar to Bulwer’s Petrel, but Jouanin’s appears heavier overall with a shorter tail, a larger bill, and no white on the wings. Strong flier, gliding often with occasional wingbeats, and staying close to the water."
0,Joyful Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Chlorocichla laetissima,https://ebird.org/species/joygre1,"A large, richly colored greenbul, yellow-olive on the back and yellow below with a red eye. Found locally in humid forest at middle elevations, usually in groups, at middle levels of the forest and in the sub-canopy. More colorful than other greenbuls that overlap in range. Similar to Prigogine’s Greenbul, but distinguished by the lack of gray on the face and lack of white on the chin. Named for its exuberant song, several chattering calls that ascend and accelerate into a bubbly, explosive sequence, usually given by multiple birds together."
0,Jungle Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Argya striata,https://ebird.org/species/junbab2,"This familiar ash-brown colored babbler has a yellow bill and a dark brow in front of the eye that contrasts with its pale eye giving it a perpetual “angry” look. It has vague streaking on the upperparts, diffuse mottling on its throat, and barring on its tail. The multiple races vary slightly in color and strength of markings except the race somervillei of the NW peninsula which has dark brown outer wing feathers that contrast with the rest of the wing. They are often seen in noisy flocks hopping on the ground and flicking litter in search of food."
0,Jungle Bush-Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Perdicula asiatica,https://ebird.org/species/jubqua1,"A small, plump terrestrial bird, roughly spherical in shape. Identified by its rusty throat and rusty-and-white eyebrow. Males have barred underparts while females have uniform pinkish cinnamon underparts. Found in dry stony scrub jungles and dry grasslands. Often seen in groups of 2–7 (but can occur in groups up to 20). Generally secretive until flushed when it suddenly bursts into flight, flying with weak whirring wingbeats low over the ground before quickly dropping into cover. Feeds on grass,seeds, and small insects."
0,Jungle Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Acridotheres fuscus,https://ebird.org/species/junmyn1,"Typical “crested myna,” dark gray overall (darkest on head and wings) with white vent and wing patches, yellow-orange bill and legs, and small tufted crest above base of bill. Contrary to its name, usually found in open areas such as farmland, fields, and parks. Similar in appearance to Javan Myna, but shorter-crested, paler overall, and with partially black bill (Javan has entirely yellowish-orange bill). Song consists of harsh, crackling, yet melodic notes."
0,Jungle Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgus indicus,https://ebird.org/species/grynig2,"Gray-brown nightjar of wooded, open grassy, and scrubby areas; not restricted to jungles. Intricately patterned, with a golden patch behind the ear (often not visible on a resting bird) and pale tan spots on the wings. Male shows bright white patches near the wingtips and on the edges of the tail that are buffy-brown in females. Similar Savanna Nightjar is much more densely patterned and lacks the tan wing spots; Savanna also tends to roost on the ground, versus in trees for Jungle Nightjar. Song is utterly alien-sounding and unique: a long series of bouncing “pooKIHpooKIHpooKIH” notes, comparable to a cartoon laser gun."
0,Jungle Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium radiatum,https://ebird.org/species/junowl1,"Squat little owl with dense barring all over the body. Lacks the false eyes on the back of the head possessed by many other owlets. Gives bursts of loud hollow trills, comparable to barbets, as well as a mellow “kaaaooo-kaaaaooo-kah-ow!” A forest species, found in densely wooded areas in lowlands and foothills. Most active at dawn and dusk."
0,Jungle Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia sylvatica,https://ebird.org/species/junpri1,"Dull brown prinia. Largely devoid of eye-catching field marks: gray-brown above and white below with pale eyebrow. Plain Prinia can be very similar, but Jungle averages larger and more thickset, with a heavier bill and weaker eyebrows. Look for this skulker in dry scrubby tangles, often in areas intermixed with boulders. Forages close to the ground. Song is a rollicking, repetitive “ti’li’lew-ti’li’lew-ti’le’lew.” Also gives various chip notes, as well as a loud chatter when agitated."
0,Junin Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps taczanowskii,https://ebird.org/species/jungre1,"Critically endangered grebe found only on Lake Junín in the high Andes of central Peru. Adults are gray and white with a ruby-red eye; young birds have a brownish tinge. Extremely similar to the far more common Silvery Grebe, but Junin Grebe is slightly larger with a longer bill, a skinnier neck, darker flanks, and a paler bill. These differences are more evident when both species are present, to allow for direct comparison. Not easily seen or identified from the lakeshore; a boat is usually needed for close-up views."
0,Junin Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus gettyae,https://ebird.org/species/juntap1,"Poorly known Peruvian endemic found only in high Andean cloud forest northeast of the city of Huancayo. It was described to science in 2013. Adult male is plain gray, lacking the rufous barring on the lower underparts shown by Rufous-vented Tapaculo and Trilling Tapaculo. Female plumage not yet known with certainty. Younger birds are heavily marked with bars or scales. Best identified by range and voice. Typical song is a lengthy series that starts out with simple notes and gradually transitions into sputtering bursts."
0,Juniper Titmouse,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Baeolophus ridgwayi,https://ebird.org/species/juntit1,"Possibly the plainest bird in North America—medium gray overall with no patterning. Despite dull plumage it is undeniably cute with a large eye and plain face. Crest is distinctive. Aptly named, they are found in dry juniper woodlands (and occasionally seen away from junipers). Visits bird feeders in the correct habitat."
0,Kabobo Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis kaboboensis,https://ebird.org/species/chtapa2,"A slender, plain slate-gray apalis with red-brown eyes, a pale belly, and a white-tipped tail; female is paler than the male. Juvenile more greenish-yellow than adult. One of Africa’s most poorly known birds, restricted to the Kabobo highlands in Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is resident in the canopy of tall montane forest between 1600 and 2500 meters of elevation. The voice is uncertain, but reported to be a dry buzzy trill like that of Chestnut-throated Apalis. The similar Gray Apalis differs from Kabobo in having a white, not gray, throat."
0,Kadavu Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura personata,https://ebird.org/species/kanfan1,"Mouse-brown above and white below. Head brown with a white throat above a variable black band. White stripe extends behind eye. Long tail is often fanned. Prefers forest habitats, especially along waterways.

0,Kakapo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Strigopidae,Strigops habroptila,https://ebird.org/species/kakapo2,"New Zealand’s largest endemic parrot. Flightless, nocturnal, and solitary, confined to several predator-free offshore islands. Adults have a moss-green coloring mottled with black and yellow on top. Shows gray legs, feet, and bill with a unique pale owl-like face. A solitary bird that forages on the ground and climbs trees at night. During the breeding season, males gather on lek-breeding “arenas,” a series of bowls and tracks where they give deep, resonating booming calls to attract females. Calls can carry several kilometers."
0,Kalahari Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cercotrichas paena,https://ebird.org/species/kasrob1,"A medium-sized sandy-brown scrub-robin with pale unstreaked underparts. It has a brownish back and an auburn-rusty rump and tail with a white-tipped black terminal band. Pairs frequent thickets and clumps of thorn trees in Kalahari woodland, where they forage on the ground with the tail often cocked and rocking sideways, or perch in trees singing a varied musical song that often reveals their presence. The similar Red-backed Scrub-Robin differs in having white on the wing and a streaked breast."
0,Kalij Pheasant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophura leucomelanos,https://ebird.org/species/kalphe,"A distinctive pheasant with bare red facial skin, a backward-pointing crest, and a vertically compressed tail. Males are iridescent black and silver. Females are grayish-brown. Coloration varies considerably throughout its range, with northeastern birds averaging the darkest. Occurs in forested areas, usually in hilly or mountainous regions. Overlaps with Silver Pheasant in the north of its range, with which it produces confusing intergrades. Native to South and Southeast Asia and introduced to the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and western Oahu. Males give a soft crow, other calls include low grunts and high-pitched squeals."
0,Kalkadoon Grasswren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Amytornis ballarae,https://ebird.org/species/kalgra1,"Small rusty-brown bird with finely streaked plumage and long cocked tail, found in rocky areas and gorges with spinifex clumps in the Mount Isa region of northwestern Queensland. Upperparts dark gray-brown, underparts rich gray, adult female with rich reddish-brown flanks, male with gray flanks. Usually seen scampering around on the ground on rocky ledges and among boulders.

0,Kamchatka Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus examinandus,https://ebird.org/species/arcwar2,"Small songbird, essentially identical in plumage to Arctic Warbler and Japanese Leaf Warbler. A late spring migrant, often moving up the Chinese coast from Southeast Asia in mid- to late May. Breeds in the taiga forests and forest edges of the Kamchatka peninsula, Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. Call is a low “chuck,” averaging lower than that of Japanese Leaf and Arctic Warblers. Song is a broken series of chattering notes, with each segment being in more discrete phrases than the more consistent, higher-pitched song of Arctic."
0,Kandt's Waxbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Estrilda kandti,https://ebird.org/species/kanwax1,"Pretty waxbill that is gray, black, and white, with red highlights. The bright red rump is conspicuous in flight. Found along forest edge and clearings, usually in grassy areas, in pairs or small flocks. The calls include high-pitched “tsik” and “tseet” notes which are often given in chorus by a flock, especially in flight. Similar to Black-crowned Waxbill, but darker and browner overall, with a black rather than white undertail."
0,Karamoja Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis karamojae,https://ebird.org/species/karapa1,"A slender ash-gray apalis with a striking diagnostic white panel on the folded wing and two pairs of white outer tail feathers which are usually obvious on the dark tail. Upperparts are darker than underparts. Presumably resident in areas of semi-arid shrubland, particularly those with scattered thorn trees along dry watercourses. Pairs sing a swaying musical duet, typically a repeated “dree-dooo-tee-too” for up to a minute, interspersed with other musical notes, buzzes, ticks, and trills."
0,Karoo Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Emarginata schlegelii,https://ebird.org/species/karcha1,"A large, slender, long-tailed gray chat with bold white outer tail feathers that frame the black tail. South African races are slaty gray with grayish rumps, while Namibian races are smaller and paler with whitish rumps. This is a bold chat that perches conspicuously on fences and shrubs throughout arid rangelands, dropping to the ground to forage before flying strongly and occasionally distantly to another perch, showing the diagnostic tail pattern. The Tractrac Chat is shorter-tailed, prefers hyper-arid barren environments, and has a distinctive V-shaped black wedge in the tail that the Karoo Chat lacks."
0,Karoo Long-billed Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Certhilauda subcoronata,https://ebird.org/species/klblar1,"A large, slender lark with a long, thin decurved bill and long legs. Features can be variable, but generally the species has rufous upperparts, grayish coloration on the back of the neck, and a lightly streaked chest. As the similar-looking long-billed larks have separate ranges, location is a key factor in identification. This species strides purposefully through dry open shrubland, running quickly before pausing to dig in soil or pick at a shrub for invertebrate prey, seeds, or fruit. In a characteristic display the male flies low to the ground before flying directly up 10 to 15 meters, and then closing its wings and plummeting toward the ground while typically emitting a two-note “hit-seeeoooouuu” whistle, the second note descending. This call and similar ones can also be given from the ground. Most larks in the same range are smaller and more compact, with smaller bills and shorter legs."
0,Karoo Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia maculosa,https://ebird.org/species/karpri1,"An active warbler with a long graduated tail that is sometimes cocked. It is dull brown above and pale below with extensive streaks and blotches on the underparts that often extend to the throat and belly. Pairs frequent fynbos, strandveld, Karoo shrublands, and gardens, where they are active gleaners of insects, occasionally hopping on the ground. The typical song is a reedy piping “kli” note repeated 4-15 times, with scratchy buzzing notes interspersed. The similar Drakensberg Prinia differs from the Karoo Prinia by having warmer upperparts, yellower underparts, and finer streaks that are mostly restricted to the chest."
0,Karoo Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cercotrichas coryphoeus,https://ebird.org/species/kasrob2,"A drab, gray-brown scrub-robin with bold white tail tips, eyebrow, and throat markings. Pairs are active and noisy in dry scrubby thickets and arid brush, where they vocalize prominently from the top of shrubs, fences, and rocks, or hop and run around on the ground, sometimes with their tails cocked. A scolding harsh contact call and warbler-like song draws attention to them. Other scrub-robins in the same range are more strikingly colored, and chats lack the white tail tips of Karoo Scrub-Robin."
0,Karoo Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus smithi,https://ebird.org/species/karthr1,"A typical mostly olive-brown thrush, with rufous coloration restricted to the center of the belly. It is most easily identified by range. Pairs occupy dense scrub and thickets in arid savanna and Karoo, grassland, and urban gardens on the South African highveld. The species gives a varied song and typical thrush “chk-chk” or thin “tseeep” calls. It is an understory specialist that sometimes skulks, but at other times can be quite bold. The similar Olive Thrush differs from Karoo Thrush in its rufous (not olive) flanks, its brown (not yellow-orange) eye-ring, its dark brown (not yellow) base to the upper mandible of the bill, and its streakier throat."
0,Kashmir Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula subrubra,https://ebird.org/species/kasfly1,"Stubby little flycatcher with a highly restricted range; breeds in a corner of the northwestern Himalayas and winters in isolated pockets of hill forest in southern India and Sri Lanka.

0,Kashmir Nutcracker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Nucifraga multipunctata,https://ebird.org/species/sponut1,"A jay-like bird with a long pointed bill, a black cap, and white spots all over. Very similar to Eurasian Nutcracker, but the Kashmir Nutcracker appears whiter overall with more white on the back, underparts, undertail, and tail tips. Forages in conifers for nuts and seeds, occasionally descending to the ground. Calls include loud, harsh “kraaa” notes."
0,Kashmir Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta cashmirensis,https://ebird.org/species/kasnut1,"Unremarkable-looking nuthatch with a highly restricted range. Found in hill and montane forests; favors coniferous-dominated forest types. Slaty-gray with dark “extended mask” stripe and buffy-orange underparts (paler in female). Chestnut-bellied Nuthatch can be similar; note Kashmir’s pale throat, paler underparts, and unbarred vent in all plumages. Calls include a tortured-sounding nasal scream."
0,Katanga Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus katangae,https://ebird.org/species/kamwea1,"This red-eyed masked-weaver has a plain olive-green back and pink-brown legs. The breeding male has a black face mask, with the black band on the forehead above the bill varying from broad in the south to narrow farther north. Female and juvenile are dull and inseparable from other masked-weavers. Pairs and colonies are localized residents of reedbeds, wetlands and adjacent woodland, in a narrow global range between northeastern Zambia and southeastern DRC. The breeding males of Katanga and Southern masked-weavers are very similar, but the former are smaller, have some saffron around the masks, and have darker green backs and rumps; breeding male Tanganyika and Lake Lufira Masked-Weavers have more burnt-orange around the face and underparts, and ranges do not overlap."
0,Kauai Akialoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Akialoa stejnegeri,https://ebird.org/species/greaki4,"Extinct, last reported in 1969."
0,Kauai Amakihi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri,https://ebird.org/species/kauama,"An uncommon Hawaiian honeycreeper of forests on Kauai. Males are bright yellow and females are grayer. Larger and thicker-billed than amakihis on other islands. Occurs in native forest above 3,000 feet elevation in the understory and forest canopy where it searches for nectar, insects, and fruit. Song is a trill that does not change in pitch or speed. Call is a nasal “chee.”"
0,Kauai Elepaio,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Chasiempis sclateri,https://ebird.org/species/elepai5,"A small flycatcher of forested habitats on Kauai. Adults have a gray back and white wingbars, while immatures are reddish brown with buffy wingbars. Common in native forest at higher elevations. Bold and curious; not afraid of people and may follow hikers. Often holds tail cocked up at an angle. Male song consists of two notes that rise and fall and have a squeaky, rubber ducky quality. Both sexes give a variety of soft calls and scolding notes. Responds to pishing and squeaking."
0,Negros Bleeding-heart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba keayi,https://ebird.org/species/nebhea1,"A very rare medium-sized ground dove of foothill forest floor on Negros and Panay. Iridescent greenish-blue on the head and sides to the chest, scaled on the upper back, with brownish flight feathers. White underparts narrow from the throat down the chest to the belly. Obvious white crescents mark the wing and sides of the chest. Note the red “bleeding heart” in the center of the chest. Unlikely to be mistaken if seen well. The only other dove likely to flush from the ground would be Asian Emerald Dove. Song is a short, accelerating series of low notes."
0,Kelp Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Chloephaga hybrida,https://ebird.org/species/kelgoo1,"A distinctive goose found locally along rocky coasts and in intertidal areas; very rarely away from the shoreline. Usually in pairs or small groups, readily associating with other geese. Pure white male stands out at long range, but handsomely patterned female can be cryptic—note her white tail, pale brown cap. First-year males are variably intermediate in plumage between adult males and females. In flight, females show bold black-and-white wing pattern like other austral geese such as Upland Goose."
0,Kelp Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus dominicanus,https://ebird.org/species/kelgul,"Large dark-backed gull. Few similar species in much of its range. Usually coastal.

Juvenile is duller, lacking facial ornaments. Restricted to a single subantarctic island, Kerguelen, where it is the only cormorant and is commonly seen foraging in inshore waters. Although they do not overlap in range, most other Southern Ocean “blue-eyed” shags are larger, with whiter sides to the head, and many have white wingbars. Call is a grunting wheeze."
0,Kerguelen Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna virgata,https://ebird.org/species/kerter1,"A slender tern with a short bill. Breeding adults are dark-capped with an ashy-gray body, a strongly contrasting white cheek stripe and rump, and a reddish bill and legs. In flight, underwings and uppertail are mostly grayish. In non-breeding plumage resembles other non-breeding terns, but note structure. Restricted to a handful of subantarctic islands, where it forages in inshore waters; common on Kerguelen and uncommon on Crozet and Marion. In breeding plumage, the larger Antarctic Tern is paler gray than Kerguelen, with a larger bill and whitish (not grayish) uppertail and underwings. Arctic Terns (in non-breeding plumage) only overlap with Kerguelen Terns (in breeding plumage) in austral summer."
0,Kermadec Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma neglecta,https://ebird.org/species/kerpet,"Fairly large and thickset petrel of offshore tropical and subtropical waters across the Pacific; not seen from mainland. Plumage is highly variable (white-bodied and white-headed, dark-headed, or wholly dark), but all types have a white flash on the wingtip, including diagnostic white feather shafts on upperwing, which enhance this petrel’s resemblance to jaegers and skuas. Indeed, sometimes Kermadec Petrels chase and pirate other petrels, as do jaegers and skuas. Herald Petrel is very similar, but is smaller and slimmer with a longer and more tapered tail, and lacks white shafts on upperwings."
0,Killdeer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius vociferus,https://ebird.org/species/killde,"Common, large plover. Slender shape with long wings and tail. Look for two black breast bands, unique among plovers in its range. Often nests near human development: parking lots, school roofs, road edges, and farms, usually on bare gravel. Adults perform broken-wing displays to distract predators from their nests and young. Gathers in larger numbers in migration and winter, often in fields with short grass or barren dirt. Occurs throughout North America; more local along the Pacific coast of northern South America. Can be very vocal; listen for loud namesake “kill-deer” call."
0,Kilombero Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus burnieri,https://ebird.org/species/kilwea1,"A fairly small and slim weaver with a relatively slender bill. Breeding male is distinctive, with bright yellow overall plumage and a black-and-chestnut bib. Females and non-breeding males are much duller, but show streaking on the back and usually a pale base to the dark bill. Found in a small range in central Tanzania, in reedbeds along rivers, often in flocks. Nests colonially. Plumages other than the breeding male’s can be hard to separate from other weavers, especially Vitelline Masked-Weaver, but can be cautiously identified by their dark back, by their less yellow overall coloration, and by range. Vocalizations are typical of weavers: “chek” notes and a sizzling “radio static” song."
0,Kimberley Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Territornis fordiana,https://ebird.org/species/kimhon1,"Medium-sized honeyeater found in sandstone escarpment and gorge country of the western Kimberley region. Upperparts uniformly gray-green, underparts pale with diffuse gray streaks on chest. Dark cheeks split by thin pale gape mark that extends upward under the blue eye. Calls include loud short whistled phrases."
0,King Eider,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Somateria spectabilis,https://ebird.org/species/kineid,"A fantastic sea duck of the high Arctic. Breeding male is particularly shocking, as if you left a child unsupervised with a set of paints; it would be very difficult to mistake this bird for anything else. At a distance, look for black back with “sails” sticking up, powdery-blue nape, and enormous orange knob on the face. Immature male is variable but usually dark brown or blackish overall with paler breast and orange bill. Female is buffy-brown with a blackish bill shaped to look like she’s smiling. Extensive breeding range across the Arctic tundra; winters at slightly lower latitudes, rarely as far south as the mid-Atlantic states of the U.S. Most often seen singly or in small flocks on the ocean, often mixed with Common Eider or other sea ducks. Rare on inland lakes, but more regular inland than Common Eider. Females and young males more regularly seen further south than adult males."
0,King Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Aptenodytes patagonicus,https://ebird.org/species/kinpen1,"Large, spectacular, and basically unmistakable penguin that is rarely seen away from well-known colony sites. The long and stout bill distinguishes King from the even larger but shorter-billed Emperor Penguin, which is a true Antarctic species, rarely seen far from ice. Also note the golden neck patches (can fade to whitish on immatures) and pink bill base (bill starts out black on immature). Breeding season requires more than a year, so birds can be seen year-round at colonies."
0,King Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus elegans,https://ebird.org/species/kinrai4,"Large, bright rail of freshwater marshes. Generally uncommon to rare across range. Note rich orange neck and face, contrasty black-and-white barring on sides, and rich brownish upperparts with distinct dark streaks. Females are duller than males. Very similar to Clapper Rail, especially on the Gulf Coast. Habitat is a good first clue: King prefers freshwater marshes with extensive cattails or other reeds; rarely found in brackish or saltwater marshes like Clapper. King is also brighter overall with more contrasting pattern on the sides and upperparts. Beware that King and Clapper can hybridize where fresh and saltwater meet; some birds are best left unidentified. Listen for series of harsh ""kek"" notes or loud, rasping grunts erupting from marsh, slower and deeper than Clapper Rail."
0,King Vulture,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cathartiformes,Cathartidae,Sarcoramphus papa,https://ebird.org/species/kinvul1,"Uncommon, large, and spectacular bird of lowland tropical forest, mainly in wilder areas and not around human habitation. Most often seen soaring overhead in mid-late morning, often fairly high up with kettles of Black Vultures; rarely seen perched. Striking adult has a colorful head and neck, piercing white eyes, and mostly white plumage with a black trailing edge to the wings and tail. Immature is blackish overall and lacks the white wing markings of the smaller Black Vulture. Immature develops adult plumage over a few years with white appearing first on the belly and the underside of the wings."
0,Kinglet Calyptura,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Calyptura cristata,https://ebird.org/species/kincal1,"One of Earth’s rarest and most sought-after birds. It inhabits humid forest in the coastal mountains of southeastern Brazil, and may now be extinct. Apart from a series of sightings in October 1996 near Teresópolis in the state of Rio de Janeiro, this tiny and colorful bird has not been reliably documented since the 1800s. Recent unverified reports have also come from other areas in the coastal range in the neighboring state of São Paulo. Plumage is mostly yellowish-olive, with a fiery red crest bordered by a black stripe, and white wingbars. Other features include a very short bill, white tips to the inner wing feathers, and a yellow rump that is usually hidden by the wings. The few living observers have reported that it tended to perch in treetops with a notably vertical posture. Its voice is unknown."
0,Kinglet Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Machaeropterus regulus,https://ebird.org/species/strman2,"Chunky little, short-tailed bird of lowland and foothill forest. Male is distinctive with bright red crown and bold white stripes on reddish belly. Female lacks red crown but shows faint streaking on sides unlike any other manakin. Inconspicuous; elaborate display dance infrequently seen. Found in the lower to middle levels of forest. Listen for its strong “chew” call."
0,Kioea,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mohoidae,Chaetoptila angustipluma,https://ebird.org/species/kioea,"Extinct, last reported in 1900."
0,Kirtland's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga kirtlandii,https://ebird.org/species/kirwar,"One of the largest and rarest warblers. Breeds only in young jack pine forests in northern Michigan and Wisconsin. Winters in the Bahamas; seldom seen in migration. Blue-gray above and lemon-yellow below with broken white eye-ring, thin white wingbars, and black spotting on sides. Female slightly browner than male. Constantly pumps tail up and down. Most similar to drab female or immature Magnolia Warbler but larger with gray (not greenish) back and tail-pumping behavior. Also compare with Canada Warbler, which has bold black streaks across breast and bold yellow spectacles."
0,Kittlitz's Murrelet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Brachyramphus brevirostris,https://ebird.org/species/kitmur,"Small, oblong-shaped seabird. Breeding plumage mottled brown; darkness varies, but often shows golden tint. Nonbreeding plumage dark gray above and white below, with a white face and large white wing patch. Nests in crevices in rocky scree slopes, particularly around glaciers; forages in coastal glacial outflows. Similar to Marbled and Long-billed Murrelets, but with shorter bill and white outer tail feathers; breeding birds average paler with speckled back, while nonbreeders show white on face extending above the eye."
0,Kittlitz's Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius pecuarius,https://ebird.org/species/kitplo1,"Small plover with a brown back and pale underparts. Distinctive head pattern, with one black stripe behind the eye and another across the forehead. Found on mudflats, on saltpans, and in open fields, sometimes far from water. Generally most common along the coast, though locally common inland. Acts like a typical plover, running and plucking food from the ground. Bold head pattern and lack of chest bands separate adults from other plovers. Plainer juveniles can be confusing, but are smaller than White-fronted and Caspian Plovers."
0,Klaas's Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Chrysococcyx klaas,https://ebird.org/species/klacuc1,"A small, greenish cuckoo. The male has plain white underparts and glossy green upperparts; note dark spurs that extend from the head down onto the lower throat, as well as conspicuous white patch behind the eye. The female is barred with greenish-bronze on the back; her head is gray-brown; and her underparts are barred brown-and-white. It eats caterpillars and larvae, and its preferred brood-parasite hosts are batises, small warblers, and sunbirds. A fairly common resident and migrant, it is much more conspicuous when incessantly repeating its plaintive “meeee-jtie, meeee-tjie” call."
0,Klages's Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Drymophila klagesi,https://ebird.org/species/klaant2,"Stunning small bird with long, white-tipped tail. Head, back and breast streaked black-and-white in male; female also streaked but back and crown are rufous. Both sexes show rufous rump and belly. Wings have contrasting white spots and wingbars. Often in pairs in bamboo thickets or at edges of montane forest. Hard to see but easy to hear, raspy song starting with two strong peeps followed by two or three longer, wheezy notes. No similar species in range."
0,Klages's Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula klagesi,https://ebird.org/species/klaant1,"Tiny, compact antwren with a short tail. Males are gray and heavily streaked black. Females are similar but have an ochraceous tinge. Found in the canopy of seasonally flooded forests and on forested river islands. The song is a repetition of double notes: “teWic.” The male of Amazonian Streaked Antwren is rather similar but has a semi-concealed white back patch."
0,Kloss's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus ogilviegranti,https://ebird.org/species/klolew1,"Unlike “Blyth’s-type” leaf warblers, the similarly-sized but somewhat stouter Kloss’s and Davison’s leaf warblers flick both of their wings at the same time. A brightly-marked leaf warbler with a yolk-yellow brow and crown stripe, and a pale-yellow vent which contrasts with the white breast and belly. Wing bars are also yellow and average stronger than those of Claudia’s, Blyth’s, and Hartert’s warblers. Yellow vent and strong crown stripe may cause confusion with Eastern Crowned Warbler when the latter is migrating, but look for the relatively small, stubby bill and the strong double wing bars of Kloss’s."
0,Knobbed Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Rhyticeros cassidix,https://ebird.org/species/knohor1,"A huge black hornbill with a prominent knob on the bill, conspicuous red “gills” on the sides of the beak, a turquoise-blue throat pouch, and a white tail. Males have a red casque and rufous neck, females a yellow knob and black neck. Juveniles resemble male, but with an entirely yellow casqueless bill. Found in pairs or groups in canopy of forested and wooded areas of lowlands and hills. Larger and more colorful than Sulawesi Hornbill. Gives powerful, short “krok” notes and a more drawn-out “oooo-aa-ooo-aaa.”"
0,Knysna Turaco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Musophagiformes,Musophagidae,Tauraco corythaix,https://ebird.org/species/knytur1,"A long-tailed, bulky, green bird that bounces agilely through evergreen forest canopies in pairs or small groups. In flight it explodes from the canopy with distinctive deep red panels in the wings. A harsh repeated, croaking “khaaar-khaaar-khaar” often reveals its presence. Knysna Turaco has a rounded, white tipped crest, unlike the pointed crest of the similar Livingstone’s Turaco. Purple-crested Turaco is much darker on the body."
0,Knysna Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus sylvaticus,https://ebird.org/species/knswar1,"A skulky, dark olive-brown warbler with a graduated tail and plain dark underparts (sometimes with fine streaking). It creeps around mouse-like in thick undergrowth and tangles in forest, forest edge, and coastal thickets. It is frequently detected and identified by its song, mostly delivered between August and November, which comprises a series of accelerating “tslip” notes that culminate in a reedy trill. The similar Barratt’s Warbler differs from Knysna Warbler by its longer tail, paler underparts, more pronounced throat streaking, and different song."
0,Knysna Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campethera notata,https://ebird.org/species/knywoo1,"A furtive woodpecker with densely spotted underparts and face. The male has a reddish crown and moustache; the female has a faint dark moustache and dark crown marked red only toward the back of the head. Pairs inhabit forest, forest edge, thickets, and plantations, moving slowly and deliberately while foraging for insects. Often prefers smaller branches in thick scrub where it remains well hidden, infrequently giving a distinctive shrill single note “pleeiiee.” Does not drum."

Underparts are pale, with diffuse tawny streaks on the breast. The tail is tricolored, mostly blackish with golden-rufous central feathers and white outer feathers, conspicuous in flight. Movements are poorly known, but small groups are partial migrants and nomads in scrubby semi-desert on reddish sands with grass. Vocalizations are poorly known, but one recording suggests varied whistles, churrs, and tweets, including imitations, and an aerial display. Kordofan is easily confused with the very similar Dunn’s Lark, which is paler, lacks breast streaking, and has a uniform pinkish horn-colored bill."
0,Kordofan Rufous Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer cordofanicus,https://ebird.org/species/korspa1,"A typical sparrow with a striped back, a gray crown and back of the neck, and a dark bib. There is rufous on the eye stripe, back, and rump. The sexes are similar, though males are brighter overall and show a blacker and more distinct bib. Found locally in dry thorn savanna and cultivated areas, sometimes around human habitation. Similar to House Sparrow, but easily separated by the bright rufous in the plumage. The call is a cheerful “chirp,” similar to that of other sparrows."

Typical puffbird shape: rotund with a large flat head and thick hooked bill. Brown above and white below with heavy blackish streaking. Unlikely to be mistaken. Easy to overlook as it perches quietly, often around a clearing or edge within forest. Usually single or in pairs, occasionally associating with a mixed-species flock. Listen for rising whistled calls."
0,Lanceolated Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella lanceolata,https://ebird.org/species/lanwar,"Small, compact brown warbler with distinct black streaking all over the body. Note evenly spaced narrow pale fringes to the tertials in adults and juveniles. Very hard to see when not singing, but when located can be very confiding. Breeds in swampy open forests, reedbeds, and swampy edges across the taiga; winters in similarly tangled and densely vegetated habitat. Song is a long insectlike trill which ascends then descends as the bird moves its head; can be difficult to pin down. Calls from cover, giving a dry, incessant “chit-chit-chit-chit”."
0,Lanner Falcon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco biarmicus,https://ebird.org/species/lanfal1,"Large and powerful falcon; slightly smaller and more slender than Saker Falcon. Several subspecies breed in the region. Adults are grayer above than Saker and have a paler cap. Juveniles are extremely similar to Saker and Peregrine Falcons. Compared to Saker juvenile Lanner Falcons have unstreaked trousers. Compared to Peregrine, juvenile Lanners are more heavily streaked on the underwings and underparts. Often hunts pigeons in canyons. Breeds on high mountainous cliffs in desert, semi-desert, and Mediterranean climates. In winter often descends to plains and steppes. Call is a typical falcon scream."
0,Lapland Longspur,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Calcariidae,Calcarius lapponicus,https://ebird.org/species/laplon,"Sparrowlike ground-dweller; crouches low to the ground and walks with pattering footsteps. Breeding male is gorgeous and unmistakable: yellow bill, black face, broad white eyebrow, and bright rufous nape unlike any other bird. Females and nonbreeding birds are much more subtle. Habitat and habits provide good clues: often in flocks in winter, sometimes mixed with Horned Larks or Snow Buntings, on barren landscapes such as beaches or dirt fields. To separate from other longspurs, look for combination of face pattern, rufous nape, and rufous wing panel with white tips. Breeds on Arctic tundra, where males sing a tinkling warble. Can also be heard giving ""teew"" notes and rattle calls like Snow Buntings and other longspurs."
0,Large Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis magnirostris,https://ebird.org/species/larblf1,"Typical blue flycatcher; male is bright blue above and orange below, while female is grayish-brown above with a light orange suffusion on her pale belly. Breeds in eastern Himalayan foothill forests and winters in more open habitat in lowlands of Thai-Malay peninsula. Combination of orange throat, long broad bill, and extensive orange on underparts (stretching from the throat down to the belly) serve to distinguish male from other similar species. Dull female is lighter-colored and has a paler throat than similar Chinese Blue-Flycatcher. Closely related Hill Blue Flycatcher is extremely similar and identification may be safer when based on range; visually, look for Large Blue’s slightly larger bill with a more pronounced hooked tip, paler throat in relation to the chest, and paler pinkish legs. Gives a high, sweet song with harsh rattling notes interspersed; averages longer than similar song of Hill Blue Flycatcher."
0,Large Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina macei,https://ebird.org/species/larcus1,"A large gray cuckooshrike with a strong, hooked bill.

Male has gray throat and upper breast becoming white in the belly with some gray bars. Female has white underparts with dark gray bars except from the lower belly to the tail. Both sexes have a dark patch from the bill to slightly behind the eye, giving a masked impression. Juvenile is brownish, heavily scaled with whitish-buff, and mottled on the underparts. Immature has broader white edges to wing feathers. Vocal. Call is a two-noted, rather nasal “gii-yaak,” uttered in flight as well as from a perch. Inhabits lightly wooded country, avoiding wet forests."
0,Large Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia spectabilis,https://ebird.org/species/larela1,"Medium-sized migratory flycatcher found at forest edges, in second growth, and along streams. As with other elaenia species, it has an olive-brown back and yellowish belly. Note the three wingbars and short crest. Very similar to Yellow-bellied Elaenia, but it is larger and has smaller crest with no white and three (not two) wingbars. The song is a loud whistle while the dawn song is series of “twee-wee-tweet” notes."
0,Large Fig-Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Psittaculirostris desmarestii,https://ebird.org/species/lafpar1,"A medium-sized, chunky parrot of forest from the lowlands to the mid-mountains. Reddish forehead, orange crown, yellow cheek and blue or purple band across the chest. Races differ and considered separate species by some. Similar-sized Edward’s & Salvadori’s Fig-Parrots not thought to co-occur, but Large Fig-Parrot has an orange rather than green crown. Somewhat similar to Double-eyed Fig-Parrot, but Large Fig-Parrot is larger and has yellow-orange cheek and a breast band. Fairly vocal.

0,Large Ground-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Geospiza magnirostris,https://ebird.org/species/lagfin1,"A large Galápagos finch with a bulky bill. Bill typically appears bulbous, showing a ridge along the upper edge that juts up where it meets the crown feathers. Bill is black on breeding male and dull orange on female and nonbreeding male. Adult male’s plumage is sooty-black; female is brown with paler underparts that are streaked with gray. Medium Ground-Finch has smaller, shallower bill lacking ridge along the top. However, bill size varies among individuals, and not all birds can be confidently identified. Common in arid habitats near the coast, and scarce in the highlands. Found on most islands, but absent from Baltra, Santa Fé, San Cristóbal, Española, Darwin, and Wolf. Formerly occurred on Floreana, but there are no recent records."
0,Large Niltava,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Niltava grandis,https://ebird.org/species/larnil1,"Typical niltava: male bright blue, female plain brown. Male is bright electric purplish-blue above and very dark blue below. Female is dark brown with rusty tones in the wings and an iridescent blue patch on the neck. Southeast Asian females have a pale powder-blue crown and nape. Lack of a bright white throat patch separates female from female Rufous-bellied and Fujian Niltavas. Small Niltava is similar in plumage, but much smaller and less heavyset. Male White-tailed Robin can be surprisingly similar but is proportionally smaller-headed and larger-bodied and has a wider tail with two bright white patches on it. Inhabits dense submontane forests, where it can be difficult to spot in dense foliage; often encountered making forays from a perch.

0,Large Tree-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Camarhynchus psittacula,https://ebird.org/species/latfin1,"A fairly large, parrot-billed Galápagos finch. Bill is highly curved on both the upper and lower edges, and it is a bit longer than it is deep. Male has a black head and back, and a yellowish belly with a varying amount of dark streaking. Female is tan with a whitish or yellowish belly, and brown streaks on the underparts. Bill is black on breeding male, and brown or orange on nonbreeding male and female. Very similar to Vegetarian Finch, which is larger with a bulkier bill. On Floreana, also compare with Medium Tree-Finch. Found on most of the larger islands, but absent from Española, Genovesa, Santiago, and San Cristóbal. Inhabits forests at higher elevations, but some may descend to lower elevations during dry periods."
0,Large Woodshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Tephrodornis virgatus,https://ebird.org/species/larwoo1,"Nondescript large-billed bird with a bandit’s mask. Very similar to Common Woodshrike, but note heavier bill and lack of white eyebrow. A species of lowland and hill forests. Forages slowly and quietly, often in upper levels of forest and frequently with mixed-species flocks. Song is a rapid monotone series of whistles, the first one or two notes sometimes lower. Also frequently gives a harsh rattling call."
0,Lark Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Calamospiza melanocorys,https://ebird.org/species/larbun,"Chunky, thick-billed sparrow that prefers wide open habitats. Breeding males are unmistakable: mostly jet black with a bold white wing patch. Nonbreeding males and females are overall streaky brown, but still show white wing patch.

Roams around on the ground of interior rainforests at low to middle elevations. Very shy and difficult to see well. Similar to Nahan’s Francolin, but separated by the dark bill, the lack of red bare facial skin, and the yellow rather than red legs. Most often detected by vocalizations, which include a bubbly descending series and a duet of nasal notes and repeated, descending phrases."
0,Latham's Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago hardwickii,https://ebird.org/species/latsni1,"Long-billed skulking shorebird of muddy edges in freshwater wetlands. Breeds in Japan and spends the nonbreeding season mainly in eastern Australia. When disturbed it erupts from cover with loud ""chek"" call and zig-zags away in flight. Can be extremely hard to identify from other Australian snipes (Pin-tailed and Swinhoe's); when possible focus on length of toes trailing behind tail in flight (Latham's has almost no toes projecting behind tail)."
0,Laughing Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Streptopelia senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/laudov1,"Small, similar in size to European Turtle-Dove.

Occurs throughout much of North and South America, where it can be found in marshes with a mix of open water and vegetation, often with cattails, phragmites, or lily pads. Usually seen perched motionlessly, straddling reeds at the edge of water. Occasionally makes short flights just above the reeds. Listen for the soft cooing song, given during the day and at night."
0,Least Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax minimus,https://ebird.org/species/leafly,"Small, grayish-olive flycatcher; very similar to several other species. Look for relatively bold white eyeing, small bill, and frequent wing flicking. Most easily identified by voice: song is a loud “che-BEK, che-BEK” often repeated in bursts. Also gives a short, dry “whit” call. Found in a variety of wooded or shrubby habitats, often near water during breeding season. Typically solitary, often flitting around actively when foraging."
0,Least Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Tachybaptus dominicus,https://ebird.org/species/leagre,"This wee little grebe is dark gray overall with paler fluffy bum. The face is dark in breeding plumage; paler with a whitish throat in nonbreeding plumage. Also note piercing yellow eye and thin, sharply pointed bill. Compare with Pied-billed Grebe, which is larger, browner, and thicker-billed. Widespread throughout Middle and South America; very limited range in the U.S. Found in marshy ponds, often with extensive vegetation. Usually seen singly or in pairs, sometimes in small groups. Frequently dives underwater."
0,Least Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator exilis,https://ebird.org/species/leahon2,"Small, dark olive-green honeyguide. The face and underparts are dark gray, with a pale spot above the bill and a dark line below it. Sometimes shows strong streaking on the back and lower flanks. In flight, shows white patches on the sides of the tail. Found in forest and tree plantations. The main call is a slowly repeated “chreeya.” Similar to Lesser and Thick-billed Honeyguides, but smaller, and further distinguished from Thick-billed by the facial markings. Also similar to Pallid Honeyguide, but has a larger bill, and a darker and more patterned head. Similar to Wahlberg’s and Green-backed Honeyguides, but has a thicker bill."
0,Least Nighthawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Chordeiles pusillus,https://ebird.org/species/leanig1,"Small nightjar of savannas and dry forests, where it forages for insects with characteristic erratic flight like other nighthawks. Key field mark is contrasting pale trailing edge of wings. Often seen in large groups at dusk; when foraging with other species, Least is noticeably smaller. Least Nighthawks and related nighthawks are told from other nightjars by active foraging behavior. Roosts during the day on ground or in small savanna trees."
0,Least Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris minutilla,https://ebird.org/species/leasan,"Tiny brownish sandpiper. At all ages, most easily distinguished from other small sandpipers by darker, more brownish coloration. Juveniles are particularly bright with rusty tones on the upperparts. Also note fine-tipped bill and yellowish legs, but beware legs can be covered with dark mud and other peeps (like Semipalmated Sandpiper) can rarely show slightly greenish legs. Habitat and behavior are helpful supporting clues, too. Typically forages in a crouched posture with bent legs, picking for invertebrates in the mud. Often in small loose groups, but not in large, tight flocks like Semipalmated or Western Sandpipers. Prefers drier mud, often on the higher edges of mudflats or small patches of water in marshes. Widespread and common, especially inland. Breeds in various wetland habitats throughout Alaska and Canada. Winters from the southern U.S. to South America. Listen for high-pitched, rolling “greeep!” calls."
0,Least Seedsnipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Thinocoridae,Thinocorus rumicivorus,https://ebird.org/species/leasee1,"Very small but stocky, quail-like bird of Patagonian steppe, sandy and stony plains in the Andes, coastal dunes, and deserts. Found in pairs or small groups; locally large flocks in nonbreeding season. Male has hooting song given from low mounds or fence posts, and sometimes during display flight. Flight is strong and fast; flushes with loud bleating chatters. Similar Gray-breasted Seedsnipe is larger, favors rockier Andean habitats, and has plain gray breast without diagnostic black Y pattern present on male Least Seedsnipes."
0,Least Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates microsoma,https://ebird.org/species/lsspet,"Very small, all-dark storm-petrel with a fairly short, graduated tail. Fairly common and can be seen from shore in the Gulf of California and along the Pacific coast. Often feeds and associates with the much larger Black Storm-Petrel, where size difference is obvious. Flight of Least is generally quick and weaving, with deep, rather jerky wingbeats and little or no gliding."
0,Least Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sternula antillarum,https://ebird.org/species/leater1,"Tiny tern with quick flicking wingbeats. A real beach bum, rarely straying far from sand, both on the coast and along inland rivers and lakes. Breeding adults have yellow bill, stumpy yellow feet, white forehead, and black cap. Nonbreeding and immatures have a black bill, blackish nape, and dark shoulder bar, but still always identifiable by size and quick wingbeats. Often seen with other terns. Listen for shrill high-pitched calls."
0,Lemon Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba larvata,https://ebird.org/species/lemdov2,"Dark, medium-sized dove with a pale face. Shows paler gray corners of the tail in flight. Varies geographically; most eastern and southern African birds have rufous underparts, while western and central African birds are gray below. Shy understory species that is most often seen on the ground inside thick forest. Often not noticed until it noisily flies away. Call is a deep hoot, usually delivered in a slow series, though sometimes in a quick series. Similar to Delegorgue’s and Bronze-naped pigeons but inhabits the understory and has a pale face."
0,Lesser Antillean Bullfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Loxigilla noctis,https://ebird.org/species/leabul1,"A tame and often conspicuous resident of thickets and tangles in a wide variety of habitats. Males are black with a red throat and vent, and females are buff and gray with rust on the wings and vent. The male is similar to the St. Lucia Black Finch, which has pale legs rather than black and lacks the Lesser Antillean Bullfinch’s red throat and vent. The female could be mistaken for a St. Lucia Black Finch or a female Black-faced Grassquit. The female black finch has a gray rather than brown crown and has pale (not dark) legs. Female grassquits are olive, not brown above and are smaller. The typical song is a series of three to seven “wheet” notes. Common calls include “chuk” and “tseet.”"
0,Lesser Antillean Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiarchus oberi,https://ebird.org/species/leafly1,"An inconspicuous, relatively tame, medium-sized flycatcher of woodlands and tall scrub. Typically perches motionless below the canopy of the tree before sallying forth in pursuit of prey. Distinguished from similar species within its range by combination of gray chest, yellow belly, and rust-brown undertail. Often first detected by its plaintive, drawn out “pheee” or “pheeuuu” song. Also makes a variety of “pip” and rolling trill calls."
0,Lesser Antillean Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus latirostris,https://ebird.org/species/leapew1,"A small drab flycatcher of woodlands including, at times, mangrove swamps. This species is dull brown above and yellow-buff to orange-buff below. Adults lack wingbars and eyering, but immatures have dull buff wingbars. The tertial edges are typically quite bright, forming narrow stripes on the posterior folded wing. The Caribbean Elaenia is passingly similar but has bold wingbars and a gray eyebrow. Vocalizations include a whistled “peee-oo” followed by a low whistled trill and “pee-ooooo,” with the first syllable a clear whistle and the second a low-whistled trill. Also, commonly utters a sharp “pee.”"
0,Lesser Antillean Saltator,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Saltator albicollis,https://ebird.org/species/leasal1,"A small to medium-sized, olive-colored inhabitant of thickets, scrub, and other low dense habitats. A distinctive species with a stout black-and-yellow bill, a pale throat, and a pale eyebrow. No similar species occur within its range. Its song is a series of loud musical notes that rise and fall. Call notes include faint “tsi” and sharp “chink.”"
0,Lesser Antillean Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Chaetura martinica,https://ebird.org/species/leaswi1,"An aerial feeder that is typically found over highland forests in flocks of up to forty birds; sometimes feeds at lower altitudes, particularly during inclement weather. Its stubby dark-gray body and rapid, shallow wingbeats eliminates all swallows. Short-tailed Swift is similar, but has a gray vent and gray rump, which contrasts more markedly against its dark body than Lesser Antillean Swift. Very rarely found when not flying. Call is a high, sharp twitter."
0,Lesser Antillean Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Stilpnia cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/leatan1,"A brightly colored small woodland species often found in pairs or small flocks at fruiting trees.

0,Lesser Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus bengalensis,https://ebird.org/species/lescou1,"A dark, rather sturdy cuckoo of scrubby habitats, reedbeds, forest edge, and agricultural areas. Adults black with bright chestnut wings and fine silvery streaking on neck and shoulders. Immatures a grayish brown above, paler below, with dull chestnut wings and a brown-and-black barred tail. Similar to Greater Coucal but significantly smaller, with a dark (instead of red) eye and duller chestnut back and wings with silver streaks. Song is a distinctive series of sharp notes, with the crescendo cadence of a bouncing ball."
0,Lesser Crested Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Thalasseus bengalensis,https://ebird.org/species/lecter2,"Elegant medium-sized tern with a slender yellow-orange bill and black crown. Can be confused with Great Crested Tern; note proportionally longer, more orangey bill on Lesser Crested. Also note gray upperwing, which separates it from Sandwich Tern. Gray rump and tail are diagnostic if seen well. On juveniles, note dull legs, secondaries with dark centers, and a weakly patterned upperwing. Strictly coastal, usually found on beaches and estuaries. Call a noisy “kerrrick.”"
0,Lesser Ground-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Morococcyx erythropygus,https://ebird.org/species/legcuc1,"Furtive and rarely seen, but loud song carries well and sounds like a referee’s whistle being blown faster and then slower. Inhabits brushy dry woodland in tropical lowlands, where most of the time it walks stealthily on the ground. When alarmed it usually freezes offering good views—if you are lucky. Note the boldly colored turquoise and yellow skin around the eye and the warm buffy or cinnamon-colored underparts."
0,Lesser Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Lalage fimbriata,https://ebird.org/species/lescus1,"Medium-sized gray bird (small for a cuckooshrike) with considerable geographic variation. Male averages darkest on the wings, throat, and breast, contrasting more heavily with the rest of the plumage than in the fairly uniform-looking male Indochinese Cuckooshrike. Female is pale gray with fine barring on the underparts. Undertail is black with white-tipped feathers concentrated at the end of the tail; does not appear as evenly graduated as in the larger Black-winged Cuckooshrike, and is less extensively white-tailed than Indochinese Cuckooshrike. Forages in the upper levels of forests and forest edge in lowland and hilly areas, often as part of mixed-species flocks. Song begins with a few clear tinkling notes, then transitions into a loud, insistent “jeh, jeh, jeh, jeh”."
0,Lesser Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia chiriquensis,https://ebird.org/species/lesela1,"Confusing flycatcher, fairly small and nondescript. Like many other elaenias and flycatchers, brownish-olive above, pale gray on the throat, and pale yellow on the belly, with whitish wingbars. Only shows a slight crest and very little facial pattern. Usually seen in more open habitats like forest edge or second growth, singly or in pairs, sometimes following a mixed-species flock. Best identified by voice, which varies across range. Call is typically a single high-pitched “pseew”, sometimes buzzy and sometimes clear. Also gives a harsh stuttered song, varying from a short “chi-bur” to a longer series of notes."
0,Lesser Fish-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Haliaeetus humilis,https://ebird.org/species/lefeag1,"Gray-brown eagle with piercing yellow eyes and an immaculate white belly. Juvenile paler and browner than adult, with weakly streaked underparts. Most easily separated from larger Gray-headed Fish-Eagle in flight: note Lesser’s “dirtier” tail with a less contrasting black band and more mottled underwings in adult; note overall paler underside patterning in juvenile. White belly also tends to have a more poorly-defined and jagged shape than the sharp “V” of Gray-headed. Favors faster-flowing foothill streams and rivers, but can also be found in lowland lakes and wetlands."
0,Lesser Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoeniconaias minor,https://ebird.org/species/lesfla1,The smallest flamingo in the world with a long and very dark tricolored bill and red legs.

Makes extensive movements in response to changing environmental conditions.
0,Lesser Florican,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Sypheotides indicus,https://ebird.org/species/lesflo2,"Small and gracile bustard of grasslands, scrubby fields, and select agricultural matrices. Male is striking: black with pale wings and a filamentous crest. Light brown female is less eye-catching, but her size and shape set her apart from other similar species. Difficult to detect in tall vegetation; male’s crazy courtship dance puts him in view during the breeding season."
0,Lesser Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata ariel,https://ebird.org/species/lesfri,"The smallest of the frigatebirds, but note that the female is larger than the male. Adults are easier to identify than younger birds. Adult males are almost entirely black with a red throat and white spurs emanating outwards from the body onto the wing. Adult females have a black belly and throat, a white breast and hind collar, with similar white spurs on their sides. Juvenile and immature plumages are variable and are best separated from other frigatebirds by size when comparison is possible. Mostly silent except while breeding in oceanic islands. Strongly pelagic during non-breeding season but wind-blown or fatigued birds can be found from continental coasts."
0,Lesser Goldfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Spinus psaltria,https://ebird.org/species/lesgol,"Tiny yellowish finch. Blackish conical bill is stout, but sharply pointed. Long wings are black with one white wingbar and large white patch at the base of the primaries. Small head. Short notched tail. Adult males have either green or black (Texas to South America) back. Regularly visits feeders. Females similar to American Goldfinch; note bill shape and color, usually more yellowish undertail coverts, less distinct wingbars, and more obvious white patch at base of primaries."
0,Lesser Grass-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Emberizoides ypiranganus,https://ebird.org/species/lesgrf1,Large finch with a long spiky tail and strong yellow bill. It is yellow-brown above with dark lines running down the back and pale buff below with a gray face and a white throat. Differs from Wedge-tailed Grass-finch in having a white rather than buff throat. Usually found in marshes and humid grasslands. The song is a harsh “ch-ch-ch-ch.”
0,Lesser Green Leafbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chloropseidae,Chloropsis cyanopogon,https://ebird.org/species/leglea1,"Male and females are bright green overall, but the male has a black-and-blue throat while the female sometimes shows a slight yellow tinge to the throat. The Lesser Green Leafbird is very similar in appearance to the Greater Green Leafbird, but note that the male Lesser Green Leafbird has a smaller black mask and traces of yellow on the forehead. Lack of blue traces in the wings distinguishes this species from the otherwise similar Blue-winged and Bornean Leafbirds. Inhabits lowland primary and secondary broadleaf evergreen forests, as well as adjacent plantations and large parks. Joins mixed-species foraging flocks, usually in the canopy."
0,Lesser Greenlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Pachysylvia decurtata,https://ebird.org/species/lesgre1,"Small plain vireo of tropical forest and woodland in lowlands. Usually stays fairly high in trees and likely to be overlooked unless its rather tuneless, monotonously repeated song is learned. Identified by a combination its gray head (in Mexico and Central America) with a diffuse whitish eyering; whitish underparts with a yellowish wash on the sides; and plain olive upperparts. Head of birds from eastern Panama to South America is olive, with a whitish eyering."

0,Lesser Ground-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Amalocichla incerta,https://ebird.org/species/legrob1,"A fairly small, long-legged bird of montane forest floor. Brown above with rufous edges to the flight feathers, buffy chest, white throat, and white spot behind the bill. Same general shape and habits as the Greater Ground-Robin, but Lesser occurs at lower elevations and is much smaller. Heard more often than seen. Song, a series of whistled notes, either rising, falling or the same pitch."
0,Lesser Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator minor,https://ebird.org/species/leshon1,"A small, inconspicuous, gray-green bird with striking white outer tail feathers that are evident in undulating flight. It is easily confused with other honeyguides, but a pale spot on the top of the bill and subtle, darker (moustachial) streaks on either side of the throat are characteristic. Often it is the commonest honeyguide in mixed woodland, cultivation, and pasture; it can be tracked down by following its continuous, strident “swiiit, swiiit, swiiit” calls. Thick-billed Honeyguide (not recognized by some taxonomies) is almost identical, but it is darker in coloration and prefers closed-canopy forest. The smaller Least Honeyguide is often more heavily streaked underneath, and Pallid Honeyguide has a plainer face and indistinct moustachial streaks; both have differing vocaliations."
0,Lesser Hornero,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Furnarius minor,https://ebird.org/species/leshor1,"The smallest hornero. Plumage rusty overall with a white eyebrow, a gray crown, and a white throat. Note the gray legs. Found in scrub on river islands and occasionally in human-modified habitats near major rivers. Forages walking on the ground, especially at the water’s edge. The song is a series of fast staccato “kee” notes, usually given in duet. Other horneros with overlapping distributions have longer and louder songs."
0,Lesser Jacana,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Jacanidae,Microparra capensis,https://ebird.org/species/lesjac1,"Very small and generally uncommon jacana. Adults show rufous on the crown, breast sides, rump, and tail. Juveniles are duller. Most distinctive in flight, when the white trailing edge to the wing is revealed. Found in thickly vegetated wetlands, especially those with waterlilies. Seems to move around in response to changing water levels. Call is a quick, hooting series. Often confused with immature African Jacana, but smaller and with a shorter bill that never shows any blue. Easily separated in flight by the white stripe at the back of the wing and the pale patches on top of the wing."
0,Lesser Kestrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco naumanni,https://ebird.org/species/leskes1,Shape very similar to Eurasian Kestrel but tail slightly shorter and central tail feathers project slightly. Wings more rounded and shorter than Eurasian Kestrel; claws are white rather than black. Males are unspotted above with blue-gray patches on the upperwings and largely pale underwings. Females have an indistinct mustache but otherwise are rather similar to Eurasian Kestrel. Hovers frequently and catches insects on the wing. Breeds colonially.
0,Lesser Kiskadee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Pitangus lictor,https://ebird.org/species/leskis1,"This flycatcher is brown above and bright yellow below with a black-and-white head pattern; very similar in plumage to a host of other species including Great Kiskadee and Rusty-margined Flycatcher. However, note Lesser Kiskadee’s smaller size, slender shape, and longer, narrower bill. Sexes alike. Found singly or in pairs, almost exclusively around slow-moving bodies of water in the lowlands of northern South America. Easy to find; tends to perch conspicuously often at eye level close to the water’s surface. Also listen for its slurred buzzy calls to help distinguish from similar species."

0,Lesser Lophorina,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Lophorina minor,https://ebird.org/species/lesbop1,"A fairly large bird of mid-montane forest. Male, mainly black plumage with 2 remarkable erectile fans which are lifted up over the head during its display. Metallic, blue-green, trapezium-shaped breast shield and patches above the eyes. Female has a dark brown back, barred underparts and a black head. Male is unmistakable. Female distinguished from Lawes’s Parotia female by slightly smaller size and black eye, and from female Magnificent Bird-of-Paradise by its black bill. The male’s yellow-green interior of the mouth is visible whilst it gives its piercing nasal screech."
0,Lesser Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus intermedius,https://ebird.org/species/lesmaw1,"A small, slender weaver with a whitish eye and distinctive slate-colored (not pinkish) legs. The male has a black mask that extends to the peak of the crown in breeding plumage. The female is nondescript but has a distinctive pale eye and white belly.

0,Lesser Moorhen,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Paragallinula angulata,https://ebird.org/species/lesmoo1,"Small, reclusive moorhen. Often confused with the much more common and extroverted Common Moorhen. Lesser Moorhen is smaller and has a narrower white streak along the side, a mostly yellow bill, and all-yellow legs. Immature is brownish--warmer brown than immature Common Moorhen--with a yellow bill. Found in wetlands, especially grassy, seasonally flooded ones. Shy and retiring. Calls a series of clucks or drier “chak” notes."
0,Lesser Necklaced Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Garrulax monileger,https://ebird.org/species/lenlau1,"A mid-sized laughingthrush, usually seen foraging on the ground and in shrubbery of hilly forest. Brown overall, with rusty highlights on the neck and flanks, and with prominent black markings on the white breast and face. Looks similar to the slightly larger Greater Necklaced Laughingthrush, with which it often associates in mixed flocks; Lesser differs in being duller rusty overall, having a complete (rather than partial) breast band, and having minimal streaking on the cheeks. Classic laughingthrush repertoire, with a beautiful fluty, meldic song and hooting calls."
0,Lesser Nighthawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Chordeiles acutipennis,https://ebird.org/species/lesnig,"Long-winged nocturnal bird which catches insects in flight often around dawn and dusk. Found in shrubby open areas. Intricate brown, buffy, and gray patterning with white patches near wingtips. Very similar to Common Nighthawk, best distinguished by the position of white wing patch: closer to wingtip on Lesser, closer to base of wing on Common, but this difference can be very difficult to judge. Also typically paler than Common with more golden buffy tones. During the day, roosts on the ground or on a tree branch."
0,Lesser Noddy,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Anous tenuirostris,https://ebird.org/species/lesnod1,"A small dark tern which appears grayish-black and extremely slender. Very similar to Black and Brown Noddies, but the Lesser Noddy has a very thin bill, is somewhat paler gray overall, and has gray between the bill and the eyes. The flight is fast and graceful, and it often mixes with other terns. Often found offshore, not far from islands in the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean."
0,Lesser Nothura,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothura minor,https://ebird.org/species/lesnot1,Sandy-colored tinamou that usually holds an upright posture. Has a brown crown and a heavily streaked back and throat. Occurs in grassland areas with scrub. The song is a series of metallic whistles: “peee peeeeee-peeep peeep peeep peeeeee.” The similar Spotted Nothura is larger and more rufescent and prefers areas with shorter grasses.
0,Lesser Prairie-Chicken,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tympanuchus pallidicinctus,https://ebird.org/species/lepchi,"Plump chickenlike bird found in grasslands. Body and wings entirely barred brown with paler buffy throat. In spring, males gather at display site and perform dance to attract females: look for them hunched over with ear-like feathers protruding from atop head and darker reddish-orange skin exposed on the neck. Inconspicuous and difficult to find away from display sites. Very similar to Greater Prairie-Chicken but no range overlap. Averages slightly paler and smaller than Greater."
0,Lesser Redpoll,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Acanthis cabaret,https://ebird.org/species/lesred1,"Fairly common in mixed and coniferous woodland and forest, especially with birch trees; also found in parks and gardens, and visits seed feeders. Often in flocks, mainly in autumn–winter; feeds especially on birch catkins, also on seeds on the ground. Rather warm brown and streaky overall with a small yellowish bill and deep red forehead patch (or ""poll"") and small black chin; male has bright pinkish-red blush to throat and breast. Compare with very similar Common Redpoll (identifying redpolls outside their breeding range is not always possible)."
0,Lesser Roadrunner,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Geococcyx velox,https://ebird.org/species/lesroa1,"Slightly smaller version of the familiar cartoon Greater Roadrunner, but usually the two species do not occur in the same places. Favors dry brushy woodland and overgrown weedy fields in tropical lowlands and foothills. Can be very elusive, but at other times runs out in the road or sits quietly sunning itself on a fence post or bush top in the early morning. Note that the center of the throat and breast are plain rich buffy, without the dense dark streaking of Greater Roadrunner."
0,Lesser Sand-Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius mongolus,https://ebird.org/species/lesplo,"Medium-sized plover with a pale throat, brown back, and white belly. Breeding adults have a black mask and a bright orange chest and neck; males average brighter than females. Non-breeding and immature birds are brownish above and white below, with white “eyebrows.” Subspecies vary slightly. Compare with slightly larger Greater Sand-Plover; Lesser is proportionally smaller-headed and darker-legged, and its shorter bill has a slight bulge at the tip. Smaller Kentish Plover can be similar in non-breeding plumage; Lesser is taller and longer-legged, without Kentish’s strong white neck band. Breeds on margins of high-elevation lakes and rivers, winters on coastal mudflats."

Also similar to Ring-necked Duck, but Lesser Scaup has grayer back and whiter sides. Usually in flocks or pairs on a variety of wetland habitats, from small ponds to large lakes and bays. Slightly more likely to be seen on smaller bodies of water, especially fresh water, than Greater Scaup, but much overlap. Frequently in mixed flocks with other Aythya ducks. Widespread across North America, with more southerly range extent than Greater Scaup, regularly reaching northern South America."
0,Lesser Seedcracker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Pyrenestes minor,https://ebird.org/species/lessee1,"A colorful, chunky waxbill with a large conical bill. Both sexes have a red hood and tail, but females have slightly less extensive red. Found in moist habitats with dense understory, including forest edge, areas along streams, and occasionally reedbeds. Scarce, shy, and inconspicuous. Somewhat similar to Red-headed Bluebill, but separated by many details, including the red tail. The calls include rough “drek” notes that may be given in a long, fast series."
0,Lesser Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx leucophris,https://ebird.org/species/lessho1,"A small ground-hugging bird found in areas with dense cover, usually near moving water. Unlike most shortwings, male and female are not significantly different; both sexes are brown or gray overall, with a white eyebrow and throat. Furtive and quite difficult to see; its tinkling melodic song, which starts with 1-2 slow notes and quickly accelerates into a rushed-sounding loud musical jumble, may give away its position in the undergrowth."
0,Lesser Spotted Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Clanga pomarina,https://ebird.org/species/leseag1,"Medium-sized, compact eagle. Adults are conspicuously two toned when perched: dark flight feathers contrast with paler body. Head and bill small for an eagle. Juveniles quite different, with bold white bars on the back, wings, and pale uppertail. Smaller and paler than the similar Greater Spotted Eagle. Look for the diagnostic double (not single) white ""commas"" on the wrist of the underwing. Normally found in open woodland or forest edges but can be found around low intensity farmland areas, sometimes perching prominently."
0,Lesser Spotted Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dryobates minor,https://ebird.org/species/leswoo1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common in deciduous woodland, parkland, larger gardens.

Note bold white barring on back and wings, whitish underparts with no red blush under tail; male has red crown patch."
0,Lesser Striped Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Cecropis abyssinica,https://ebird.org/species/lessts1,"A rather small, neat swallow with a distinctive burnt-orange skullcap extending onto the cheeks like a helmet, a rufous rump, and boldly streaked underparts. It is mostly resident in equatorial Africa, and a wet season breeding visitor to the northwest and southeast parts of its range. Pairs and small groups forage over grassland, woodland, and cultivation, generally at lower elevations than Greater Striped Swallow. The flight is fairly strong, much like that of a Barn Swallow. The larger Greater Striped Swallow is similar to Lesser Striped Swallow but with fewer and finer streaks, especially on the throat and ears, giving it a more open-faced appearance."
0,Lesser Swamp Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus gracilirostris,https://ebird.org/species/leswar1,"Nondescript, long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Varies geographically, with the back being olive-brown to rusty-brown, and the underparts pure white to pale brown. Found in reedbed wetland habitat, including papyrus. Far less secretive than many marsh-dwelling warblers; often hops about in the open. Frequently sings a variable, complex mix of raspy and musical notes that usually ends in a trill. Smaller than Greater Swamp Warbler, larger than African Reed Warbler, and shorter-winged than Great Reed Warbler."
0,Lesser Vasa Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Coracopsis nigra,https://ebird.org/species/blapar1,"Fairly large, black parrot that is found in and around all types of forest. Often seen in flight, sometimes in small, loose flocks. Incredibly loud calls consist mainly of musical whistles. Can be very hard to separate from Greater Vasa Parrot, but smaller and smaller-billed, with a curving edge to the skin at the back of the bill. Vocalizations are higher-pitched and more musical than those of Greater Vasa Parrot. Can easily be mistaken for a raptor in flight, but has all-black plumage unlike any raptor in range."
0,Lesser Violetear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Colibri cyanotus,https://ebird.org/species/lesvio1,"Medium-sized hummingbird, all sparkly green with obvious blue or purple cheek patch. Bill is slightly decurved. Sexes similar. Extremely similar to Mexican Violetear, but no range overlap. Sparkling Violetear of South America is larger and has violet belly. Found singly in forests, where it can be quite common. Also visits feeders and gardens. Listen for the constant chipping song."
0,Lesser Whistling-Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Dendrocygna javanica,https://ebird.org/species/lewduc1,"A small, well-proportioned, tree-nesting duck. Pale brown overall with a darker brown crown and nape, warmer chestnut underparts, and chestnut-fringed feathers on the back. Note the faint orange-yellow eyering and the dark gray bill and legs. Sexes similar; juveniles duller. A gregarious duck found in shallow water bodies with abundant vegetation. Flies with rapid wingbeats on broad dark wings; note flashing chestnut shoulders and chestnut rump. Call is a wheezy whistling “seasick-seasick."""
0,Lesser Whitethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca curruca,https://ebird.org/species/leswhi4,"Fairly common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa.

0,Lesser Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Xiphorhynchus fuscus,https://ebird.org/species/leswoo2,"Small, slim woodcreeper with a thin slightly decurved bill. Found in a variety of forest habitats, where it regularly follows mixed-species flocks. The rufous-brown body is heavily marked with drop-shaped spots on the breast, head, and back. The strong pale eyering, eyestripe, and throat add to the overall pale appearance of the head."
0,Lesser Yellowlegs,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa flavipes,https://ebird.org/species/lesyel,"Medium-sized shorebird with bright yellow legs. Plumage is essentially identical to Greater Yellowlegs: gray upperparts with white speckling, streaky neck, and white belly. Proportions are most important for identification. Lesser is smaller overall with shorter, narrower, straighter bill, shorter neck, more rounded head, and smaller chest. Forages actively on mudflats and in shallow pools and marshes, often in loose mixed flocks with Greater Yellowlegs. Somewhat more likely to be found in smaller, marshier habitats than Greater, but much overlap. Listen for soft, whistled “tew” calls, typically only one or two notes, unlike the stronger series of notes from Greater."
0,Lesser Yellownape,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picus chlorolophus,https://ebird.org/species/lesyel1,"Medium-sized woodpecker with a colorful crest. Coloration varies considerably based on range, but always look for a bright yellow hindcrest, overall greenish coloration, and white-barred chest. Greater Yellownape is significantly larger with an all-gray belly.

0,Lesson's Motmot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Momotidae,Momotus lessonii,https://ebird.org/species/bucmot2,"Large motmot of tropical lowland forest and edge, mainly in humid areas. Perches low to high, usually in shady areas. Blue crown with a big black central patch, unlike solid blue of Blue-capped Motmot, which occurs to the north. Plumage overall less contrasting in pattern than Turquoise-browed Motmot, with much smaller tail rackets. The name ‘motmot’ comes from double-hooting call of this species, which can sound like an owl, and is mainly uttered around dawn."
0,Lesson's Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sporophila bouvronides,https://ebird.org/species/lessee2,"Small, sparrow-like bird. Male has mostly black head with large white whisker mark; female is olive-brown on back and pale yellowish below with a dull yellow bill. Found in open marshlands and disturbed habitats with long grass, especially near water; often seen in flocks, feeding on grass seeds. Song is a staccato series of about 10 notes on one pitch. Most similar to Lined Seedeater, but male Lesson’s lacks a white stripe on crown; females of the two species are identical and not safely identified unless accompanied by males. Females are best told from other seedeaters (except Lined) by strong yellowish wash on underparts and relatively small, dull yellow bill."
0,Lettered Aracari,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Ramphastidae,Pteroglossus inscriptus,https://ebird.org/species/letara1,"Small toucan found across southern Amazonia. Unlikely to be confused in range. Essentially dark above with entirely yellow underparts; note the bare blue skin above the eye. Named for the squiggly dark markings on the bill.

0,Levaillant's Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola tinniens,https://ebird.org/species/tincis1,"Relatively colorful, mid-sized, long-tailed cisticola of wetlands. Note the heavily streaked back and rump, and rufous in the cap, wing, and tail. Found in and adjacent to dense wetland habitats. Distinctive song is an introductory “chip” note or two followed by a quick, warbled jumble. Similar to Winding Cisticola, but Levaillant’s has a rufous tail and a streaked rump. Relatively bold colors separate the two from other cisticolas."
0,Levaillant's Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Clamator levaillantii,https://ebird.org/species/levcuc1,"A large, dark-backed cuckoo with a floppy crest, white wing patches, and pale underparts; throat and lower flanks both heavily streaked. It is a brood parasite on babblers and other medium-sized birds. It calls a shrill “kreeeuu”, which is often followed by harsh chattering notes. Levaillant’s Cuckoo is similar to the smaller Pied Cuckoo, which lacks throat streaking and has a smaller crest. Dark morphs of both species are almost identical and can only reliably be told apart by size."
0,Levaillant's Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picus vaillantii,https://ebird.org/species/levwoo1,Medium-sized green woodpecker that is similar to Iberian Green Woodpecker.

Cheek patch is often a crescent compared to the circular patch on Graceful Honeyeater and the oval path on Yellow-spotted Honeyeater. Adults have a bluish eye, while the similar Graceful Honeyeater has a blue-gray eye and Yellow-spotted Honeyeater has a brown eye. Listen for the rapid staccato machine-gun call of Lewin’s compared to the loud repeated whistles of the Yellow-spotted Honeyeater and the more simple, single note call of Graceful Honeyeater. Of the three easily confusable species, this is the only one found away from the tropics; it occurs in wetter forests and gardens all along the eastern coast of Australia."
0,Lewin's Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Lewinia pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/lewrai1,"Cryptic rail with long, decurved bill. Adult has reddish-brown crown and nape, gray breast, and black-and-white barred belly. Darker juvenile very dull in comparison and lacks the reddish-brown crown.

0,Little Green-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Treron olax,https://ebird.org/species/ligpig1,"This aptly-named forest species is the smallest of the green-pigeons. Males are highly distinctive, with a blue-gray head and neck, orange chest, pinkish-maroon back, and green belly. Females are duller, but their combination of size, gray crown, and contrasting yellow-green chest serves to tell them apart from other green-pigeons. Pairs often forage and perch together, often on exposed bare branches. Like other pigeons, frequently gathers at fruiting trees. Song is a series of strangely buzzy rising whistles."
0,Little Green Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Anthreptes seimundi,https://ebird.org/species/ligsun2,"Tiny, drab warbler-like sunbird. The bill is slightly curved and partially pink. Also note the pale eye-ring. Found in the canopy and mid-story of humid forest at low and middle elevations, usually in pairs or small groups. The most common call is a simple, high-pitched “tseeet”. Very similar to Bates’s Sunbird, but has a less curved bill and a more distinct eye-ring. Distinguished from females of other species of sunbirds by the pink on the bill and the green rather than blackish tail."
0,Little Green Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campethera maculosa,https://ebird.org/species/ligwoo1,"A small woodpecker with a green back, barred underparts, and a finely speckled face without strong markings. The crown is red in males and black in females. Inconspicuous in lowland rainforest, including in edge habitat and clearings. The call is an arresting “ka-reek,” sometimes repeated several times. Very similar to Green-backed Woodpecker, though there is only a small area of range overlap. Distinguished by subtle details, including the all-black rather than olive-and-black tail. Female further distinguished by the all-black rather than red-and-black crown."
0,Little Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Eurillas virens,https://ebird.org/species/litgre2,"This small greenbul is unusually plain, even by the standards of greenbuls. It does show a rusty tinge to the tail. Found in the understory and mid-story of forest, thickets, and overgrown cultivation. Skulking bird that is difficult to see well, but which is often common. Usually detected by distinctive song, which starts with hesitant introductory notes, then finishes with an explosive, bubbling jumble of notes. Very similar to several other greenbul species.

0,Little Pied Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula westermanni,https://ebird.org/species/lipfly1,"Male is strikingly unique with his bold black-and-white patterning. Female is unique in her plainness: somber gray-brown above with pale underparts and a slightly cinnamon tint to the rump. Breeds in broadleaf, coniferous, and mixed forests in foothills and montane areas. Himalayan birds descend into lower foothills in the winter. Sallies from exposed perches in the upper and middle levels of the forest and moves with mixed flocks in the non-breeding season. Vocalizations are variable, and include a series of high notes followed by buzzing and tinkling notes (“chi-chi-chi-brr-titititi”), a steadily accelerating series of chiming notes, and a series of clear bell-like phrases followed by a short buzzy sputtering. Calls include high notes and rolling low rattles."
0,Little Raven,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus mellori,https://ebird.org/species/litrav1,"Australian crows and ravens are challenging to identify; concentrate on call, throat-hackles, behavior, and location. Calls usually fairly fast and lack the drawn-out wail typical of Australian Raven. Long throat hackles lend it a slightly bearded appearance. Often flicks wings when calling. Inhabits a broad area of southeastern Australia. The default crow/raven in Adelaide and Melbourne and forms very large flocks in high-elevation areas like the Australian Alps."
0,Little Ringed Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius dubius,https://ebird.org/species/lirplo,"Delicately built small plover with bright yellow eyerings. Note dull pinkish legs and large white forehead patch (in adults). Plumage much like bulkier Ringed Plover, but white eyebrow continues unbroken across forehead. In flight shows narrow, indistinct whitish wing stripe. Breeds on stony substrates around lakes, gravel pits, and along rivers; migrants occur in wide variety of fresh and brackish wetland habitats, but rarely out on open tidal areas. Clipped “peu” call quite distinct from call of similar Common Ringed Plover."

Found locally in a variety of habitats with a mix of rocks, trees, and bushes. Sometimes also on and around human structures. Similar to redstarts, but easily distinguished by the clean gray hood and the lack of black on the face. Also similar to male Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush, but smaller, lacking white on the back, and with a more extensive gray hood. The quiet song consists of musical phrases that can be short or quite long."
0,Little Rush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus baboecala,https://ebird.org/species/afbwar1,"A nondescript long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Varies geographically: the back can be dark brown or rusty brown, and the underparts can have heavy distinct streaking or a bit of blurry streaking. Found in reedbed wetland habitat, including papyrus. Extremely secretive and skulking. Most often seen when it sits up to sing or gives a short display flight. Song starts with slow, hesitant, low wooden notes that speed up, then ends with a trill made by beating the wings together at incredible speed. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed-warblers and swamp-warblers. Very similar to Highland Rush Warbler, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Little sings a much lower-pitched song."
0,Little Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus assimilis,https://ebird.org/species/litshe8,"A small, pale-faced shearwater with the separation line between black and white on the face passing through or above the eye. Mainly sedentary and relatively shy, feeding farther offshore than similar seabirds. Winter breeding birds mainly found around the Kermadec Islands, off southwest Australia, and off the northeastern coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The Fluttering Shearwater can be distinguished by its larger size, smudgy brown underwing, dark face, and tendency to congregate in flocks much closer to shore."
0,Little Slaty Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula basilanica,https://ebird.org/species/lisfly1,"A small bird of tangled undergrowth in lowland and foothill forest. White below with pale orange legs. Male has dark gray upperparts and a short white stripe behind each eye. Upperparts are dark brown in female with no head stripes.

0,Little Spotted Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx owenii,https://ebird.org/species/liskiw1,"New Zealand’s smallest kiwi species. Light grayish brown with white horizontal banding or “spotting” along the length of the body. Restricted to offshore predator-free island sanctuaries and to the mainland Zealandia sanctuary in Wellington. More often heard than seen, including loud sniffling as it forages for invertebrates. Male produces a series of burry, rising high-pitched whistles. Female has a lower ascending burry whistle. Both sexes repeat their call many times, often duetting. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Little Stint,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris minuta,https://ebird.org/species/litsti,"Tiny shorebird with extensive range across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Very rare vagrant in North America. All ages show dark legs and a straight, fine-tipped bill. Adults in breeding plumage are variably flushed with bright rusty orange on the head, neck sides, and upperparts, usually brightest in mid- to late-summer. Compared with breeding Red-necked Stint, note white throat and more uniformly bright wing coverts and scapulars on Little. Juveniles are typically quite bright and neatly patterned above, often with bold white stripes or ""braces"" down the back, and have very black-centered wing coverts and tertials. Nonbreeding birds rather plain pale gray and extremely difficult to separate from other small “peeps”. Note bill shape and overall structure. Temminck’s has longer tail and more crouched posture; Red-necked has slightly shorter bill and legs and more attenuated wings. Found in fresh and brackish wetland habitats.

0,Little Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sternula albifrons,https://ebird.org/species/litter1,"Tiny, delicate-looking tern. Mainly coastal, but also occurs inland locally. Breeding plumage has black cap with white forehead chevron, black-tipped yellow bill. Readily identified by tiny size, though wintering adults can be confusingly similar in patterning to Common Tern; look out for black stripes extending from the shoulder to the wingtip. Breeds colonially on sandy and stony substrates, at times with other terns, from beaches to riverbanks and lakeshores. Often overlooked unless noisy and mobbing you at a colony. Flies with hurried deep wingbeats; splash dives in water to catch small fish."
0,Little Thornbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Phacellodomus sibilatrix,https://ebird.org/species/littho1,"The smallest thornbird. Plumage dull brown, tinged with cinnamon.

Female is similar to female Crested Satinbird and MacGregor’s Bowerbird but it is smaller, overall color is olive green rather than brown and lacks Crested Satinbird’s pale eye. Male gives a far-carrying, nasal whistle from an exposed perch."
0,Loten's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris lotenius,https://ebird.org/species/lobsun2,"Medium-sized sunbird with a deeply curved bill. Glossy purple male is larger and longer-billed than somewhat similar Purple Sunbird. Female, with her sharply demarcated white underparts and dark gray upperparts, is unmistakable. Found in both wooded habitats and more open areas, including around human habitation."
0,Louisiade Flowerpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicaeidae,Dicaeum nitidum,https://ebird.org/species/louflo1,"A tiny bird of forest canopy on the southeast islands of New Guinea. Medium gray above and pale gray below with whitish throat and yellowish belly. Large, bright red rump and small red crown patch. Male has glossy green wing and red chest patch. The female’s whitish throat extends to the chest. The only flowerpecker in range. Smaller and shorter-billed than a female Purple Sunbird. Song, a short, up-and-down, high-pitch melody."
0,Louisiade Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Erythropitta meeki,https://ebird.org/species/loupit1,"A very shy, and seldom seen ground bird of lowland and foothill rainforest. Bright red belly and blue chest separated by a black band. Brown-hooded appearance but darker in the throat. Blue wing and green back. No similar species in range. Vocalizations not well-known, but probably quite similar to Papuan Pitta."
0,Louisiade Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala collaris,https://ebird.org/species/louwhi1,"An uncommon, medium-sized bird of coastal forest in New Guinea’s southeastern islands. Typical “golden whistler”. Olive back, yellow belly and white throat. Male has yellow patch on the back of the head, black head and a black or rusty chest band. Female has a brown head.

0,Louisiana Waterthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Parkesia motacilla,https://ebird.org/species/louwat,"Brown-and-white denizen of bubbling streams and brooks. Look for white underparts with dark streaks, light buffy wash on the rear flanks, and bold white eyebrow. Stays on or near the ground, constantly bobbing its rear end up and down. Males sometime perch up high to sing. A very early migrant: arrives on the breeding grounds in eastern North America before most other warblers have even dreamed of starting migration, and arrives back on the wintering grounds as early as July or August. During the breeding season, favors fast-moving streams with lots of rocks to hop on. In the northern parts of its range, often in steep hemlock-lined ravines. Winters primarily in Middle America and the Caribbean, where it’s slightly less picky about habitat, and can be found around slower-moving water. Very similar to Northern Waterthrush, but whiter base color below, brighter pink legs, and broader white eyebrow. Also look for clean white throat (usually streaked on Northern). Best distinguished by song: several piercing clear whistles followed by a complex jumble of notes. Call note very similar to Northern: a loud, metallic chip."
0,Lovely Cotinga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Cotinga amabilis,https://ebird.org/species/lovcot1,"Unobtrusive, rather chunky bird of forest canopy in tropical forest of humid lowlands. Most often seen as a single male perched on exposed high branches, less often at fruiting trees where can be quite low. Male is unmistakable: brilliant electric blue (glowing even at long range) with plum-colored throat and belly patch. Female very different: pale grayish overall with white scalloping above and dusky dappling below. Basically silent."
0,Lovely Fairywren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Malurus amabilis,https://ebird.org/species/lovfai1,"A small bird with a long blue and white tail that is held cocked. Tail is much shorter than that of Variegated Fairywren. Breeding male has a pale blue helmet, brownish wings, and a white belly. Females and nonbreeding males are similar to each other: they are completely white underneath (all the way up to the chin) with blue back, crown, and cheeks. They have white eye rings and white in front of their eyes, giving them a spectacled appearance. This species is typically found on the edges of rainforests, mangroves, and dense vegetation in coastal far northern Queensland, where it is the only ""blue"" fairywren."
0,Lovely Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/lovsun1,"A tiny bird of wooded areas from the lowlands to the mountains of Palawan and neighboring islands. Has a fairly long, curved bill, a whitish belly, and olive wings. Male has a pointed green tail, a bright red back, sides, and head, a purple crown and moustache stripe, and a yellow chest with fine red streaking. Male is unmistakable. The drab female is similar to other female sunbirds, but is the only one with a combination of very small size, pale underparts, and olive wings. Voice is a repeated up-and-down “chip-chap! chip-chap! chip-chap!”"
0,Loveridge's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris loveridgei,https://ebird.org/species/lovsun3,"A medium-sized sunbird. Males are colorful, with green upperparts and hood, a yellow belly, and an orangey-red patch on the chest. Females are drab brownish. Endemic to central Tanzania’s Uluguru Mountains. Found in montane forest, especially clearings and forest edge. Separated from similar sunbirds by range. Female could be mistaken for female Variable Sunbird, but is darker on the throat and breast, making for less contrast with the dark head. The calls include a long, descending whistle and a harsh “chet” that often precedes a very quick jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Lowland Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia cyornithopsis,https://ebird.org/species/lowaka1,"A small shy akalat found in the lower levels of tall forests, often in dark shady areas near water. Note the reddish-brown back and wings, the gray face, and the bright red-orange chest contrasting with a white belly. Almost always found in lowland forest, but a few local populations are found higher up in the foothills. Within its range, most likely to be confused with Forest Robin, but note Lowland Akalat’s plain gray face and distinctive vocalizations. Song is a series of clear, melancholy whistles given with slight pauses in between, “wheeer, gowheer,” as well as faster, more resonant and metallic series of whistles."
0,Lowland Peltops,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Artamidae,Peltops blainvillii,https://ebird.org/species/lowpel1,"A medium-sized bird of lowland forest edge and clearings. Distinctive plumage. Mainly black, bright red above and below the base of the tail, and white marks on the cheek and back. Perches in tall trees, sallying for flying insects. Very similar to Mountain Peltops, but Lowland is found at lower elevations and has a smaller white cheek. Voice, a double note rap, “plik-it!” repeated at regular intervals. Also, a distinctive, unbirdlike, vibrating rattle."
0,Lowland Sooty Boubou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius leucorhynchus,https://ebird.org/species/soobou1,"An entirely dark boubou found in thickets and dense vegetation. Widespread, but can be surprisingly rare and local in many parts of its range. A distinctively nondescript medium-sized skulking forest bird whose most obvious field mark is a lack of field marks, as it is wholly dark all over. The scientific name, which means “white-billed,” refers to young birds, whose bills start out white and darken with age. Similar to other species of sooty boubou, but Lowland Sooty Boubou is found at lower elevations and has a distinctive voice: a series of drawn out, ringing hoots or whistles, given singly or in short groups. Calls are harsh, sometimes mechanical chatters."
0,Luapula Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola luapula,https://ebird.org/species/wincis5,"Relatively colorful, mid-sized, long-tailed cisticola. Note the brown back with thick black streaks, rufous on the wing and cap, and pale underparts. The base color of the back is gray in breeding plumage and rufous in non-breeding plumage. Found in wetland habitats, especially wet scrub. The song is a few “pleek” calls followed by several lower “chek” notes. Very similar to Chirping Cisticola, and best separated by song. Visually, Luapula Cisticola is slightly smaller, the tail is grayer, and the rufous crown and wing patch are brighter."
0,Lucy's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Leiothlypis luciae,https://ebird.org/species/lucwar,"Tiny, nondescript warbler of mesquite woodlands and shrubbery. Plain gray with a whiter belly, faint white eyering, and rufous rump. Rufous crown patch is usually difficult to see. Active, constantly flitting around in brushy areas. Listen for sweet song similar to Yellow Warbler, but typically including sharper notes at the end. Mainly breeds in the southwest U.S.; departs breeding grounds early in summer and migrates to the Pacific slope of Mexico (rarely as far south as Oaxaca) for the winter. Most similar to Virginia’s Warbler, but Lucy’s totally lacks yellow. Also compare with Verdin, but note bill shape."
0,Ludwig's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Neotis ludwigii,https://ebird.org/species/ludbus1,"A large-to-medium-sized bustard with a dull orangish nape and hind neck, and dark gray-brown fore neck and face. Female and juvenile are smaller than male and paler on the face and throat. Pairs and small groups march purposefully in open shrubland and arid woodland in the Karoo and Kalahari. It is partially nomadic within its range and can gather in groups of up to 70 individuals after good rains. The much larger Kori Bustard has a barred grayish neck. Denham’s Bustard has a pale gray fore neck, rather than the dark gray-brown fore neck of Ludwig’s Bustard."
0,Lake Lufira Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus ruweti,https://ebird.org/species/lalmaw1,"A red-eyed masked-weaver with a plain olive-yellow back and pink-brown legs. The breeding male has a black face mask extending to the hind-crown and almost enveloping the head, and a strong chestnut breast and flanks (mid-belly is yellowish). Female and juvenile are dull green above with wingbars, and yellowish below. Pairs and colonies are very localized residents of riverside vegetation, preferring trees to reedbeds for breeding, at Lake Tshangalele and Kiubo Falls in the southeastern DRC. The ranges of most similar masked-weavers do not overlap, but breeding male Tanganyika Masked-Weaver has a less extensive black mask; Katanga and Southern Masked-Weavers are much yellower."
0,Lunulated Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Oneillornis lunulatus,https://ebird.org/species/lunant2,"Scarce antbird of lowland rainforest understory in eastern Ecuador and northeastern Peru. Both sexes have white throat and eyebrow. Male is otherwise all gray, and female is brown with tan scaling on upperparts and buff spots in the tail. Male is similar to White-throated Antbird, but lacks white barring in tail; also note range and voice. Typically found alone or in pairs, often around swarms of marauding army ants.

0,Luzon Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus longicornis,https://ebird.org/species/lusowl1,"A fairly small owl of lower-elevation montane forest on Luzon. Dark brown on the head, chest, and upperparts, with barred flight feathers. Eyebrows, beard, and belly whitish, with some patterning. Overlaps geographically with Philippine Scops-Owl, but Luzon is smaller, usually found at higher elevation, and has yellow rather than orange-brown eyes. Voice includes a single slightly rising then falling whistled note, repeated at intervals."
0,Luzon Striped-Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Zosterornis striatus,https://ebird.org/species/lusbab1,"A fairly small bird of lowland and foothill forest and overgrown disturbed areas on Luzon. Rufous-brown on the wings, back, and tail, with a gray head, heavily-streaked pale underparts, and a black face and moustache stripe. Often found in mixed-species flocks. Somewhat similar to Stripe-sided and Long-billed Rhabdornises, but smaller, with a white eye-ring rather than a black band through the eye. Voice includes a loud rattling trill and various quiet chips and squeals."
0,Lühder's Bushshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius luehderi,https://ebird.org/species/luebus1,"Distinctive and attractive mid-sized bushshrike. Adults have black upperparts with a white slash across the wing. The top of the head and the breast are orange, and the belly white.

0,MacGillivray's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Geothlypis tolmiei,https://ebird.org/species/macwar,"Chunky, skulking warbler that favors dense undergrowth. Yellow below and olive above with blue-gray head and chest. Blacker lores set off distinctive white arcs above and below eye. Adult males show darkest head; females and immatures have paler gray head and whitish throat. Found in thickets, clearcuts, open mixed forests, and riparian zones. Breeds primarily in mountainous regions of western North America; winters from Mexico to Costa Rica. Compare with Mourning Warbler, but little range overlap, and note longer tail and white eye-arcs on MacGillivray’s."
0,MacGregor's Bowerbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Amblyornis macgregoriae,https://ebird.org/species/macbow2,"The common and widespread bowerbird of montane forests. Fairly large, stocky brown like other closely-related species, but the male has a long, flowing, orange crest from the back of its head. The male builds a “Maypole” bower of sticks from a central pole and has a circular mossy arena at the base. Similar to the Streaked Bowerbird, but MacGregor's Bowerbird is found higher up and is larger and unstreaked. Call, a loud rasping. Various whistles and other sounds made at the bower, including mimicry."
0,Macgregor's Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Macgregoria pulchra,https://ebird.org/species/machon3,"A huge distinctive honeyeater of high montane forests and shrubbery. Plump shape and almost entirely black with large orange wattles on the head and orange wing feathers which are very obvious in flight. A territorial and fruit-eating species that is very obvious and easy to see. Smoky Honeyeaters have a similar color scheme but are much smaller. Call is a quiet, fairly high-pitch “cheeep!” note that sounds like it should come from a smaller bird. Also, a series of quicker “chip” notes."
0,Macqueen's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Chlamydotis macqueenii,https://ebird.org/species/macbus1,"A medium-to-large bustard; significantly smaller than Great Bustard, but larger than Little Bustard. Overall tones are rather pale sandy. The neck is white with a vertical black stripe, most prominent in adult males. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. Very similar to African Houbara Bustard, separated mainly by range. Display of male is an amusing dance in long straight lines across open hills with white ornamental feathers covering its tilting head. Breeds in dry steppe and semi-desert with scattered shrubs. Eastern populations migratory. Normally mute."
0,Macaroni Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes chrysolophus,https://ebird.org/species/macpen1,"Medium-sized bulky penguin with a bulbous red bill and a dash of stiff orange “hair.” Disappointingly, named for the resemblance of its spiffy, “fashionable” crest to the hairstyle of fashionable youth, or “macaronis”, and not for the pasta-sauce-orange color of the crest itself. Similar to Southern Rockhopper Penguin, but note Macaroni’s larger size, much more heavy build, chunkier bill, and a droopier, more orange, crest. Breeds in noisy colonies on rocky islands, across a wide area of the Subantarctic and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula."
0,Maccoa Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Oxyura maccoa,https://ebird.org/species/macduc1,"Medium-sized, chunky, oddly shaped, big-billed duck. Long tail is sometimes cocked up to produce a distinctive silhouette. Breeding male has a black head, rufous body, and blue bill. Female and non-breeding male are dark brown with white head stripes. Prefers freshwater wetlands such as lakes, ponds, and lagoons, though sometimes found on saline lakes. Floats low on the water. Rarely seen in flight; prefers to dive to flee disturbance. Odd shape is unlike any other duck in its range. Colorful breeding male is distinctive."
0,Mackinnon's Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius mackinnoni,https://ebird.org/species/macshr1,"Medium-sized, slim shrike patterned in dark gray, black, and white. The male has completely white underparts, while the female has a rufous flank patch. There are large white slashes across the shoulders. Found along forest edge and in forest clearings, lush woodland, cultivations, and gardens. Usually seen singly or in pairs. The song is a slow, highly varied series of many different types of notes, and can include imitations of other birds. Similar to Northern Fiscal, but has a gray crown and back. Distinguished from other black-masked, gray-backed shrikes by the lack of a white nick on the wing."
0,Macleay's Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Xanthotis macleayanus,https://ebird.org/species/machon2,"Distinctive medium-sized rainforest honeyeater.

0,Madagascar Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo brachypterus,https://ebird.org/species/madbuz1,"Typical brown buzzard that is endemic to Madagascar. Found throughout the island in many different habitats, though absent from pure grassland. Voice is a series of increasingly strident wails, often given in flight. Distinguished in flight from Madagascar Cuckoo-Hawk by larger size, less paddle-shaped wings, and the pale panels toward the tips of the wings. When perched, look for a paler chest and heavily marked belly, whereas Madagascar Cuckoo-Hawk shows the opposite. Separated from immature Madagascar Harrier-Hawk by dark head and lack of pale fringes on the wing."
0,Madanga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Madanga ruficollis,https://ebird.org/species/rtweye1,"A little-known, highly unusual songbird confined to the island of Buru. Taxonomically confusing; formerly considered a white-eye, but now thought to be an abnormal, arboreal pipit. A plain-looking bird with dull olive upperside and gray upperparts, but with a diagnostic, conspicuous rust-colored throat. Inhabits stunted montane forest, where it behaves like a nuthatch, climbing up and down tree trunks, and often accompanies mixed-species flocks singly or in pairs. Only known vocalization is short, high-pitched, downslurred “zit” note."

0,Magdalena Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Sipia palliata,https://ebird.org/species/dumant3,"Medium-sized, short-tailed antbird with a bright red eye. Has slate gray head and breast, black throat, brown belly and upperparts, and whitish dotted wings. Female is similar but has a white barred throat and buffy dots in the wings. No overlap with the similar Dull-mantled or Esmeraldas Antbirds. Often found in pairs, typically in rocky shaded ravines along streams in foothills. Often quite vocal; song a strong, relatively high-pitched series of notes “fee-feet-feet-FEET-feteu-feek!”, and call is a harsh “FEeuh.”"
0,Magdalena Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus rodriguezi,https://ebird.org/species/upmtap1,"This tapaculo is a Colombian endemic with two widely separated populations in the eastern Andes. Adult is gray with rusty barring on lower underparts and rump. Young birds are washed and scaled with brown. Very similar to Spillmann’s Tapaculo and Long-tailed Tapaculo, and ID should be based on voice. Song is a seemingly endless series of soft chirps that can continue for a minute or more. Inhabits cloud forest understory and usually quite hard to see well."
0,Magellanic Diving-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pelecanoides magellani,https://ebird.org/species/madpet1,"Very small diving seabird. Fairly common locally in fjords, channels, and the Strait of Magellan, where it can be seen from shore and ferries; uncommon out in open ocean. Swims low in the water and usually dives when approached or runs along the water to fly away from boats. Flight is low and fast over the sea with rapid “whirring” wingbeats; does not glide. Plumage blackish above, whitish below with contrasting white neck sides and a black cap, unlike other diving-petrels."
0,Magellanic Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus leucopodus,https://ebird.org/species/magoys1,"A boldly patterned large and chunky shorebird of southern South America and Falklands. Favors rocky coastlines and adjacent river mouths, but also frequent on nearby grasslands and lakeshores. Associates readily with other oystercatchers. Told from American Oystercatcher by its glossy black head and upperparts that lack the white shoulder spur. In flight the distinctive upperwing pattern with big white panel on trailing edge separates it from American. At close range, also note the yellow eyering (red on American). Voice is also very distinct from other oystercatchers."
0,Magellanic Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus magellanicus,https://ebird.org/species/magpen1,"Fairly common to locally common; often seen in inshore waters and from ferries. Breeds around coasts of southern Chile, Argentina, and in the Falklands; nests in colonies in underground burrows. Only identification concern is limited range overlap in central Chile with Humboldt Penguin, which has single (not double) black breast band, narrower white eyebrow, and big pink patch at base of bill. Immatures of the two species very similar and not always safely identified in the field, but Humboldt often shows big pink patch at base of bill."
0,Magellanic Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Pluvianellidae,Pluvianellus socialis,https://ebird.org/species/magplo1,"Uncommon and local in Patagonia, where it favors stony lakeshores; also adjacent coastlines, mainly in winter. Easily overlooked; its mostly gray plumage helps it blend in. Usually in pairs or small groups, feeding mainly along shorelines or wading in shallows; sometimes associates loosely with migrant White-rumped and Baird’s Sandpipers. Stocky shape, plain dove-gray upperparts, and bright pinkish legs are a distinctive combination. In flight shows a white wing stripe, like many other shorebirds. Placed in its own family; more closely related to sheathbills than to plovers."
0,Magellanic Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago magellanica,https://ebird.org/species/soasni3,"Cryptic shorebird found predominately in lowland wet grasslands and flooded fields. Note the long straight bill, white belly with variegated cryptic plumage, and prominent contrasting pale lines on the face and back. In flight, shows a white terminal tail band. Sings a repetitive “kek kek kek kek” when on the ground. Also listen for harsh and vibrating “drumming” notes given in stuttered couplets, produced with its tail feathers during flight displays. Occurs from central Chile to southern Argentina, extensively across the Patagonia region, including the Falkland Islands. Formerly known as South American Snipe."
0,Magellanic Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus magellanicus,https://ebird.org/species/magtap1,"Often heard but rarely seen; a retiring little gray bird of bamboo thickets and other dense shrubbery at forest edges and along streams, mainly in humid areas. Occurs locally in boulders and low scrub, mainly in the Andes. Can move very quickly through bamboo like a mouse. Plumage is slaty gray overall, often with some paler or brownish barring; some birds have a silvery-white cap or a few white head spots. Best told from Dusky Tapaculo, which has a limited range overlap by voice. Also compare with Ochre-flanked Tapaculo."
0,Magellanic Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campephilus magellanicus,https://ebird.org/species/magwoo1,"Very large black woodpecker of native forests with large diameter trees, from dense, bamboo-choked temperate rainforest to rather open and stunted woodlands in drier areas. Ranges widely in large territories, often in pairs or family groups. Can be very confiding, feeding quietly at close range, when best located by strong taps as it digs out grubs from rotting wood. Male has a flame-red head while the female’s head is black with a distinctive recurved crest. Drumming is a loud, resonant, rapid double-rap that carries well."
0,Magenta Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma magentae,https://ebird.org/species/magpet1,"One of the rarest seabirds in the world, endemic to the Chatham Islands. Medium-sized bird with a distinctive dark gray head, neck, and upper breast and a gray chin. The rest of the underside is white with a light gray underwing. During breeding, the birds mainly forage south and east of their colonies, venturing across the Pacific Ocean to South American and tropical seas in the winter. Many petrel species can appear similar to the Magenta Petrel but can be ruled out if they appear partially hooded, show traces of an “M” across their back, or are found outside of the Chatham Island range during breeding season."
0,Maghreb Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Galerida macrorhyncha,https://ebird.org/species/crelar3,"The North African counterpart of the very similar and closely-related Crested Lark.

0,Maghreb Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix mauritanica,https://ebird.org/species/tawowl3,"A medium-sized owl with deep black eyes, strictly nocturnal and infrequently seen. Gray to gray-brown overall with a big rounded head. Found at a broad range of elevations from sea level to high mountains, in woodland, forest, parkland, rocky areas, and sometimes towns and villages. Tends to roost well hidden in foliage during the day, when may be detected by tracking down the excited sound of small birds mobbing the owl. Comes out at night to hunt in clearings and more open areas. Most often detected by its quavering hoots and ""kee-wik!"" shrieks, given at night. Somewhat similar to Pharaoh Eagle-Owl, but smaller and grayer, with dark rather than yellow-orange eyes."
0,Magnificent Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata magnificens,https://ebird.org/species/magfri,"Massive seabird of warm tropical oceans and coastlines. Overall black with extremely long, deeply forked tail and angular wings. Male completely black with inflatable red pouch on throat (not seen away from breeding colonies) and bluish eyering. In good light, black coloration can show purplish sheen. Adult female has white chest and golden bar on shoulder. Young birds have white head and breast. Often soars for long periods and flies with slow wingbeats. Steals food from other seabirds. Surprisingly acrobatic during aerial chases despite its large size. Limited range overlap with Great Frigatebird (mainly offshore western Mexico and in the Galapagos); identification is complicated by age and sex variation. Adult males are extremely similar; females and immatures best identified by exact pattern of white on head and breast, bill color, and eyering color."
0,Magnificent Riflebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Ptiloris magnificus,https://ebird.org/species/magrif3,"Large songbird with a very long curved bill, found in rainforest on Cape York and in New Guinea.

0,Magnificent Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga magnifica,https://ebird.org/species/magsun1,"A stunning small bird of lowland and foothill scrub and gardens in the western Visayas. Male has a bright red head, back, and chest, a purple forehead, a broadening purple mustache stripe, a purple tail, black wings and belly, and a bright yellow patch on the lower back. Similar to Purple-throated, but larger; male lacks the purple throat, and female is mainly olive with distinctive reddish wings and tail. Call is a repeated high-pitched “chik!”"
0,Magnolia Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga magnolia,https://ebird.org/species/magwar,"Breeding males are striking and unmistakable: especially look for white wing patch, head pattern, and thick black streaks on underparts. Females and immatures are less obvious and might be mistaken for Canada Warbler, but combination of gray head, yellow underparts, white wingbars, and at least some dark streaks on the flanks is distinctive. Always look for tail pattern from below: basal half is white, tip is black. Breeds in coniferous forests, especially with dense understory. Migrants and wintering birds can be found in any wooded area or edge. Winters primarily in Central America and the Caribbean."
0,Magpie Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anseranatidae,Anseranas semipalmata,https://ebird.org/species/maggoo1,"Large black-and-white waterbird with bulbous lump on the top of its head and striking orange legs and feet.

The sexes have differently colored flanks: females white, males black. Small groups of 3 to 10 sit upright on perches 1 to 5 meters high in grassy open savanna and sparse broadleaf woodland. Perch-and-wait predators, they drop onto insect and small vertebrate prey, and often move locally into recently burned areas to forage. The species gives a shrill starling- or parrot-like “pleeee-eouuu,” often produced by more than one bird at once, and also gives harsh grating cries."
0,Magpie Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Speculipastor bicolor,https://ebird.org/species/magsta1,"An unusual and distinctive starling of dry country. Males are dark above and white below, with a blue-black hood and upperparts; females are dark gray. Both sexes have an orange eye and white patches in the wings that are conspicuous in flight.

It has a diffuse blue band on the sides of the head and breast, while a thick black traverse band separates the blue parts from the red. Some faint streaking visible below on an otherwise green ground color. Juvenile is duller green, lacks the prominent face pattern of the adult, sports a gray band instead of blue, and shows some yellow among the red feathers. Juvenile is best told from a juvenile Coppersmith Barbet by its unstreaked underparts. Malabar Barbet is heard more often than seen. Its call is a fast paced “kuk-kuk-kuk,” doubtfully separable from that of a Coppersmith by its sometimes slightly faster pace. Malabar sticks to the wetter jungles of the Western Ghats and does not occupy the drier or more open habitats of the Coppersmith, though in some localities both species co-occur."

The head is pure black in breeding plumage and streaked white in non-breeding plumage. Found in a wide variety of habitats, including forest, scrub, plantations, savannah, and marsh. Generally skulks in thick vegetation, anywhere from the ground to high in the canopy, though will sometimes sing from an exposed perch. “Water bottle” song is a beautiful descending series of “boop” notes. Call is a long, dry rattle. Size, shape, and dark coloration make it distinctive within its range."
0,Malagasy Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus macrosceles,https://ebird.org/species/reuhar3,"A typical harrier, with long slender wings and tail and graceful swooping flight. Male has pale gray panels in the wings, while female is browner and more uniform. Found mainly in open habitats, including marsh and montane grassland. Occasionally seen flying over forest. Spends long periods on the wing and is rarely seen perched. Most often confused with Black Kite, but has longer wings, a longer, narrower, and un-forked tail, a white rump, and pale underparts. Coloration overall similar to other raptors like Madagascar Buzzard, but lanky harrier shape is distinctive."

Black-and-white males larger and longer-tailed than Ward’s Flycatcher, without a black chest band. Rufous coloration, blue eye ring, and upright posture identify female."
0,Malagasy Pond-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola idae,https://ebird.org/species/mapher1,"Chunky, short-legged heron. All white with a black-tipped blue bill and bright red legs in breeding plumage. Dark brown with white wings and belly in non-breeding plumage. Found in a variety of freshwater wetlands, though generally rare. Distinctive in breeding plumage, but easily confused with Squacco Heron in non-breeding plumage, when Madagascar Pond-Heron can be carefully distinguished by the much darker brown color on most of the body, which contrasts sharply with the white belly and wing."

0,Malayan Night-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Gorsachius melanolophus,https://ebird.org/species/manher1,"Bizarre-looking bird with the squat, staring appearance of a toad. Adult is dark cinnamon-brown with a black crown and a black stripe running from the throat down to the breast. Juvenile is very different, with gray-brown barring all over the body (darkest on the crown). Breeding birds have an especially bright blue facial skin patch between the bill and the eyes; the patch is faded in non-breeders, and yellowish in juveniles. Japanese Night-Heron is similar but averages duller brown with less contrasting black patches. Typically nocturnal and furtive in forested areas, but can frequently be tame and active during the day as well."

Song is a short smooth series of drawn-out piping whistles."
0,Malaysian Eared-Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Lyncornis temminckii,https://ebird.org/species/malnig1,"Medium-sized nightjar with a long-necked and short-headed profile; namesake “ears'' are often difficult to see. Note dark face, thin off-white collar, and white slashes on the throat (most visible in flight). Unlike many other nightjars, often perches quite erect on branches. Very similar to Great Eared-Nightjar, with which it overlaps incrementally in northern Malaysia; in good lighting, note Malaysian’s less contrasting crown and overall darker coloration. Gives a ringing “wit-peew-ow!” in flight. Flies over a range of habitats, from lowland rainforests to open scrub forest and farmland."
0,Malaysian Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator archipelagicus,https://ebird.org/species/malhon1,"Uncommon and unobtrusive in lowland and foothill forests. Unremarkable yet distinctive in its appearance: olive brown above and pale below with a bicolored bill, somewhat resembling a large-bodied, small-headed sparrow in structure if not in size. Male has yellow edges on the wings and a blood-red eye; female lacks these yellow areas and has a duller brownish eye. Gives a nasal “nyeh!” as well as an odd, low grating trill.

Dark above and white below; note slender white eyebrows, black chest band, and white-tipped black tail. Combination of all-white belly and plain back separates this species from similar dark fantails within its range. Very active, often bobbing and fanning its tail. Frequently joins mixed-species flocks. Song is a very high-pitched, squeaky “chee-wee-chee-wee-chee-wee-chit”, with a short, falling last note. Calls include harsh churring and high-pitched squeaky chattering."
0,Malaysian Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius peronii,https://ebird.org/species/malplo1,"Small pale plover, typically found on sandy beaches. Occasionally visits estuaries, seawalls, and mudflats as well. Very similar in all plumages to Kentish Plover, with which it occasionally mixes. Male is sandy brown with a black collar, pale face, and a rufous-and-black crown. Thinner collar and eye-line than Kentish Plover. Female and juvenile are similarly brown with a white collar and face. All plumages have diagnostically pale-fringed feathers which give the bird a worn, faded-out appearance; molting Kentish Plover may appear worn but not in such a uniform manner."
0,Maleo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Macrocephalon maleo,https://ebird.org/species/maleo1,"A massive black-and-white megapode with a rose-pink breast and a diagnostic prominent knob on the nape.

0,Malherbe's Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Cyanoramphus malherbi,https://ebird.org/species/malpar2,"A small, green, long-tailed parakeet endemic to New Zealand. Note the distinct lemon-yellow crown and the thin orange band extending from the base of the beak to each red eye. Juveniles are a duller color and their orange band and crown may be absent. A critically endangered bird now restricted to three beech forest valleys in inland Canterbury and several offshore island sanctuaries. Usually very quiet and challenging to see. Listen for its loud, brief chatter call to give away its location. When pairs are together, softer contact calls can be heard. Forms small flocks in autumn and winter. Smaller size and lack of crimson frontal band and rump patches distinguish Malherbe’s from Yellow-crowned Parakeet. Juvenile Yellow-crowned Parakeet can confuse identification, and calls of the two species can be challenging to differentiate."
0,Mali Firefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lagonosticta virata,https://ebird.org/species/malfir1,"A small brown and reddish waxbill with a blue-gray bill and black under the tail. There are usually a few white spots along the shoulder, but these are sometimes lacking. Found locally in dry, rocky habitat with grass and bushes. Usually in pairs or small groups. Extremely similar to African Firefinch, but duller overall, with more red on the forehead and fewer white spots on the shoulders. Also similar to Red-billed and Bar-breasted Firefinches, but shows black under the tail. Calls include a short dry trill, a high “veet” note, and a long, lower “feeeu” note. Quiet song is a mix of low trills and higher-pitched whines and whistles."
0,Malia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Malia grata,https://ebird.org/species/malia1,"An oriole-sized, bulbul-like songbird confined to Sulawesi. Plain olive-green above and yellow below. Central and southeast Sulawesi form shows rufous wings and tail; elsewhere these are olive. Noisy pairs or small groups are leaders of mixed-species flocks within canopy and subcanopy of montane forest, often gleaning food from thick, mossy trunks. Large size, bulbul-like appearance, and behavior make it unmistakable. Raucous, jarring calls include loud chattering and explosive warbles. These are conspicuous and far-carrying."
0,Malindi Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus melindae,https://ebird.org/species/malpip1,"A large pipit with a long, strong bill and legs and a long tail. Shows heavy streaking on the underparts, brown upperparts, and a strong pale eyebrow. The base of the bill and the legs are bright pinkish-yellow. Found in coastal grasslands, especially seasonally flooded ones, and cultivated areas. Can be separated from other pipits by a combination of range, habitat, large size, sturdy structure, dark plumage overall, and very heavy streaking below. The song is a slowly repeated “churee” note, and the common call is a rising “sveet.”"
0,Mallard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas platyrhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/mallar3,"A large duck, generally common and familiar within its extensive range. Males are distinctive with iridescent green head, yellow bill, chestnut breast, and gray body. Females are mottled brown with orange and black splotches on the bill. Found anywhere with water, including city parks, backyard creeks, and various wetland habitats. Often in flocks, and frequently mixes with other duck species. In North America, females can be tricky to distinguish from American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, and Mexican Duck where ranges overlap. Those species are all darker-bodied than Mallard. A good view of the wing can be helpful, too: white wingbars on the leading and trailing edges of the blue wing patch are bolder on Mallard. Frequently hybridizes with those species, which can be even more confusing. Any bird with extensive white in the tail or curled feathers above the tail has some Mallard genes."
0,Mallee Emuwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Stipiturus mallee,https://ebird.org/species/malemu1,"Tiny buff-brown bird with enormously long, fine tail, found in areas of mallee woodland with large spinifex clumps in a small area of far western Victoria. Crown a clean, rich brown, with streaked back, wings, and cheek; underparts buffy brown. Males have a sky-blue throat. Tail is much longer and far more spindly than tail of fairywrens. The trick to finding this shy species is to find large unburned patches of spinifex, listening carefully for the species’ very thin, faint calls."
0,Malleefowl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Leipoa ocellata,https://ebird.org/species/mallee1,"Heavily-built grayish ground-dwelling bird with short heavy legs, gray neck and chest, and strongly marked (camouflaged) back and tail. Scarce endemic resident of semi-arid open forest (typically the multi-stemmed ""Mallee"" Eucalypt vegetation). Builds large nest-mounds from leaf litter. Most sightings are of single birds or pairs."
0,Mamberamo Shrikethrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Colluricincla obscura,https://ebird.org/species/litshr1,"A chunky bird with a notably thick dark bill. Quite plain: gray-brown on the upperparts and paler below, with indistinct breast streaking. Overall color varies geographically from dark gray to paler and browner, especially on the underparts. Found at low and middle elevations in humid forest, including secondary forest. Rich, melodious, variable song consists of several penetrating whistles, generally in an up-and-down pattern, often ending with a sharp upslurred note. Somewhat similar to Rusty Pitohui, but smaller, with a dark rather than pale eye. Can be very similar to Sooty Shrikethrush and Black Pitohui, but slightly paler, especially on the underparts, and shows some streaking on the breast."
0,Manchurian Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Horornis canturians,https://ebird.org/species/manbuw1,"Warm brownish songbird of shrubby forest edges, reedbeds, and gardens. Brown above, pale below, with pale supercilium and dark eyeline. Note rufous crown. Shy and skulking, rarely straying from dense undergrowth even when singing. Usually detected by its song, a long mournful whistle followed by a quick burst of rich, bubbly notes. All but indistinguishable from Japanese Bush Warbler; averages slightly more rufous on the crown, but best identified by range and voice."
0,Manchurian Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus tangorum,https://ebird.org/species/manrew1,"Small, shy, and poorly understood, this reed warbler breeds in the remote marshlands of northeastern China and Russia and winters in drier, grassier habitats in Southeast Asia. Warm brown overall with a clean-cut whitish brow and throat; brow extends well behind the eye, unlike in Blunt-winged Warbler. Very similar to extralimital Paddyfield Warbler, but Paddyfield shows dark-tipped lower mandible, duller brown tones overall, and a dirtier brow stripe with a distinctive pinch just before the eye, after which it fades out; Manchurian’s brow broadens behind the eye instead. Oriental Reed Warbler much larger, with a weaker head pattern. Rambling jumbled song consists of high-pitched warbling notes and sharp clicks and rattles; more pleasant-sounding than that of Oriental Reed Warbler."
0,Mandarin Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aix galericulata,https://ebird.org/species/manduc,"Small exotic-looking duck found at lakes and parks, usually with nearby trees. Male very ornate with big orangey ""sail fins"" on the back, streaked orangey cheeks, and a small red bill with a whitish tip. Female has narrow white spectacles on shaggy gray head, bold pale dappled spots along flanks, and pale bill tip. Mainly found in pairs or singly, but will gather in larger flocks over the winter; perches readily in trees over water. Native to East Asia, but has established feral populations throughout Western Europe."
0,Maned Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Jubula lettii,https://ebird.org/species/manowl1,"Distinctive and unusual rainforest owl. Mostly rufous-brown, with long, shaggy ear tufts and plumes at the back of the head. The eyes vary from yellow to orange. The breast is rufous and the belly is buff with fine black streaks. Rare and local in the understory of lowland rainforest in thick areas, usually those with abundant lianas. The voice is unknown. Somewhat similar to some eagle-owls, but smaller and slimmer, with differently shaped drooping ear tufts."
0,Mangareva Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus astrolabii,https://ebird.org/species/manrew2,"Extinct, last reported in 1839."
0,Mangrove Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis rufigastra,https://ebird.org/species/mabfly2,"Bright blue-and-orange flycatcher of coastal woodlands; found in mangroves, mangrove edge, coastal scrub, and plantations. Can be common on small, forested offshore islands where other blue flycatchers are absent. Male and female are similar, but the female has lighter orange underparts and a pale patch between the eye and the base of the bill. Habitat generally serves to identify this species, but also note extent of orange underparts, pale blue patch on the forehead, short bill, and dark rump and tail. Both sexes sing, giving a short but beautiful series of fluty whistles. Calls include a fast buzzing rattle and tapping notes, comparable to rocks being struck together."
0,Mangrove Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus minor,https://ebird.org/species/mancuc,"Slender, long-tailed bird found in shrubby woodland (especially mangroves). Brown above and buffy below with gray cap, black mask, and bold black-and-white pattern on underside of tail. Bill is black on top, yellow below. Similar to Yellow-billed Cuckoo, but note buffy belly, black mask, and no rufous in the wings. Shy; tends to sit still for long periods of time, can be difficult to spot. Song is a series of low croaking notes, gradually becoming longer and lower-pitched. Feeds primarily on insects and small reptiles."
0,Mangrove Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura phasiana,https://ebird.org/species/manfan1,"Small pale gray flycatcher, exclusively coastal and usually observed in or very close to mangroves. Pale gray head and back, white throat and chin, pale wingbars, and a very thin gray chest band. Holds tail up and frequently fans it as it forages. Compare Gray Fantail, which is larger, darker, and has a wider black chest band, and Northern Fantail, which has a pale-streaked gray chest without a dark narrow band and lacks the pale streak behind the eye."
0,Mangrove Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Camarhynchus heliobates,https://ebird.org/species/manfin1,"A critically endangered Galápagos finch and one of the world’s rarest birds. Currently known only from mangroves at a few sites (with restricted access) on Isabela. Formerly found on Fernandina, but there are no recent substantiated records there. Both sexes typically have brown upperparts, whitish underparts with tan streaking, and a faint eyebrow. Some older males may have a faint, dark hood. Bill is relatively long, with a curved upper edge and mostly straight lower edge. Male’s bill is black when breeding and slightly paler at other times. Female’s bill is orange. Similar to Woodpecker Finch, but that species has a longer bill and less prominent streaking."
0,Mangrove Gerygone,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Gerygone levigaster,https://ebird.org/species/manger1,"Small plain bird with thin bill. Upperparts gray, underparts whitish, with striking white tail spots (best seen in flight), pale eyebrow, and red eye. Usually detected by song, a tinkling melodious string of notes moving up and down in pitch (like a musician practicing scales). Inhabits mangroves and surrounding habitats, unlikely to be far from mangroves."
0,Mangrove Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Gavicalis fasciogularis,https://ebird.org/species/manhon1,"Medium-sized honeyeater found in coastal habitats of eastern Australia. Back is brown-green, breast is gray, and underparts are pale. Distinguished from Varied Honeyeater by presence of clear barring on the throat and lack of yellow underparts and breast streaking. Usually found in or around mangroves, where it is typically quite conspicuous and vocal."
0,Mangrove Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia boucardi,https://ebird.org/species/manhum1,"This restricted species is found only along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, most often in or near mangrove trees. Medium-sized hummingbird. Male has a glittering blue-green head and throat contrasting with a whitish belly. The base of the bill is red.

0,Mangrove Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Halcyon senegaloides,https://ebird.org/species/mankin2,"Mid-sized, big-billed, colorful kingfisher. Adults have an all-red bill and a pale gray head. Found in mangroves, coastal forest, woodland, and scrub. Loud call is an introductory note followed by a “bouncing ball” series of wooden trills. Woodland Kingfisher is similar, but Mangrove is separated by its grayer head and all-red bill. Immatures of the two species are very similar, but Mangrove usually shows a red bill with a black tip, as opposed to a mostly black bill in Woodland."
0,Mangrove Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Pitta megarhyncha,https://ebird.org/species/manpit1,"The huge crab-smashing bill of this mangrove specialist sets it apart from all other pittas. Brightly colored with a black mask, green-and-black wings, and a yellow belly. Similar in color to Blue-winged Pitta, but note Mangrove’s larger-headed appearance and habitat. Like other pittas, shy and difficult to see; listen for its throaty and fluid two-parted whistles."
0,Mangrove Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus longirostris,https://ebird.org/species/manrai1,"Large, generally drab rail, of coastal salt lagoons and mangrove forests. Dull grayish-brown overall with few contrasting features; faintly barred gray-and-white on sides and pale orange bill.

0,Mangrove Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Eopsaltria pulverulenta,https://ebird.org/species/manrob1,"Small round songbird of dense mangrove areas, particularly the large stilt-rooted mangroves. White below, dark gray above, with blackish wings and white patches on sides of black tail. Distinctive species, much more rotund than other white-chinned bird species in this habitat (e.g., female Shining Flycatcher). Voice is a plaintive, slow, whistled note, usually repeated."
0,Mangrove Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Tachycineta albilinea,https://ebird.org/species/manswa1,"Small swallow of tropical lowlands. Usually near water, from mangroves and coastal lagoons to rivers well inland; mainly in small groups, often mixed with other species of swallows. In its range, the big white rump patch is distinctive. Adult is metallic blue above with small white chevron across base of bill; gleaming white below. Juvenile has dusky gray-brown upperparts with white rump, looks like adult by early winter."
0,Mangrove Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo pallens,https://ebird.org/species/manvir1,"Despite the name, not found in mangroves in most of its range. Common in scrubby woodland, brushy fields, and thickets of Yucatan Peninsula. Also very local in mangroves along the Pacific coast. Best field marks are the white wingbars and the yellow patch between the eyes and bill; most birds are pale yellowish below, a few are paler and grayer overall. Birds in mangroves of Central America are often rather colorless, with very reduced yellow tones. Twanging song is a common sound in much of Yucatan Peninsula."
0,Mangrove Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala cinerea,https://ebird.org/species/manwhi1,"Drab small bird with brownish-gray upperparts and white underparts. Resides primarily in mangrove forest, but can also be found in other well-vegetated adjacent habitat types. Overall lack of prominent markings distinguishes it from other mangrove species within its range. Song varies; Indian birds give songs containing long ringing whistles, while Southeast Asian birds give somewhat more complex whistled phrases."
0,Manipur Bush-Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Perdicula manipurensis,https://ebird.org/species/mabqua1,"Poorly known. Small, dark gray quail with a short white eye-stripe. The dark upperparts are scaled with black, while the yellowish-brown belly has strong, black spots. The male has a reddish face, while the female’s face is gray. Extremely rare, and said to occur in damp grasslands and scrub. Historically, known to forage on the ground in small groups of 5-10 birds."

0,Manu Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacra manu,https://ebird.org/species/manant1,"Skinny antbird of bamboo stands. Males are dark gray or black with small white wing bars and white spots on the underside of the tail; females are gray below, brown above, looking dark overall, with faint buffy wing bars and spots on the underside of the tail. Almost always found in bamboo thickets. Listen for its distinctive song, a rubbery, bouncing “pook-cha-pook-cha-pook-cha.” Distinguished from the similar Gray Antbird by male’s nearly black plumage (not gray) and female’s grayer underparts (not uniformly brown). Males also are similar to Dot-winged Antwren, but are larger, with less white on the wing bars and slightly lighter overall plumage (not glossy black like the antwren)."
0,Manus Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox meeki,https://ebird.org/species/manhao1,"A medium-sized brown owl with a rounded head and yellow eyes. Head and upperparts dark brown, with indistinct scattered pale markings above. Chest and belly white with prominent dark streaking. Juvenile shows bolder pale markings above and less heavy streaking below. Occupies forest and more open areas with scattered trees. Confined to Manus. Distinctive: one of only two owl species present on Manus, the other being the very different Manus Masked-Owl, a type of barn-owl. Manus Boobok gives a frog-like song of repetitive rough, curt “grrr” notes."
0,Manus Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina ingens,https://ebird.org/species/whbcus4,"A fairly large gray bird with a heavy bill, a prominent black blotch between bill and eye, and a white underside. Found singly or in pairs in forest edges and open environments with trees, avoiding dense forest. The smaller Manus Cicadabird is the only other cuckooshrike in its limited range on the Admiralty Islands; the cuckooshrike can be distinguished from the cicadabird by its white belly. Gives “kitcheek” or “sh-zick” calls."
0,Manus Dwarf-Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Ceyx dispar,https://ebird.org/species/vardwk7,"A small blue-and-orange kingfisher with a bright waxy orange bill, ginger underparts, a white throat, and blue upperparts with a bright white neck spot. Female has a bright orange, not blue, head with a blue crown. Found in forest habitats, not necessarily near water, tolerating plantations and degraded forest. No other dwarf-kingfisher shares its range. Told from Common Kingfisher by smaller size and entirely red bill. Call apparently nearly identical that of other Melanesian dwarf-kingfishers: a high-pitched, weak repetitive whistle, often given in flight."

Bright rufous crown, back and rump. Black mask, wings and tail with white tip. White throat and black chest band with black dots below. Forages actively with tail cocked, fanned and wings drooped. The only other fantail in range is the Northern Fantail which has a gray rather than rufous back. Call, a sharp “pik!”. Song, a series of scratchy whistles."
0,Manus Masked-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Tytonidae,Tyto manusi,https://ebird.org/species/manowl2,"A very large, extremely poorly known barn-owl species confined to the island of Manus. The pale buff heart-shaped face is surrounded by a broad black border. The underside is buffy with scattered spots. Much darker above, with a patchwork of black and rusty brown areas and pale spots, including on the nape and crown. Assumed to be a forest owl, perhaps restricted to higher elevations. Few photos exist, and the vocalizations remain unconfirmed. Unmistakable: the only barn-owl on Manus."
0,Manus Monarch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Symposiachrus infelix,https://ebird.org/species/manmon1,"A medium-sized pied monarch with a mostly black head and chest and a large white ear patch.

0,Manx Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus puffinus,https://ebird.org/species/manshe,"Small black-and-white shearwater that flies with snappy wingbeats. Pay attention to its face pattern: typically quite dark and smudgy, with white curling up behind the cheek. Underwing is mostly white, sometimes with dark markings. Flies low to the water with quick wingbeats, almost recalling an alcid; occasionally arcs up high in strong wind. Prefers cooler ocean waters in the North and South Atlantic; rarely seen from land. Rare but seemingly increasing in the Pacific. Found singly or in small flocks, sometimes with other shearwaters. In Caribbean and western Atlantic, most similar to Audubon's Shearwater but shorter-tailed and darker-faced, with white under the tail."
0,New Zealand Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Oceanitidae,Fregetta maoriana,https://ebird.org/species/nezstp1,"Small seabird endemic to New Zealand. Dark blackish-brown head, breast, upperparts, and tail. Rump and belly white with variable dark streaking running down from breast. Underwings have pale panel with broad dark edge. Note especially long legs, with feet trailing well behind the square tail. Thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 2003 on Little Barrier Island, which remains the only known breeding location. At sea, recorded mostly around New Zealand’s northern waters. Four similar species: Wilson’s Storm-Petrel has dark underparts and underwing; Black-bellied Storm-Petrel is larger, with shorter legs that still extend past tail and with a white belly that has a black line down the middle; White-bellied Storm-Petrel is larger, with feet that do not extend past tail; Gray-backed Storm-Petrel does not have a white rump."
0,Maquis Canastero,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Asthenes heterura,https://ebird.org/species/maqcan1,"Slender and long-tailed canastero of the high Andes from Cochabamba, Bolivia south to NE Argentina. Prefers scrubby hillsides, ravines, and open Polylepis woodland above treeline. Distinguished from the more common Puna and Creamy-breasted Canasteros by lack of streaked back (from Puna) and brown cap and long, slender tail (from Creamy-breasted). Often in pairs or small family groups, though can be quite elusive. Song a rising series of slightly nasal whistles, each of which descends and the ascends rapidly in pitch: “tuwhee-tuwee-tuwhee-tuweeh-tee!”"
0,Marabou Stork,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Leptoptilos crumenifer,https://ebird.org/species/marsto1,"This huge, macabre-looking stork has a massive dagger-like bill and naked pink head and neck that appear severely sunburned. A white ruff and loose inflatable skin on the neck add to its odd appearance. It soars effortlessly at great heights searching for food; note its white belly in flight. Marabous are equally content in wetlands or in dry bush; they are most frequently encountered lurking near carrion, as they attend kills of major predators and will opportunistically snatch scraps. They also readily scavenge around humans and waste dumps."
0,Marail Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope marail,https://ebird.org/species/margua1,"Medium-sized guan of rainforest canopy. Usually appears entirely dark; note short-legged profile, contrasting red throat patch, and sluggish behavior. Slips quietly through canopy, feeding on fruit; typically found alone or in pairs but may congregate at fruiting trees. Generally wary, especially where hunted, but sometimes tolerates close approach. May be seen near the ground at forest edge or along roadsides. Very similar to Spix’s Guan; Marail is smaller and shorter-legged, but this can be surprisingly difficult to judge accurately."
0,Marbled Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Podargus ocellatus,https://ebird.org/species/marfro1,"Large, nocturnal bird with very wide ""frog-like"" bill, an inhabitant of rainforest habitats. Compared to similar Tawny Frogmouth (often found in urban and suburban areas), Marbled has longer tail in proportion to its body, longer barred tufts above the bill, and a more blobby or marbled pattern on the underparts. Unusual call is a descending, turkey-like gobble, followed by a loud snap of the bill."
0,Marbled Godwit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Limosa fedoa,https://ebird.org/species/margod,"Large, buffy shorebird with exceptionally long, upturned, bicolored bill. Overall warm coloration, especially bright on the wings in flight, helps separate from other godwits. Similar in color to Long-billed Curlew, but obviously different bill shape and darker legs. Breeds in wet prairies. During migration and winter, found in a variety of shallow wetlands, especially mudflats, beaches, and estuaries. Often in flocks with other large shorebirds like Willet and Whimbrel."
0,Marbled Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Pycnopygius cinereus,https://ebird.org/species/marhon1,"A medium-sized honeyeater of mid-mountain oak forest and adjacent secondary areas. Upperparts olive, underparts gray with mottling and some streaking on the crown. Note distinctive white crescents beneath the eye and on the cheek.

Voice, an often repeated, whistled “chirrup!” or more musical, wrenlike “chii-pi-dup!”."
0,Marbled Murrelet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Brachyramphus marmoratus,https://ebird.org/species/marmur,"Small seabird that breeds in old-growth evergreen forests, sometimes far from the coast. Often in small flocks on coastal waters, where it dives underwater searching for fish. Breeding plumage is dark brown with few contrasting marks; slightly darker cap and blotchy pale belly. Nonbreeding birds are sharply patterned black, white, and gray. Note black cap that extends below the eye, a white collar, and dark grayish pattern on back. Bill is very short and thin. Similar to several other species of murrelets and difficult to distinguish without good views, but note details of face pattern and range."
0,Marbled Wood-Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Odontophorus gujanensis,https://ebird.org/species/mawqua1,"Plump chickenlike bird, stout bill, brown overall with diagnostic red skin around the eye. Grayer on nape with some fine buffy markings on the rest of the body. Found in small flocks, always on the ground, foraging through leaf litter in the forest. More often heard than seen: listen for the low rich rolling calls, often given by multiple birds at once."
0,Marcapata Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cranioleuca marcapatae,https://ebird.org/species/marspi2,"Fairly small, long-tailed bird found in a small range in the Peruvian Andes. Reddish brown above, pale tan below, with a pale eyebrow edged in black and a variably colored crown. In the eastern part of its range, the crown is reddish brown; in its northwestern populations, the crown is creamy white. Has a bolder whitish throat and eyebrow than the similar Ash-browed Spinetail, which is typically found at lower elevations. Marcapata Spinetail forages in low vegetation in cloud forest, especially in thick bamboo. Listen for its song, a descending series of staccato, metallic notes."

Similar to Papuan King-Parrot with little overlap, but Moluccan lacks the pale green shoulder bar of the male and green head of the female. Somewhat similar to Chattering Lory but Moluccan King-Parrot has a blue rather than red back and a longer tail. Gives clear, high-pitched, upslurred piping and harsh scolding calls."
0,Moluccan Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus magicus,https://ebird.org/species/mosowl1,"A small owl with ear tufts, a black facial border, yellow eyes, prominent black streaking on pale underside, and intricately patterned upperparts with conspicuous white wing markings. Occurs in gray and rufous forms. Adult’s crown is streaked; juvenile’s is barred. Inhabits forest and plantations within lowlands and foothills. On some islands, overlaps with Wallace’s and Flores Scops-Owls. There, smaller Moluccan is best separated by voice from Wallace’s, but can be distinguished from Flores Scops-Owl by dark crown, dark bill, and bold streaking on the underside. Call is a distinctive frog-like croak."
0,Moluccan Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Aplonis mysolensis,https://ebird.org/species/molsta1,"A dingy, entirely blackish starling with a long graduated tail and a dark eye. Juvenile shorter-tailed and browner than adult, with streaks below. Gregarious, often found in noisy groups, occurring in a variety of wooded habitats within the lowlands and foothills. Duller than Metallic Starling, with a dark eye and a shorter tail. Vocalizations include metallic “zip” and whining “weeer” call notes. Song is a bold set of uneven “glee-gloo-glee-gloo” notes."
0,Moluccan Woodcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Scolopax rochussenii,https://ebird.org/species/molwoo1,"A chunky, snipe-like forest-dwelling shorebird with cryptic plumage, a stunted tail, and a long powerful bill. Buff below with extensive bold black markings above. Largely occupies the floor of lowland and foothills forests. Best seen in crepuscular display flights above the canopy, when its heavy body, short tail, heavily checkered broad underwings, and long bill can be noted. Confined to islands of Obi and Bacan, where it is the only woodcock. In display flight, frequently repeats a distinctive short, wet rattle, “titilit.”"
0,Mombasa Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campethera mombassica,https://ebird.org/species/momwoo1,"An attractive medium-sized woodpecker with a lightly speckled olive-green back and black-striped pale underparts. Males have a red crown, nape, and moustache streak; females have a spotted dark green crown and a red nape. Both sexes have a pale, lightly speckled throat. Found in coastal forest and moist woodland. Similar to Golden-tailed Woodpecker, but there is virtually no overlap in range, and Mombasa is easily distinguished by the pale throat and the spotted rather than barred back. Fairly similar to Reichenow’s Woodpecker, but distinguished by the striped rather than spotted breast. The vocalizations include a repeated “kree” call and a raspy, trilled “krrrrr.”"
0,Mongolian Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Bucanetes mongolicus,https://ebird.org/species/monfin2,"A pale, large-billed finch found in dry areas with sparse plant cover. Usually seen in small and medium-sized groups. Pinkish hues make it superficially similar to rosefinches, but it is much paler overall with very different patterning. Male is brown with a pink blush on the brow, rump, breast, and wings. Females are pale gray-brown with much fainter, almost unnoticeable, pink. White wing stripes flash brightly in flight."
0,Mongolian Short-toed Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Calandrella dukhunensis,https://ebird.org/species/sstlar4,"A small lark with a short, conical bill. It appears long and horizontal, and has strong streaks on the upperparts. Very similar to Greater Short-toed Lark, but Sykes’s is slightly larger, is warmer brown with a rust-colored tinge on the breast and underparts, and has bolder streaking. It usually inhabits open, dry grassy habitats. Song is a prolonged melodious jumble of notes, often given in flight. Calls, often heard when individuals or flocks go overhead, are distinctly trilly, with a squeaky-wet quality to them: “tr’liu, tr’liu, liu, liu”; not as strong and insistent-sounding as the calls of Greater Short-toed Lark."
0,Monk Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Myiopsitta monachus,https://ebird.org/species/monpar,"Native to South America, where it is found in various open habitats, especially rural agricultural areas and towns.

0,Monotonous Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra passerina,https://ebird.org/species/monlar2,"A medium-small, compact lark with a small bill, a plain face, and an indistinct eyebrow. It has streaky upperparts with a distinct rufous wing panel and a lightly-streaked buffy chest that separates the white throat from the pale belly. Its movement patterns are poorly understood; it is nomadic, appearing unpredictably in large numbers to breed after rain. The male sits on perches, incessantly singing a croaking, gurgling, distinctive four-note “for-syrup-is-sweet” song every 3-5 seconds for hours on end, day and night, earning it its name. When singing, the male stretches its neck, puffs out its whitish throat feathers, and raises a small crest. Occasionally the male rises up 5-10 meters in the air on rapidly flapping wings, sings, and parachutes back down to a prominent perch. The similar Latakoo Lark is smaller than the Monotonous Lark, with a bolder facial pattern including an eyebrow, and a different song and display."
0,Montagu's Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus pygargus,https://ebird.org/species/monhar1,"Lightly built hawk with rather narrow and somewhat tapered wings. Favors heathland, grassland, arable fields, marshes. Mainly seen in flight, quartering fairly low with wings raised in shallow V; flight rather buoyant. Male pale gray overall with black wingtips (can be confused with a gull); note narrow black bar on upperwing. Female told from Hen Harrier by narrower wings, more buoyant flight; juvenile bright rusty below. Some individuals are very dark overall. Pallid Harrier males lack the black wing bars and rusty traces on the underparts of their Montagu's counterparts, while Pallid females and juveniles average far paler in the face."
0,Montane Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Lepidocolaptes lacrymiger,https://ebird.org/species/monwoo1,"Fairly small and slender woodcreeper found in Andean subtropical zone from Venezuela to Bolivia. Warm brown overall, with rufous wings and tail. Distinct white streaking on underparts, white throat, and white eyebrow.

Like other woodcreepers, hitches up tree trunks and large limbs."
0,Monte Yellow-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sicalis mendozae,https://ebird.org/species/monyef1,"Small yellow terrestrial finch-like tanager of the Monte desert of central Argentina. Distinguished from most other Yellow-finches by its uniform bright yellow underparts, and from Saffron Finch by Monte Yellow-Finch’s larger bill and lack of orange in forecrown."
0,Monteiro's Bushshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Malaconotus monteiri,https://ebird.org/species/monbus1,"A large, robust bushshrike with a massive head, a chunky hook-tipped bill, and a gray eye and head; a white patch on the face often extends above and below the eye. Wings are green, spotted with yellow. Pairs skulk at middle levels and in the canopy of montane and gallery forest and plantation edges, seldom joining flocks. The species forages slowly and deliberately, hopping along branches, diligently searching for food. Gray-headed Bushshrike, which prefers savanna, differs from the larger Monteiro’s by having pale yellow eyes and a white facial patch that is restricted to the area between the eye and bill base. Monteiro’s gives a low-pitched extended sorrowful “whhooooooo” song repeatedly, along with various harsh clicks and rasps."
0,Monteiro's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Tockus monteiri,https://ebird.org/species/monhor1,"Brown hornbill with a white belly and a yellow-and-orange bill. The white outer tail feathers and wing patches are conspicuous in flight. Found in arid savanna. Usually solitary or in pairs; sometimes in small flocks. Call is a series of clucking notes that accelerates and becomes louder. Fairly similar to Bradfield’s Hornbill, but has white in the wings, much more white in the tail, and a yellow base to the bill."
0,Monteiro's Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates monteiroi,https://ebird.org/species/monstp1,"Very similar to Band-rumped Storm-Petrel, and closely related to it. Both taxa differ mainly in timing of breeding and subsequent wing molt: Monteiro's Storm-Petrel breeds in summer and molt post-breeding, while Band-rumped breeds in winter and molts in winter. Morphologically they are very similar, however Monteiro's has on average a longer and more deeply-forked tail. Breeds in burrows and crevices on islands."
0,Montezuma Oropendola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Psarocolius montezuma,https://ebird.org/species/monoro1,"Spectacular, very large ‘blackbird’ of tropical lowlands. Favors forest edge, open woodland, plantations, semi-open areas with trees; colonies of large pendulous nests adorn tall trees. Male is much larger than female, but sexes look similar: dark rusty overall with a black head, bold yellow sides to the tail, and ornate face and bill patterning. Flies rather directly, with slow, ‘rowing’ wingbeats. Memorable gurgling song sounds like water poured from a bottle."
0,Montezuma Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Cyrtonyx montezumae,https://ebird.org/species/monqua,"A remarkably patterned quail, uncommon and difficult to spot as it runs through open grassy woodlands in dry regions of the southwest U.S. and Mexico. Male looks like he’s are wearing a black-and-white helmet; otherwise look for bold spots and streaks covering body and wings. Female is more subtly patterned with shades of brown; look for rounded, puffy head shape. Between bursts of running, often crouches motionless and becomes nearly invisible. Rarely flies unless flushed at very close range; most often seen crossing a road or trail. Male song is a rich descending whistle with unique ethereal tone like an incoming spaceship."
0,Montserrat Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus oberi,https://ebird.org/species/monori1,"A slim species of mountain forests where it feeds on insects at middle elevation.

0,Moreau's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris moreaui,https://ebird.org/species/morsun2,"A medium-sized sunbird. Males are very colorful, with a shining coppery-green iridescence on the head and back and a purple-and-red breast band with yellow sides. Females are drab yellowish-brown. Found locally in montane forest, especially clearings and forest edge. Similar to Forest Double-collared Sunbird, but there is only minor overlap in range, and males are separated by their broad yellow sides. The calls include a squeaky “tseet” that often precedes a very quick jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Morelet's Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sporophila morelleti,https://ebird.org/species/whcsee1,"Fairly common little bird of grassland and weedy areas in the tropical lowlands and foothills. Occurs from Texas to Panama. Often in flocks, mixing readily with other “weed-eating” small birds. Plumage is very variable, but all birds have a stubby dark bill with a curved culmen. Usually shows two whitish wingbars. Breeding plumage males with a black cap and bold white collar are usually outnumbered by female-plumaged birds, which are plain brownish, sometimes showing buffy wingbars."
0,Morepork,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox novaeseelandiae,https://ebird.org/species/morepo2,"Small brownish owl with dark ‘glasses’ surrounding eyes. Fairly common in a wide variety of habitats in Tasmania and New Zealand.

Range of the northern subspecies overlaps slightly with that of Yunnan Fulvetta, from which it can be distinguished by duller, more olive-green upperparts, a bolder black line above the eye, and colder gray-washed underparts. Southern subspecies, found in peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand, is richer brown above with a whiter belly. Fast twittering song is comparable to that of Yunnan Fulvetta but somewhat quicker and shorter. Dry churring rattles are likewise similar to those of Yunnan Fulvetta. Despite its name, does not necessarily inhabit higher altitudes than Yunnan Fulvetta, and altitudinal ranges do overlap."
0,Cameroon Mountain Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Arizelocichla montana,https://ebird.org/species/camgre2,"A medium-sized greenbul of the mountains of Cameroon and southeastern Nigeria. Remarkably uniform yellow-olive in plumage, with a red eye. Found in montane forest, secondary habitat, and scrub. Feeds in the understory and at middle levels of the forest. Somewhat similar to Western Mountain Greenbul, but easily separated by the lack of a gray head and contrasting white eye crescents. Might be confused with Cameroon Olive-Greenbul, but separated by brighter coloration overall and an olive-green rather than reddish-brown tail.

0,Mountain Illadopsis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pellorneidae,Illadopsis pyrrhoptera,https://ebird.org/species/mouill1,"Chunky, mid-sized, remarkably drab bird. Found in the understory of montane forest, usually in small groups. Very shy and skulking, rarely seen unless expressly searched for. Most often detected by voice: a descending series of whistles, usually given together by a group of birds, some of which add lower “chuk” notes. Similar to African Hill Babbler, but has a dull-brown rather than rich rufous-brown back. Also very similar to other illadopsises, but generally found at higher elevations, and has a less distinct white throat."
0,Mountain Imperial-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula badia,https://ebird.org/species/moipig1,"Large elegant pearl-gray pigeon with dark wings.

0,Mountain Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus hoeschi,https://ebird.org/species/moupip1,"A large, dark, boldly marked pipit with a pinkish base to the bill. Pairs breed in alpine scrub and grassland above 2000 meters of elevation from October to April, before dispersing to wintering grounds presumed to be in Central Africa. It runs between bushes foraging on the ground, and occasionally perches up to sing. It has a long undulating display flight; the flight call is a 2-syllable “chiREE,” slower and deeper than other pipits. The similar African Pipit differs from the Mountain Pipit by having a yellow (not pink) base to the bill, white (not buff) outer tail feathers, and less heavily marked plumage. The Long-billed Pipit is more slender, with a longer tail and a less boldly marked face, back, and chest."

0,Mountain Serin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Chrysocorythus estherae,https://ebird.org/species/mouser1,"Rare and localized highland finch, restricted to upper montane forest and open scrubby and grassy habitats above the treeline. Generally not very obvious, often foraging quietly in dense growth, but flocks will sometimes betray their presence by flying overhead and giving a chorus of chittering twitter calls. Found only on high peaks in Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and Mindanao. Combination of thick conical bill, bright yellow wing-bars, and well-streaked underparts are unique within this species’ range and habitat. Extent of yellow on males’ faces varies, with the Mindanao population having the most extensive yellow. A currently undescribed population in north-central Sulawesi has reddish-orange in place of other populations’ yellow patches. Song is a dry, whirring buzz following a few husky notes."

Listen for its song, a series of high, distinct piping whistles: “hi-hee-hu-huh-hi” or variants thereof. Can be quite inquisitive, allowing close approach; look for a small chunky brown bird with elegant pale eyebrows, an overall brown body with strong streaking, and a contrasting pale throat. Eyebrowed Wren-Babbler overlaps marginally in range but averages lower in elevational preference; it also has white spots on the wings and a different song."

Intricately patterned with brown, black, and white. Compare with Andean Snipe; Noble is paler overall with an unmarked white belly, more obvious white stripes on the upperparts, and a longer bill. Scarce; usually seen singly in marshes or bogs in páramo, often only when flushed."
0,Nocturnal Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Nothocrax urumutum,https://ebird.org/species/noccur1,"This small curassow is entirely warm brown with a bright orange bill, yellow skin above the eye, and gray skin below the eye. True to its name, it is strictly nocturnal and thus extremely difficult to see. It is much more often detected by voice: listen for a low, booming song typically with three notes. With a great deal of effort and luck, a singing individual might be spotted perched in the canopy. Occurs in lowland forest in western Amazonia, where it typically stays in the upper levels, rarely dropping to the ground."
0,Noisy Friarbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Philemon corniculatus,https://ebird.org/species/noifri1,"Large gray-brown honeyeater with a completely bare black head and a distinctive ""horn"" on the bill. Upperparts are gray and underparts are dull white. Completely bare head is unique among the friarbirds. Typically very loud; emits a variety of harsh, loud squawks.

0,Noisy Miner,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Manorina melanocephala,https://ebird.org/species/noimin1,"A medium to large, gray honeyeater with a black crown, a yellow bill, and a yellow eye patch. Aggressive and territorial; lives in colonies and vigorously defends territories against pretty much anything that moves. Common in urban areas, as well as in many open forested and agricultural landscapes. In inland areas, take note of the black crown; the similar looking Yellow-throated Miner has a pale gray crown. Noisy Miners are distributed across much of eastern Australia."
0,Noisy Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Pitta versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/noipit1,"A distinctive bird with a chestnut crown. This species has green and black wings, dull yellow underparts, a black facial stripe, a bright blue shoulder patch, and a red patch under the tail. A very colorful species, it can although be inconspicuous while it hops around foraging on forest floors. Primarily found in rainforest, this species undertakes seasonal movements and can be found very close to the coast (including in mangroves) during winter. It is usually seen before it is heard: its call, a loud, well-known “walk to work”, is a typical sound of rainforests within its range. Sometimes calls from high in the canopy."
0,Nonggang Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Timaliidae,Stachyris nonggangensis,https://ebird.org/species/nonbab1,"A medium-sized brown babbler with pale eyes and a lopsided white crescent bordering the back half of the cheek. Short-tailed and large-headed in profile. Dark coloration and relatively simple head markings make this species unique in its very restricted range. Highly selective in its habitat requirements: found only in seasonal karst-dominated rainforests, where it moves about in noisy flocks."
0,Nordmann's Greenshank,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa guttifer,https://ebird.org/species/norgre1,"Rare and declining Asian shorebird.

0,Norfolk Island Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Cyanoramphus cookii,https://ebird.org/species/noipar1,"Chunky medium-sized green parrot with a bright red forehead and broken line through the eye. Also note electric blue wing lining. One of only two parrots on Norfolk Island; compare with immature Crimson Rosella, which is much longer-tailed and differs in overall coloration. Inhabits remaining native forests on Norfolk Island. Gives noisy nasal yammering calls. Previously very rare, but active conservation management has restored numbers."
0,Noronha Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia ridleyana,https://ebird.org/species/norela1,"The only flycatcher on the island of Fernando de Noronha. Olive-brown above, paler below, with three white wingbars. Occurs in wooded habitats throughout the island. Call is a series of fluted notes “thiu.” The Noronha Vireo has a very different shape and is smaller with a white eyebrow."
0,Noronha Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo gracilirostris,https://ebird.org/species/norvir1,"Endemic to the island of Fernando de Noronha, where it is one of only two native songbirds. Has an olive-gray back and buffy-white underparts, recalling the reed warblers of the Old World. Note the buff eyebrow and dark eyes. Found in wooded habitat throughout the island, where it forages at all levels. The song is a musical ""weet a weet, chewegoo, whit, whit""."
0,North Island Brown Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx mantelli,https://ebird.org/species/nibkiw1,"A large, dark grayish brown kiwi with reddish brown streaking. The only kiwi found in the wild on the mainland of New Zealand’s North Island. Found in both native and exotic forest, scrub, and neighboring farmland. More often heard than seen. Male call is a series of clear rising whistles. Female call is a harsh throaty wail. Both sexes repeat their call many times. Often heard at night foraging as it sniffs loudly, tapping the ground for invertebrates. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,North Island Piopio,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Turnagra tanagra,https://ebird.org/species/noipio1,"Extinct, last reported in 1902."
0,North Island Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Petroica longipes,https://ebird.org/species/nezrob2,"A small charcoal-colored songbird endemic to New Zealand. Confined to central North Island and a few offshore predator-free islands. Favors mature native and exotic forest stands. Male is almost all black with a white spot above the bill. Female and juvenile grayer, with lighter patches on breast and throat. Can be incredibly confiding and curious about humans. It is possible to bring individuals out into the open by disturbing leaf litter and then sitting quietly. Actively flushes out prey with foot trembling and by flicking its wings and tail. Male song is a loud and simple phrase of notes including “pwee-pwee-pwee.”"
0,North Island Saddleback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Callaeidae,Philesturnus rufusater,https://ebird.org/species/saddle2,"A medium-sized songbird endemic to New Zealand, confined to predator-free offshore islands and North Island mainland sanctuaries. Glossy black plumage with distinct chestnut saddle across the back, which gives the bird its name. Note the bright reddish-orange wattles on either side of the bill. Juveniles lack the shine in plumage and show dusty brown tips to the black body feathers and smaller wattles. The species is often heard before it is seen, with loud vocalizations resembling a blaring “cheet te-te-te-te.” Constantly moves noisily as it restlessly forages on the floor and through the canopy. Flicks over leaves and digs into rotting logs with its strong bill in search of invertebrates. Distinguished from Eurasian Blackbird by chestnut saddle and wattles."

0,Northern Bentbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Oncostoma cinereigulare,https://ebird.org/species/norben1,"Tiny flycatcher of humid forest and woodland in tropical lowlands. Inconspicuous, mainly foraging at low to mid-levels in forest interior and edge, where flits from perch to perch and then sits still. Heard far more often than seen: common call a low, frog-like churr. Overall plumage color and pattern much like many flycatchers, but note its tiny size, ‘broken-nose’ bill profile, pale eyes, and relatively long, thin, pale pinkish legs."
0,Northern Black-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis edolioides,https://ebird.org/species/nobfly1,"A slim, long-tailed all-black flycatcher with a dark eye. Found in savanna, woodland, and cultivated areas. Single birds or pairs sit out on conspicuous perches, sometimes quite low. Very similar to Southern Black-Flycatcher, but there is virtually no overlap in range, and Northern lacks gloss in the black plumage. Distinguished from drongos by the slimmer bill and dark brown eye. Could be confused with certain black cuckooshrikes or boubous, but has a more vertical posture, and sits motionless for much longer periods. Not very vocal, but does have a pretty song of various trills, wheezes, and whistles given with long pauses between phrases."
0,Northern Bobwhite,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Colinus virginianus,https://ebird.org/species/norbob,"Small and rotund with intricate brown, black, and white patterning. Some striking variation in plumage across range. Most males, including those in the eastern U.S., have bold black and white head pattern and heavy white spotting on belly. In Mexico, males can be entirely cinnamon-colored below and have a fully black head; some might have a white eyebrow or a dark chest band. Females are more consistent throughout range: look for buffy throat and eyebrow. Pairs or small groups are found in scrubby fields and brushy woods.

The tail is rufous and the throat paler buff. Found in scrub, thickets, and areas of dense woodland, almost always in small and vocal groups. The loud calls are rollicking series of babbling calls, somewhat similar to both woodhoopoe and babbler vocalizations. Very similar to Terrestrial Brownbul, but throat patch is much duller instead of bright white, and tail is more rufous. Also similar to Fischer’s Greenbul, but has dark rather than pale eyes. Separated from other greenbuls by the lack of olive-green in the plumage."
0,Northern Cardinal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Cardinalis cardinalis,https://ebird.org/species/norcar,"Striking and familiar backyard bird throughout most of eastern North America; also occurs in the southwestern U.S. and fairly extensively in Mexico.

Forms flocks from late summer through winter, locally in hundreds or even thousands. Boldly patterned plumage looks black and white overall, but back shows green gloss in good light. Flies with deep, rather floppy wingbeats and dives steeply in breeding display; wingtips notably broad and rounded, not pointed like most waders."
0,Northern Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus taeniopterus,https://ebird.org/species/nomwea1,"A fairly small, slim weaver with a chunky bill. Always shows a dark bill and eye. Breeding male is distinctive, with bright yellow overall plumage and a black mask that grades into chestnut at its edges. Females, non-breeding males, and juveniles are much duller, but show streaking on the back and pale underparts. Found mainly in wetlands, though the species will range into surrounding dry savanna. Almost always found in flocks. Plumages other than the breeding male’s can be hard to separate from other weavers, but can be cautiously identified by the dark bill and eye, fairly pale overall coloration, and size and shape. Vocalizations are typical of weavers: “chek” notes and a sizzling “radio static” song."
0,Northern Mockingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus polyglottos,https://ebird.org/species/normoc,"Gray with whitish underparts and long tail. In flight, it becomes much flashier with large white patches on the black wings and tail. Pale eye.

0,Oilbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Steatornithidae,Steatornis caripensis,https://ebird.org/species/oilbir1,"This bizarre nocturnal fruit-eating bird is unlikely to be mistaken. It is entirely rufous-brown with small white spots on the wings, tail, and body. The pinkish bill is strongly hooked. Sexes similar. Breeds and roosts in colonies in caves or steep dark ravines. Difficult to find away from a known colony. Occasionally seen flying over the forest canopy at dawn or dusk, when it can be told from other crepuscular birds like nighthawks by its larger size, bulkier shape, and floppier flight style. Occurs from the lowlands up into the subtropical zone in the Andes, occasionally straying even higher. Makes a variety of strange clicking and shrieking noises."
0,Okarito Brown Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx rowi,https://ebird.org/species/okbkiw1,"A large, dark grayish brown kiwi with brownish streaking, often showing white patches on face. Restricted to native forest near Okarito in New Zealand, with small populations on predator-free Mana, Blumine, and Motuara islands. Often heard at night foraging as it sniffs loudly, tapping the ground for invertebrates. Male call is a series of clear rising whistles. Female call is a harsh throaty wail. Both sexes repeat their call many times, and sometimes call simultaneously. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Okinawa Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallirallus okinawae,https://ebird.org/species/okirai1,"A candy-red bill, curving white head stripe, and lacey black-and-white striping make this a unique and attractive species.

Call is a high-pitched rising “tseee!” and the song is a complex jumble of clear whistles and buzzy notes."
0,Olivaceous Greenlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Hylophilus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/oligre1,"A small, vociferous vireo of east Andean cloud forest. Yellow underparts and crown, pale eye, and pinkish bill help separate it from other species in range. Usually stays high in the trees and sometimes follows mixed-species flocks. Sings frequently, belting out a squeaky and sometimes monotonous series of notes such as “twee-twee-twee…” or “soowe-soowe-soowe …”"
0,Olivaceous Piculet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picumnus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/olipic1,"Tiny woodpecker somewhat reminiscent of a nuthatch.

0,Olive Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Xenopipo uniformis,https://ebird.org/species/oliman2,"An inconspicuous, small, green bird of the tepui highlands. Key marks are entirely olive-green plumage and yellowish eyering. Inhabits humid, mossy forest undergrowth on tepui slopes, most commonly above 800 m but occasionally lower. Generally solitary, quiet, and easily overlooked; most likely to be seen feeding at fruiting shrubs. Calls include a high, wheezing note that may rise and fall in pitch. Distinctive eyering should easily separate this species from other manakins at higher elevations in the tepuis. Below 800 m, told from Olivaceous Schiffornis by smaller size, shorter tail, and strongly olive-green plumage. Told from female Black Manakin by eyering and olive plumage."
0,Olive Oropendola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Psarocolius bifasciatus,https://ebird.org/species/olioro1,"Large, dark oropendola of mature rainforest. Olive green with reddish brown wings and a bright yellow tail. Bill is black with colorful pink patch at the base and an orange tip.

0,Olive-backed Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mitrospingidae,Mitrospingus oleagineus,https://ebird.org/species/olbtan1,"A bulky bird of tepui highlands, often encountered in groups. Unlikely to be confused within its limited range; plumage mostly coppery-olive (may tend toward yellow in sunlight) with a contrasting gray face and throat. Stout bill is silvery gray. Occurs in canopy of tepui highland forest, generally above 800 m, where groups forage noisily through vegetation, probing into epiphytes and dead leaves and hopping clumsily along branches, eating whatever is in their path. Frequents fruiting trees, and may join mixed-species flocks but are just as likely to be found away from them. Most typical call is a dreadful high-pitched screech, modulated as if the bird is being squeezed, and sounding quite literally like fingernails on a chalkboard."
0,Olive Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/olithr2,"A typical thrush with olive-brown upperparts and rufous underparts. Its taxonomic status remains under review, and it is most easily identified by range. In the north it is primarily a species of montane forest and forest edge, but farther south it occurs in gardens, woodland, plantations, and heath. It has a varied song, and often reveals its presence with typical thrush “chk-chk” or thin “tseeep” calls. An understory specialist that sometimes skulks, but at other times can be quite bold. Most similar thrushes do not overlap geographically. One that does is the Karoo Thrush, which differs from Olive Thrush in its gray (not rufous) flanks; its yellow-orange (not brown) eye-ring; its yellow (not dark brown) base to the upper mandible of the bill; and its less streaky throat."

0,Oriente Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Teretistridae,Teretistris fornsi,https://ebird.org/species/oriwar1,"A noisy flocking species that uses a wide variety of wooded and scrubby habitats. Its combination of blue-gray upperparts, yellow from throat to upper belly, and gray lower belly eliminate all other species in range. The similar Yellow-headed Warbler has a yellow crown and a gray chest. The Prothonotary Warbler has a greenish or yellow crown and a green back. Calls include a relatively high and buzzy “zip” or “zhip” and a rather sharp, but slighty buzzy “tip”; both typically given in a somewhat rapid series. Song is a jumbled combination of these and similar notes."
0,Orinoco Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Oressochen jubatus,https://ebird.org/species/origoo1,"Small goose of seasonally flooded grasslands and rainforest rivers. Two-toned, with a brown body and cream-colored head, neck, and breast. The wings are dark iridescent green, with a small white patch visible in flight.

0,Pacific Golden-Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Pluvialis fulva,https://ebird.org/species/pagplo,"Slender plover spangled with gold. Breeding plumage shows black belly and face with mottled white sides and undertail coverts and a white stripe down the side of the neck that continues onto the sides of the chest and flanks. Nonbreeding plumage is duller grayish-brown overall with a variable golden wash, often quite bright. Juveniles are crisp and neatly spangled above, washed with gold on the upperparts. At all seasons, note more slender shape, slightly smaller bill, and brighter golden tones than Black-bellied Plover, along with grayish underwing in flight. Extremely similar to American Golden-Plover; Pacific is slightly shorter-winged, longer-legged, and larger-billed, but these features are difficult to judge. Juvenile Pacific is usually brighter than American, especially on the face and neck. Pacific found more regularly on beaches and mudflats than American, but much overlap; also note range. Breeds on Arctic tundra from Alaska to Russia. Winters extensively across Southeast Asia, the South Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand; small numbers found in fall on west coast of U.S. Note voice: a quick “pip” note followed by a rising “plooEEP!”, first note shorter and more clipped than Black-bellied.

Frequently perches on telephone lines, often with other swallow species."
0,Pacific Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus pacificus,https://ebird.org/species/fotswi,"A large dark swift with origami-like angularity in flight profile. Black overall with a slightly paler throat and a bright white rump patch. Long forked tail is prominent in flight and is often opened while the bird is banking. Migrates in enormous flocks, which give sharp trilling calls in flight. The only large “fork-tailed swift” in its range, but compare with Cook's, Blyth's, and Salim Ali's Swifts where ranges overlap."
0,Pacific Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Troglodytes pacificus,https://ebird.org/species/pacwre1,"Most easily recognized by its incredible voice; complex, high-pitched whistled song rings through dense, moss-covered forests. Not as impressive to see as it is to hear. Very small, dark brown, with short tail often cocked upright. Western counterpart of Winter Wren (formerly considered one species). Two species barely overlap in range. Note differences in song and darker, warmer plumage of Pacific."

All birds have a bi-colored bill with a curve to the tip of the upper bill. The breast is streaked and the upperparts have variable amounts of streaking. Juveniles show distinct and dark mottling on the upperparts. It is common in open habitats such as wetlands, farms, fields, and even large parks. Very similar to Blyth’s and Richard’s Pipits, but relatively compact and has a more distinct eyebrow, fainter or no streaking on the back of the neck, a larger head, and a shorter tail than either Blyth’s or Richard’s. Calls include short “tsip” and “tissip” notes."
0,Paddyfield Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus agricola,https://ebird.org/species/padwar1,"Warm brown above and pale below; strong dark eyestripe contrasts with white eyebrow. Smallish reed warbler with long and strongly rounded tail, short bill with dark tip, and short primary projection. Difficult to separate visually from other small Acrocephalus warblers, especially Blunt-winged Warbler; note Paddyfield’s more prominent pale eyebrow which strengthens behind the eye, as well as longer-winged appearance. Also compare with Iduna warblers. Breeds in extensive reed beds; in nonbreeding season found in marshes, but also more scrubby areas. Distinctive, melodious song."

0,Painted Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Passerina ciris,https://ebird.org/species/paibun,"Incomparably beautiful songbird in which adult males are almost too colorful, with a jarring combination of rich blue head, bright red underparts, and lime green back. Females and immature males are plain green and unstreaked, not brown-toned like other buntings. Breeds in shrubby fields and forest edges, where males often sing from a high exposed perch. Found in a variety of weedy or thickety habitats in winter, often in small flocks that like to stay low and hidden. Sometimes visits feeders. Two disjunct populations look and sound very similar, but have different migration routes. Eastern birds, mainly breeding in Georgia and South Carolina, just migrate south to Florida and the Caribbean for the winter. Larger western population centered in Texas migrates to western Mexico and then filters south through Central America."

0,Pardusco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Nephelornis oneilli,https://ebird.org/species/pardus2,"An odd, warbler-like bird found near treeline in the Andes of northern and central Peru. Pardusco means “brownish” in Spanish, and that fits the bird very well. It is best identified by its lack of field marks, its small and pointy bill, and its specialized habitat. Behavior is also a good clue, as it is typically found in little flocks that chatter and squeak as they move through elfin forest, often accompanied by other species."

0,Patagonian Forest Earthcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Upucerthia saturatior,https://ebird.org/species/pafear1,"Rather local breeder in drier Patagonian areas with open forest and shrubby slopes. Migrates across the Andes to winter in Chile, where it is found in matorral and other shrubby habitats. Often rather skulking. Very similar to Scale-throated Earthcreeper of the Andes and southern Patagonia, but limited range overlap. Patagonian Forest Earthcreeper averages darker with bolder pale eyebrow, slightly shorter and darker bill, and a different song. Also compare with Buff-winged Cinclodes, which has shorter and straight bill."
0,Patagonian Mockingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus patagonicus,https://ebird.org/species/patmoc1,"Fairly common in Argentine Patagonia, but local and scarce in southern Chile. Favors semiopen habitats, from shrub-steppe to farmland with hedges and shrubby patches. Often perches atop bushes and on roadside wires and posts. Runs well on the ground, usually with tail cocked; at times can be rather elusive, skulking in bushes. Identified by bold pale eyebrow, buffy-gray underparts, white wingbars, and white tail corners; compare with White-banded Mockingbird, which has much more white in wings and tail."

Despite the name, not really a bird of dry Patagonian habitats. Often in groups, especially in winter, and feeds from the ground to high in trees. Male has a gray hood and distinctive golden back. Female and immature are similar to Gray-hooded Sierra-Finch, but are more extensively yellow below and the whisker marks are weaker."
0,Patagonian Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Tinamotis ingoufi,https://ebird.org/species/pattin1,"Large, cryptically patterned chickenlike bird of Patagonian grasslands with bushes and low shrubs. Scarce and rarely encountered. Like related tinamous of open habitats, most often in trios or family groups (males take care of the young). Runs strongly in preference to flying (in flight note bright rusty wings). Striped head (without a crest) and spotted upperparts are diagnostic plumage features; only other tinamou in its range is the rather different Elegant Crested-Tinamou. Loud haunting whistles carry well, but the sound is easily whipped away in the wind."
0,Patagonian Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Colorhamphus parvirostris,https://ebird.org/species/pattyr2,"Rather plain but subtly attractive little flycatcher best known in migration and winter, when it occurs widely in gardens, parks, and open woodlands, often with fruiting shrubs.

0,Pincoya Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Oceanitidae,Oceanites pincoyae,https://ebird.org/species/pumstp1,"Very local in inshore marine waters near Puerto Montt, Chile, where it can be locally numerous. Similar to the common and widespread Wilson’s Storm-Petrel (and may simply be a localized population of that species), but averages more white in plumage, especially on underwing and vent area. “Classic” Pincoya has big white panel on underside of wing, but other birds darker overall, and may not be distinguishable from Wilson’s Storm-Petrel."
0,Pine Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza leucocephalos,https://ebird.org/species/pinbun,"A large brown bunting often found in flocks in open forested areas. Breeding male is very handsome; warm brown overall with a bright white cheek patch and crown. Breeding female has largely white underparts and a dirtier white ear with a gray cast on her back. Wintering adults are darker and streakier, but retain the head patterning. Immature birds can be confusing, as they lack the large white cheek patch,and may be confused with Rustic Bunting; look out for a weaker crest, faint streaking on the belly, and a gray ear patch with a white dot near the end."
0,Pine Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Empidonax affinis,https://ebird.org/species/pinfly1,"Small flycatcher of pine-oak forest and edge in highlands; often in clearings and orchards with small deciduous trees (often not in pines). Other Empidonax flycatchers occur alongside Pine Flycatcher, especially very similar Dusky and Hammond’s Flycatchers, which are winter migrants. On Pine, note the bright pale teardrop-shaped eyering similar to Hammond’s and an entirely pale orangish underside to the bill (like Cordilleran Flycatcher, which is greener and has a broader bill ). Call is a rather quiet “pwip,” somewhat similar to Dusky but very distinct from Hammond’s."
0,Pine Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Pinicola enucleator,https://ebird.org/species/pingro,"Large, plump finch of the boreal forest. Adult males are pink overall with two white wingbars and pale gray highlights. Immature males and females are not so bright but still subtly pretty; gray body with olive, yellow, or burnt-orange head and rump. Stubby bill with rounded edges. Breeds in open coniferous forests. Winters in a variety of wooded habitats, especially around fruiting trees including crabapple and mountain ash. Often extremely tame, allowing close approach."
0,Pine Siskin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Spinus pinus,https://ebird.org/species/pinsis,"Small, brown, streaked finch. Some show yellow in the wing and tail. Sharply pointed bill. Short, notched tail and long wings. Often visits feeders in areas with conifers.

0,Pine Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga pinus,https://ebird.org/species/pinwar,"A medium-sized, rather robust and long-tailed warbler, with a noticeably stout bill. Variable plumage, from bright adult males with extensive yellow throat to extremely dull grayish-brown immature females. Always look for two white wingbars, diffuse streaking on the sides of the breast, large bill, and long narrow tail with a shallow notch. Well-named: almost always found in pine trees throughout the year. In spring and summer, listen for loud musical trill (compare with Chipping Sparrow and Dark-eyed Junco). Occasionally visits feeders, especially for suet. A short-distance migrant, wintering entirely in the United States."
0,Pink Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Nesoenas mayeri,https://ebird.org/species/pinpig2,"Very large pigeon with a pink head and underparts, brown wings, and a rufous tail. In flight, the pale head and rump patch are distinctive. Found locally on the island of Mauritius in humid forest, plantations, and secondary habitat.

0,Piping Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Bycanistes fistulator,https://ebird.org/species/piphor1,"A medium-sized forest hornbill frequently seen flying overhead or crossing road cuts. Distinctive in its stark pied appearance, with black head, back, forewings, and central tail feathers. In flight, has very distinctive bicolored wings. Similar to African Pied Hornbill, but Piping Hornbill has broad white flight feathers, and its smaller bill and neck give it a stouter appearance. Calls include a rapid series of cackling notes, “huhuhuhuhu,” and higher-pitched piping whistles."
0,Piping Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius melodus,https://ebird.org/species/pipplo,"Small, plump, pale plover; the color of dry sand. In breeding plumage look for thin broken black collar across chest, black stripe across forehead, orange legs, and orange bill with black tip. Nonbreeding and immature birds have black bills and sandy-colored breastbands. White wingstripe visible in flight. Notably paler than other small plovers, with the exception of Snowy, from which Piping is distinguished by thicker bill and orange legs. Sometimes seen near other shorebirds, but rarely ventures far from the high, dry side of the beach. Often quite vocal; gives a sad-sounding two-parted whistle that drops in pitch: ""pwee-doo."" A species of great conservation concern, due to coastal development and disturbance at nesting sites on beaches."
0,Pipipi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mohouidae,Mohoua novaeseelandiae,https://ebird.org/species/pipipi1,"A small, noisy songbird endemic to New Zealand, found on the South and Stewart Islands. Favors myriad forest types. Note brown upperparts with an ashy-gray face and neck, and pale creamy-brown underparts. Often located first by its harsh chattering contact calls and canary-like song. Forms fast-moving flocks in the canopy that will come down to investigate “squeaking.” Associates with other species such as Silvereye and Gray Gerygone in the non-breeding season, forming noisy, continuously chattering flocks. Pipipi is the main host of the parasitic Long-tailed Koel, and so adults can be encountered feeding a much larger Koel chick. Distinguished from Dunnock by lighter underparts; does not feed on the ground. Look for sharp contrast between gray face and lighter underparts and larger size to distinguish from Gray Gerygone."
0,Piratic Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Legatus leucophaius,https://ebird.org/species/pirfly1,"Found in tropical lowlands and foothills, migratory in northern part of its range. Favors forest edges, plantations, and clearings with tall trees. Named for its behavior of stealing already-built nests of oropendolas and becards.

The call is a high-pitched and quickly repeated “kek.” Separated from other pratincoles by its combination of small size, dark coloration, and stripes under the wings."
0,Rock Ptarmigan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lagopus muta,https://ebird.org/species/rocpta1,"Plump chickenlike bird found in rocky tundra and alpine summits. Plumage changes strikingly throughout the year. In winter, both sexes are pure white with black outer tail feathers. As summer progresses, male develops cold grayish-brown feathers on head, neck, and back; generally quite splotchy looking. Summer female is paler golden-brown with intricate black and white markings. Female nearly identical to Willow Ptarmigan; look for slightly smaller bill. Summer male Willow and Rock Ptarmigans can be separated by the colder grayish plumage on Rock Ptarmigan and in winter by the distinctive black eyeline on Rock Ptarmigan. Also note habitat differences. Best distinguished from White-tailed Ptarmigan by black outer tail feathers. Vocalizations include guttural groaning and clucking notes."
0,Rock Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris ptilocnemis,https://ebird.org/species/rocsan,"Plump, rock-loving shorebird with slightly droopy bill.

0,Rodrigues Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus rodericanus,https://ebird.org/species/rodbrw1,"A medium-sized yellowish-olive bird with a long tail that is often flipped up and down. Endemic to the remote island of Rodrigues. Found in secondary forest, scrub, and plantations. Feeds both in the undergrowth and up into the canopy. The cheerful song is a quick series of several musical warbling notes in an up-and-down pattern. The calls include “chek” notes and rattling scolds. There are no other warblers or otherwise similar species on Rodrigues, so identification is simple."
0,Roll's Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila rolli,https://ebird.org/species/gybpar5,"Restricted to montane and foothill broadleaf forests between 500 and 2000 meters in the Batak Highlands of northern Sumatra. Forages in dense vegetation on the forest floor, often pairs, but also singly and in small groups. More easily heard than seen; listen for its song, a rapid and seemingly endless series of steadily rising hooting whistles. Pairs often duet. If seen, note the bright white cheek patch, black head, and black-and-brown-striped body; also note the bright red patch of bare skin around the eye, and curved black-and-white streaks running down the sides. Vocalizations and appearance similar to Sumatran Partridge, but separated by range and present species’ warm brown breast and more extensive white on the face."
0,Rondonia Warbling-Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Hypocnemis ochrogyna,https://ebird.org/species/ronwaa1,"A relatively small antbird. Males are heavily streaked black and white on the head and back with a lightly streaked breast, and rusty flanks and lower back. Females have a browner tinge to the head and back. Inhabits the understory of humid primary forest and old second growth, favoring tree fall gaps. Sometimes accompanies mixed-species flocks and regularly attends army-ant swarms. The song begins with a clear series of 4-6 notes and finishes with harsh notes."
0,Rook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus frugilegus,https://ebird.org/species/rook1,"Fairly common in farmland and other semiopen areas with hedges and groups of tall trees, where nests in rookeries. Forages on ground, usually in flocks, and associates readily with crows and jackdaws. Easily passed off as a crow unless you see the diagnostic pale patch at base of bill. Rook calls are higher pitched and less rolling than crow calls. Juvenile lacks pale bill base and is very similar to Carrion Crow, but bill a little more tapered; pale bill base develops late in first winter."
0,Roraiman Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmelastes saturatus,https://ebird.org/species/rorant2,"Dark bird of highland forest understory. Male is entirely dark gray except for bold white wing spots; female is brown above and rufous below with a gray face. Inhabits tall premontane forest, generally between 500–1800 m on tepui slopes, and is especially likely to be found in steep terrain and in areas with many large, mossy boulders. Usually found in pairs that forage for insects on or near the ground, probing into crevices and tossing aside leaves, much like others of genus; does not typically join mixed-species flocks. Song is a long series of sharp notes, swelling in volume and dropping in pitch at end. Very similar to Spot-winged Antbird of lowlands, which it replaces at higher elevations (no known overlap); best distinguished by voice and habitat."
0,Roraiman Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Herpsilochmus roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/rorant1,"A common but inconspicuous bird of tepui forest canopy. Usually seen from below; note long shape accentuated by heavy bill and long tail. Male is gray above and white below, with a black crown, bold white eyebrow, wing spotting, and extensively white undertail. Females are similar to males but have more brown tones in plumage. Forages sluggishly in canopy of tepui foothill forest, searching for insects along branches and in leaf clusters. More common at lower elevations than many other tepui endemics (sometimes below 500 m). Usually in pairs and best detected by voice; often follows mixed-species flocks but also found away from them. Contact call is a rubbery smacking, often doubled and repeated in long series by members of a pair. Song is a hoarse, emphatic series of laughing notes, decelerating and dropping slightly in pitch. Similar to Spot-tailed and Todd’s antwrens (and may overlap with latter at lower elevations) but substantially larger, with bolder markings and more white in tail; song is similar to that of Todd’s but longer and hoarser."
0,Roraiman Barbtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Roraimia adusta,https://ebird.org/species/rorbar1,"Small, boldly patterned bird of mossy tepui forests. Mostly rufous-brown on back and tail, with dark ear patch, bright white throat, and dark underparts streaked white. Found only in humid, mossy forest on tepui slopes, where it is often one of the more common understory birds provided moss growth is sufficient. Clambers over branches and climbs small tree trunks, gleaning insects from bark and probing into moss, usually in the understory but up into middle levels as well. Often follows mixed-species flocks. Contact call between members of a pair is an sharp squeak. Song is a series of 6–9 high-pitched, forceful notes, the first somewhat lower pitched. Unlikely to be mistaken for other species given bold plumage pattern and restricted range."
0,Roraiman Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiophobus roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/rorfly1,"Rare flycatcher with a scattered distribution in outlying ridges of the eastern Andes, the tepui region of northern South America, and several other remote mountain ranges. Inhabits cloud forest, often in areas with sandy soil. Combination of brown upperparts, rusty wingbars, and faintly streaked yellowish underparts separate it from other small flycatchers in range. Male has a reddish-orange crown patch that is almost always concealed. Gives a variety of calls including squeaks and rapid trills."
0,Roraiman Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Setopagis whitelyi,https://ebird.org/species/rornig1,"A medium-sized, dark nightjar of tepui highlands, difficult to identify by plumage alone. Cryptically patterned with dark brown and gray accented with buffy and whitish bars and spots. Male has a white band in the wing, which the female lacks. Uncommon, found in humid forest and edges, as well as humid scrub close to forested areas. Distinctive voice is a hoarse whistle “whoEEuuu”, given repeatedly. Larger than the similar Band-winged Nightjar, and smaller than Blackish Nightjar, but best identified by voice and habitat."
0,Rose Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Petroica rosea,https://ebird.org/species/rosrob1,"Small arboreal Australian robin. Male slaty-gray above, with pink breast and white belly and undertail. White outer tail feathers noticeable when sallying for insects, recalling fantails. Female gray above, paler below, with pink tinges to the breast. Often droops wings while perched and shivers. Forages in the mid-story of rainforest of southeastern Australia. Song a long, distinctive phrase that is worth learning."
0,Roseate Spoonbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Platalea ajaja,https://ebird.org/species/rosspo1,"Unique pink wading bird with long, flat, spoon-shaped bill. Adults are mostly pink overall, with scarlet wing patches, orange tail, and bare pale-green head. Immatures are duller than adults but still washed with pale pink. Sometimes mistaken for a flamingo, but note spoonbill's distinctive bill, shorter legs, and shorter neck. Occurs in freshwater and saltwater wetlands from the Gulf Coast of the U.S. through much of South America. Feeds by sifting side-to-side through shallow water. Often in small loose groups, sometimes with other wading birds like storks and herons."
0,Roseate Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna dougallii,https://ebird.org/species/roster,"Graceful pale tern with extremely long forked tail. Named for faint rosy wash on belly. Bill color varies geographically; Old World birds arrive on breeding grounds with a black bill that turns to red, while New World birds arrive with a red bill that turns darker. Similar to Common Tern, but notably whiter wings. With practice, look for shallow, choppier wingbeats to distinguish from other tern species. Widespread across the globe but local, breeding in scattered colonies, often on offshore islands. Can be found mixed in flocks with other terns on beaches, mudflats, or estuaries. Listen for harsh two-parted call ""chivick."""
0,Ross's Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anser rossii,https://ebird.org/species/rosgoo,"Cute miniature version of Snow Goose with smaller body, shorter neck, and stubbier bill. Pay special attention to the bill: short, with a straighter border where it meets the face, a much less obvious dark “grin patch,” and often bluish-gray color at the base. Also note clean white head; Snow Goose typically has yellowish staining on face. Hybrids with Snow Goose are rare but regular; some intermediates might be best left unidentified. Dark morph Ross’s is extremely rare. Typically found in flocks, but individuals may be found with other geese species. Frequently in large mixed flocks with Snow Geese. Occurs in fields, marshes, and lakes during migration and winter; breeds on Arctic tundra."
0,Ross's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Rhodostethia rosea,https://ebird.org/species/rosgul,"Long-winged, wedge-tailed, delicate seabird of far northern climates, nesting in open wet tundra and wintering around sea ice, occasionally moving into coastal areas. Breeding adult astonishingly beautiful: pearly gray above, rose-pink below, with coral-red legs, thin black collar, and tiny black bill. Nonbreeding adult has a tiny black dot near the ear and loses the black collar and much or all of the pink coloration. First-winter birds have blackish “M” pattern in upperwing and black tip on wedge-shaped tail. Flight graceful and buoyant."
0,Ross's Turaco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Musophagiformes,Musophagidae,Musophaga rossae,https://ebird.org/species/rostur1,"Spectacular purple turaco with a yellow bill and face and a puffy red crest. Shows large crimson wing patches in flight. Found along forest edge, and in gallery forest and lush gardens. Acts like a typical turaco, bouncing through the trees, and flying occasionally with short bursts of wingbeats and long glides. Call is a low, up-and-down trill that is often given in raucous chorus by a group. Similar to Violet Turaco, but minimal overlap in range, and Ross’s is easily separated by its red crest and yellow bill."
0,Rosy Minivet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Pericrocotus roseus,https://ebird.org/species/rosmin1,"Pale, rather washed-out-looking minivet. Male has a white throat, pink breast, and bright red “apostrophe” on the wing. Female replaces male’s red and pink with yellow, but is otherwise similar. Both have prominent dark lores. Usually moves in pairs, but will form flocks outside of the breeding season. Breeds in a wide range of lowland and foothill forests; favors hill and valley forests in the winter. Gives twittering trill in flight."
0,Rosy Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus roseatus,https://ebird.org/species/rospip1,"An elegant, well-marked pipit that breeds in montane regions,but descends down into meadows and agricultural fields in the winter. Breeding adult is unmistakable with a soft pink throat and breast. Nonbreeding adults and immature birds lack the pink breast, but have a thick creamy white brow and mustache stripe, as well as thick blotchy streaking on the breast. Buff-bellied and Red-throated Pipits are also strongly marked on the breast, but both have much weaker brow patterns than Rosy Pipit. Gives a squeaky “tseep!”. Sings repetitive high-pitched song from the ground and while in the air."
0,Rosy Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Pastor roseus,https://ebird.org/species/rossta2,"Adult is unique, a vision in glossy black and pale pink. Juvenile is brown with an orange bill. Breeds in colonies on steppes and winters in open and wooded habitats. Gathers in huge numbers to roost, often mixing with other species at roost sites. Flocking birds keep up a constant cacophony of dry chattering calls."
0,Rote Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox rotiensis,https://ebird.org/species/souboo4,"Found only in forested areas on Rote Island, this medium-sized brown owl is physically all but identical to several closely-related species spread out across Indonesia and Australasia; fortunately, no others are present on Rote. Note the bright yellow eyes, speckled underparts, and large round head characteristic of the Boobooks. Gives a very dry, grating “grukgruk”, often in extended series and in duets. Formerly regarded as a subspecies of Southern Boobook."
0,Rote Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus rotiensis,https://ebird.org/species/rolwar1,"A small, very long-billed warbler with a conspicuous yellow-orange underside to bill. Note broad yellow eyebrow, dark crown with pale central stripe, olive upperparts, single faint wingbar, and extensive yellow underparts. Singles and pairs inhabit canopy in forest patches and woodlands at all altitudes. Unusually for leaf warblers, regularly probes bark for insects. Restricted to Rote, where it is the only regular leaf warbler. Exceptionally long bill, central crown stripe, weak single wingbar, and yellow-flushed underside separate it from Arctic and Kamchatka Leaf Warblers. Calls similar to those of other regional leaf warblers. Song is a high-pitched, rising and falling warble, “chit-swee-swer-swoo.” Also gives a disyllabic “tchewit” call."

Males blackish with a vivid red hood and rump and a paler belly. Females are brown with a paler belly and a noticeable red wash to the throat, forehead, and cheeks. Found singly or in pairs in lowland woodland, forest edge, and gardens, favoring the upper parts of trees. Unmistakable, as there are no other myzomelas in its limited range on Rote island. Vocalizations include a fast-paced sequence of staccato, metallic notes: “zip-zip-zip-zip-zip-zip…”."
0,Rothschild's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Cypseloides rothschildi,https://ebird.org/species/rotswi1,"Uncommon swift found along the east slope of the Andes from central Bolivia to northwestern Argentina. Uniform sooty brown, lacking any strong plumage characteristics. Easily confused with Sick’s Swift, but is larger with longer wings, giving it a sleeker and more aerodynamic appearance; also lacks a pale throat, though this is often hard to see clearly. In central Bolivia it could be mistaken for Chestnut-collared Swift (some of which lack a chestnut collar), but wings are slightly narrower at the base. Usually seen in flocks of a few birds up to 20 or more that circle over humid forest."
0,Rotuma Myzomela,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Myzomela chermesina,https://ebird.org/species/rotmyz1,"A striking myzomela with beautifully contrasting plumage.

Female is mostly green with a buffy or whitish collar, belly, and throat. Her tail is blue and shorter than male’s. This species is very localized, and prefers shorter forest and scrub near ridgelines."
0,Royal Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Thalasseus maximus,https://ebird.org/species/royter1,"Large tern, found strictly in coastal areas. Feeds in open ocean and saltwater bays, where it flies high above the water looking for small fish. Rests on beaches, often in groups with other species. Separated from many terns by large size; only slightly smaller than Caspian. Look for the thinner orange bill (usually not deep red) and shaggier crest compared with Caspian. Also, forehead whiter than Caspian Tern in the nonbreeding season; this can show as early as midsummer."
0,Ruaha Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myrmecocichla collaris,https://ebird.org/species/ruacha1,"Chunky, mostly black robin-like bird. The male has a white crown, while the female shows a white throat with some scaly dark markings. Both sexes have a large white panel in the wing. Found in woodland and scrub, often in rocky areas and near human habitation. The song is a variable, exuberant mix of whistling and rattling calls. Very similar to Arnot’s Chat, but usually separated by range, and also identified by the single large white patch on the wing, as opposed to one large patch and a smaller disconnected one."
0,Rubeho Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia aurantiithorax,https://ebird.org/species/rubaka1,"A rather small, demure understory denizen resembling a cross between a robin and a flycatcher. Mostly dull brown above, with an olive-brown crown and richer orange-brown underparts. Juvenile is more mottled. A highly local bird, found singly and in pairs in the understory of primary and secondary montane forest in a narrow range along the Rubeho and Ukaguru (and possibly Uluguru) mountains escarpment between 1800 and 2200 meters. Sits for long periods, sallying to catch insect prey, or forages on the ground, often in the company of ants and other ant-following birds. Sings a simple high-pitched “tsoot-tseeet-soo-seeet” and other similar songs. Calls include an invariable piping “wheet” uttered once a second. Alarm call is a grating, ticking “drrrzzt, drrrt, drrrt.” May be mistaken for a flycatcher, but its furtive nature and preference for thick understory are unique within its range."
0,Rudd's Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis ruddi,https://ebird.org/species/rudapa1,"A slender warbler that is gray and green above and pale below with a distinctive black throat band (narrower in the female), a short eyebrow, and a dark eye. Pairs are resident, occasionally joining flocks, in sand dune and riverine forest, thickets, and dense thorn scrub. The species is inconspicuous unless vocalizing: the male sings 5-15 rapid, repeated clucking “truk” notes that run together, and the female often joins in a duet with a more melodious trill. The similar Bar-throated Apalis differs from Rudd’s Apalis by having a pale eye and lacking an eyebrow."
0,Rudd's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Heteromirafra ruddi,https://ebird.org/species/rudlar1,"A small, stocky lark with an upright posture, a large head, and a short narrow tail. The back is spangled with tawny, black, and, white, and the head is boldly marked with a conspicuous eyebrow, an eye-ring, and a diagnostic pale central crown stripe. The throat and belly are plain, with the buff-washed breast diffusely streaked. Pairs are very local in heavily grazed short grassland between 1600-2000 meters of elevation. Males have a protracted aerial display, fluttering into the wind and dangling in the sky, in limbo, for up to 40 minutes. The easiest way to find Rudd’s Lark is when it is singing its distinctive song on the ground or in display, generally a short buzzy phrase of 3-5 (up to 8) notes, repeated several times a few seconds apart before the bird changes to a new variation, such as “Bee-dzip-pliieeep-DZREEE”, “Dr-rik-plip-SEEE” or “Krieek-kreee-OEEE.”"
0,Ruddy Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Laterallus ruber,https://ebird.org/species/rudcra1,"A small, elusive bird of freshwater marshes, damp fields, and roadside ditches; heard much more often than seen.

Sandy-brown overall with gray head and whitish breast with dark central spotting. Very similar to Bell’s Sparrow and once considered the same species. Sagebrush Sparrow is usually paler and less contrasty overall. Also look for Sagebrush's relatively indistinct and narrow dark mustache stripe and distinct dark streaks on pale brown back. Found in shrubby expanses of sagebrush in western North America (more extensive range than Bell’s, essentially only overlapping in winter). Perches up conspicuously when singing; otherwise stays low and hidden. Frequently runs on the ground, often with tail cocked up. Song is a jumble of mechanical, musical notes, slower than Bell's Sparrow."

Breeds on Hokkaido, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands. Very similar to Gray’s Grasshopper-Warbler, which breeds on mainland of far northeastern Asia and has a different song. Migrants very difficult to distinguish from Gray’s, but Sakhalin averages warmer-toned and browner, with perhaps a slightly paler throat. Sings from deep cover, day and night, a hurried, loud, choppy song."
0,Sakhalin Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus borealoides,https://ebird.org/species/salwar1,"Small songbird, virtually identical in plumage to Pale-legged Leaf Warbler, of which it was formerly considered a subspecies. Vertical tail pumping distinguishes this species from most others in its range except Pale-legged. Forages through the different layers of forest and like Pale-legged (and unlike most other leaf warblers) sometimes forages on the ground. Call note is a hard metallic “pit,” similar to Pale-legged, but marginally higher in frequency (visible on spectrogram); song a series of rhythmic whistles with clear distinctions between each note, very unlike the high, rapid trill of Pale-legged. Breeds in forest edges and clearings; can be found in a range of wooded habitats in migration and on wintering grounds."
0,Salim Ali's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Apus salimalii,https://ebird.org/species/saaswi1,"A large scimitar-winged swift of valleys, cliffs, and gorges. Nests in buildings and rock crevices; often gives a chattering scream when entering and leaving the nest. Dusky brown with a pale grayish belly, bright white rump, and forked tail. Essentially indistinguishable from the closely related Pacific Swift, but ranges do not overlap; Salim Ali’s Swift is restricted to the highlands of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and adjoining foothill regions."
0,Salinas Monjita,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Neoxolmis salinarum,https://ebird.org/species/salmon1,"Striking flycatcher restricted to the salt flats of the central Argentine lowlands.

The similar Painted Parakeet has a larger blue patch on the forehead and red shoulder patch. The calls of Painted and Santarem parakeets are apparently indistinguishable."
0,Sapayoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sapayoidae,Sapayoa aenigma,https://ebird.org/species/sapayo1,"A strange greenish bird with a limited distribution from Panama to northwest Ecuador. Dull olive overall, slightly brighter yellow on the throat and upper breast. It also has a concealed yellow crown patch, but it is difficult to see. The bill is notably broad and subtly hooked at the tip. Somewhat large-headed and front-heavy. Despite its dull plumage, this species is relatively distinctive within its range. Compare with Green Manakin, which is more compact and slightly shorter-tailed than Sapayoa. Voice is also helpful: listen for Sapayoa’s “teew, teew” calls and its soft trilled chatter. Found in the understory of mature lowland forest, singly, in pairs, or in small groups, often following mixed-species flocks. Interestingly, this species has no close relatives in the Americas; it is most closely related to Asian broadbills."
0,Sapphire Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula sapphira,https://ebird.org/species/sapfly1,"Breeding adult male is royal blue with a white belly and orange throat and chest.

Uniform olive green with a white ear spot and indistinct streak in the base of the bill. Some geographical overlap with the similar Forest Honeyeater, the only other similar species with a white ear spot, but Scrub Honeyeater has more green in the wing and is usually in scrub rather than forest interior. Call, a “chup!” similar to other similar species or a rapid series of whistles."
0,Scrub Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Stilpnia vitriolina,https://ebird.org/species/scrtan1,"This Andean species is fairly common in dry open habitats in Colombia and Ecuador.

Brighter cinnamon wash on flanks. Compared to similar Marsh Wren, note head pattern: Sedge has streaky crown and much less obvious pale eyebrow. Sedge also has barred wings and lacks plain dark brown shoulder patch. Also note habitat differences: prefers damp weedy fields and meadows, not cattail marshes. Generally secretive, but perches up when singing. Like most wrens, small size contrasts with large voice: one or two introductory notes followed by a loud, sharp, metallic trill of varying speed. Breeds mainly in the central U.S. and Canada; winters to northeast Mexico."
0,Selva Cacique,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Cacicus koepckeae,https://ebird.org/species/selcac1,"Rare cacique found very locally in lowland forest in southeastern Peru and extreme SW Brazil, especially near forest-fringed lakes and rivers. Note yellow rump and pale blue eye, which separate it from Solitary Black Cacique. Told from Yellow-rumped Cacique by the yellow being limited to the rump in Selva. No overlap with the closely related Ecuadorian Cacique. It has a varied vocal repertoire, with whistles, metallic squeaks, and various buzzing notes, among other calls."
0,Semicollared Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula semitorquata,https://ebird.org/species/semfly1,"Very similar to other black-and-white small flycatchers. Male differs from Collared and Pied Flycatchers in thinly connected black crown and mantle, and white median coverts.

It may now be extinct. While there have been a few reports in recent decades, the last substantiated sighting was in 1961. It is a dull, mostly gray bird with slightly paler underparts, brownish wings, yellow legs, and a hint of a pale eyebrow. Inhabits rainforest understory, and historical accounts suggest that it is quite shy and largely terrestrial. Its decline has been mainly attributed to introduced predators, though other factors may have been involved as well."
0,Senegal Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/senbat1,"Typical black, white, and dark-gray batis. Note the chest band, which is black in males and rufous in females. The cap is dark gray, and there is a long eyebrow that is white in males and buff in females. Found in all types of savanna, ranging from moist Guinea savanna to dry thorn savanna. Often in pairs. Male very similar to male Gray-headed and Western Black-headed Batises, but has a broader eyebrow stripe, and is usually associated with the distinctive female. The song is more variable, quieter, and less distinctive than that of most batises; usually includes a combination of buzzing notes and higher whistled “kreit” notes, and sometimes also wing and bill snaps."
0,Senegal Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/sencou1,"Small coucal with a black cap and buffy underparts.

In flight it has a distinctive white wedge on the back of the inner wing. Small groups scurry over open dry savanna and short-grass plains below 1600 m, looking for insects. It moves to areas experiencing bush fires as it prefers breeding in recently burned grasslands. It can be surprisingly unobtrusive, but the loud two-note “chi-whoo” call often gives it away. The similar Black-winged Lapwing differs by preferring high-altitude grassland and cultivation above 1300 m and in being larger, having reddish (not dark) legs, a larger, diffuse forehead patch, and a dark edge to the back of the inner wing."
0,Senegal Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Poicephalus senegalus,https://ebird.org/species/senpar,"Chunky mid-sized parrot with a green back and breast, a gray head, and a colorful belly that shows some geographical variation from yellow to reddish-orange.

0,Sharpe's Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia sharpei,https://ebird.org/species/shaaka1,"Small, fairly plain, brown-and-orange robin-like bird. The tail is uniformly rufous-brown and the face shows a pale-gray eyebrow. Found locally in the understory of montane forest. Very shy and inconspicuous. The song is a quick, tripping series of high whistles. Also gives an alternating series of high-pitched piping notes and low-pitched scolding trills. Similar in size, shape, and behavior to Iringa and Usambara Akalats, but distinguished by orange underparts."
0,Sharpe's Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis sharpii,https://ebird.org/species/shaapa2,"A slender, plain sooty-gray apalis with red eyes and a white-tipped tail; female has a buff-chestnut throat. Juvenile has yellowish underparts. Restricted to Upper Guinea, where it is resident; pairs inhabit the canopy of tall primary and secondary lowland, gallery, and dry forest, where no similar apalises occur. Most often detected by its characteristic song, a sweet rollicking “chi-reet, chi-reet, chi-reet,” sometimes given in duet."
0,Sharpe's Drongo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicruridae,Dicrurus sharpei,https://ebird.org/species/shadro1,"A small, square-tailed drongo primarily found perched high above the ground near open areas in the forest or forest edge. Look for this species’ relatively short, mostly square tail and note its upright posture as it perches in the canopy and subcanopy. Listen for its harsh, wheezy “rahr!” and whistled “wu-it wu-it!” calls, as well as other varied harsh and bubbly calls, many of which are delivered in pairs. Formerly lumped with multiple other square-tailed drongo species in other parts of Africa."
0,Sharpe's Longclaw,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Hemimacronyx sharpei,https://ebird.org/species/shalon1,"A small, pretty member of the pipit family. Note the yellow underparts, the breast band of black streaks, and the scaly brown upperparts. Males and females are similar, but females are duller. The white edges of the tail are conspicuous in weak, fluttering flight. Found on the ground in montane grassland, often in wet areas. Similar to Yellow-throated Longclaw, but there is little overlap in range, and Sharpe’s is separated by being much smaller and having a streaky rather than solid black breast band. Brownish immatures can be confused with pipits, but show some pale yellow below. The song is a series of musical whistles in an up-and-down pattern, given from a perch or in flight. The calls include a sharp “siit” and a longer, metallic “chweee.”"
0,Sharpe's Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus verreauxii,https://ebird.org/species/spwros3,"Uncommon medium-sized rosefinch. Male is dark wine pink above and frosty bubblegum pink below, with strikingly pale white eyebrows. Female is gray-brown with streaked underparts and long pale eyebrows; similar to female Chinese White-browed Rosefinch, but note overall buffier coloration, paler streaking, less prominent stripes on the cheeks, and lack of tan-yellow in the eyebrow and near the vent. Sharpe’s breeds in open alpine areas with scrubby cover such as forest edge; moves downslope in the winter. Call is a sharp inflected “pink.”"
0,Sharpe's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Pholia sharpii,https://ebird.org/species/shasta2,"Small, distinctive starling with a blue-black back, a white throat, and a buff belly. Except in good light, the upperparts usually look black. The pale eye is always distinctive. Uncommon and local in montane forest. Found in the canopy, in pairs or small flocks; often perches up conspicuously on dead snags and other open perches. The call is a sharp “sveet” and the song is a high-pitched tinkling that is distinctive, but quiet and easily ignored. Separated from similar starlings by its pale throat."
0,Shelley's Crimsonwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Cryptospiza shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/shcwin1,"A spectacular, distinctive, enigmatic waxbill with a red bill and upperparts, an olive throat, orange flanks, and black wings. Sexes differ: male is red from forehead to nape and female is olive. Juvenile is like the female, but lacks orange flanks. Very poorly known; endemic to the Albertine Rift where it is very rare, preferring the understory of moist closed forest, forest edges near streams, and bamboo, between 1600 and 3000 meters of elevation. Call is described as a series of twittering “tu-tu-tu-ti-ti-ti” notes rising and then falling."
0,Shelley's Francolin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Scleroptila shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/shefra2,"Medium-sized, beautifully-patterned francolin. Shows rufous patches in the wings in flight. Found on the ground in areas with thick grass, ranging from pure grassland to lush woodland. Call is a rhythmic up-and-down repeated “chil-it, chil-chow”.

0,Shelley's Rufous Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/shrspa1,"A typical sparrow with a striped back, a gray crown and nape, and a black bib. The rufous rump is conspicuous in flight. The sexes are similar, though males are brighter overall and have more rufous on the face. Found locally in dry thorn savanna and cultivated areas, sometimes around human habitation. Similar to Somali Sparrow, but the male is separated by his gray crown and the female by her much more colorful overall plumage. Very similar to Kenya Rufous Sparrow, but not known to overlap in range, and Shelley’s is separated by its dark eye. The call is a cheerful “chirp” like that of other sparrows."
0,Shelley's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/shesta1,"A small dark starling of dry country. The upperparts are iridescent, with a blue sheen on the head and green on most of the wing. Also note the chestnut underparts and the yellow-orange eye. Found in dry thorn savanna and thorn scrub, usually in small wandering flocks, often with other species of starlings. Similar to Hildebrandt’s Starling, but slightly smaller and darker overall, with a deeper rufous belly and a less contrasting green wing. Also reminiscent of Superb Starling, but doesn’t have a white chest band. Gives mewing calls, often in a long, continuous series."
0,Shelley's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/shesun2,"The breeding male has an iridescent green hood and rump, a red breast band, and black underparts. The underparts are grayish in non-breeding plumage. The female has streaking on the underparts. Found in miombo and other types of lush woodland, thick scrub, and gardens. The song is a typical sunbird fast jumble, and the most common call is a repeated “tyimp.” Breeding male similar to Marico and Purple-banded Sunbirds, but has a pure red rather than maroon breast band. Non-breeding male resembles Miombo Double-collared Sunbird, but has a green rather than blue rump."
0,Shikra,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter badius,https://ebird.org/species/shikra1,"A common, widespread resident across Asia and Africa. Adult males have a reddish iris, blue gray upperparts and fine brownish-orange barring on underparts. Females have a yellowish iris and brownish gray upperparts. Both have narrow dark barring on the tail. Juveniles are browner with a prominent moustachial stripe and streaked underparts. It hunts for a wide variety of prey in woodland, savannah, and even suburban gardens, dashing out from perches within vegetation to grab its prey."
0,Shining Bronze-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Chrysococcyx lucidus,https://ebird.org/species/shbcuc1,"A small glossy-greenish bird with a heavily barred throat, chest and tail. Parasitises gerygone species across its range. Distinguished from Horsfield’s Bronze-Cuckoo in Australia by lacking the dark stripe through the eye, and typically occurs in wetter and denser forest than Horsfield’s. Listen for territorial calls with a fast repeated rising “coo-ee” whistle (2 whistles per second), which can have phrases with a rougher and slower falling “tsee-ew” whistle (1 whistle per second) mixed in."
0,Shining Drongo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Dicruridae,Dicrurus atripennis,https://ebird.org/species/shidro1,"A large, extremely glossy square-tailed drongo of forest understory, often found with mixed-species flocks. Habitat is this species’ most reliable field mark, as no other drongos are regularly found in forest understory. Overall very glossy black, with red eyes and a fairly long square-tipped tail. Calls are a mix of sharp “chk!” calls and whistles that can be fairly variable."
0,Shining Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Myiagra alecto,https://ebird.org/species/shifly1,"A long-tailed, slender songbird with fine bill. Male entirely glossy blue-black. Female a rich chestnut above, white below, with black crown and face (in poor light, may appear dark above; compare Restless and Paperbark flycatchers).

0,Shining Sunbeam,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Aglaeactis cupripennis,https://ebird.org/species/shisun1,"Large, dark-brown hummingbird with lilac-gold iridescent lower back and rump. Like other sunbeams, it has a proportionally short bill for a hummingbird. Inhabits high elevation, semi-arid montane ridges and cloud forests.
You are my sunbeam, my Shining Sunbeam / You make me happy when you display / Aglaeactis cupripennis / Please don’t take my sunbeam away."
0,Shining Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris habessinicus,https://ebird.org/species/shisun3,"A medium-sized, long-billed sunbird in which males and females are very different. Males have a green head, a purple forehead, a red-and-yellow band across the chest, and a black belly. Females are plain, with olive-gray on the back and pale gray below. Found in dry thorn savanna, woodland, and gardens. Range does not overlap with any other species in which the males have a red belly band. Females can be identified with caution by their combination of plain, unstreaked underparts, long bill, and conspicuous pale eyebrow. Common vocalizations include a “vit” call and a dry trill."
0,Shiny Cowbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Molothrus bonariensis,https://ebird.org/species/shicow,"Common in Caribbean and South America. Found in semiopen and open grassy areas, often associated with livestock. Feeds mainly on the ground, but perches readily in bushes and trees. Male is glossy blue-black overall (often looks simply black). Female is plain grayish-brown overall. Bill shape is the key feature: blackish bill is more slender and pointed than bills of Brown-headed and Bronzed cowbirds. Also note similar but larger Melodious Blackbird, which has longer bill and often flicks its tail."
0,Shiny Whistling-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myophonus melanurus,https://ebird.org/species/shwthr1,"Chunky dark blue bird with a small bill and a short tail. Note iridescent spangling on the neck and brow of the male; female is plainer, with less iridescence. Endemic to Sumatra, where it can be found along streams in damp and mossy mountain and foothill forests. Forages actively on the ground and up in streamside trees. Calls include a piercing descending whistle and strange grating notes."
0,Shoebill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Balaenicipitidae,Balaeniceps rex,https://ebird.org/species/shoebi1,"Utterly unique bird that makes up its own family. The plumage is uniformly gray in adults and brownish in immatures. Structure is stork-like overall, but with a thick neck and massive hooked bill.

Shows an orange bill with black tip, orange eye-ring and legs, and distinctive white “halo” around head, below crown. Males have black mask on face, neck, and throat; mask is dark brown in females. Note broad white wingbar in flight. Juveniles lack face mask. Gives a soft “kleet” call, but territorial song is loud and ringing, similar to oystercatcher piping. Only found on a few predator-free islands around the New Zealand mainland and the Chatham Islands. Some birds have wandered to nearby mainland areas. Juveniles could be confused with juvenile Double-banded Plover (Banded Dotterel) but have much longer bills."
0,Shy Heathwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Hylacola cauta,https://ebird.org/species/shyhea1,"Small bird of open mallee and heathland in southwestern Australia and southern South Australia. Medium gray-brown above, whitish below, with distinct pale supercilium, red-brown rump, large white spot in the primaries (surrounded by black), dark chest streaking, and long, cocked tail. Forages quietly on the ground. Compare Chestnut-rumped Heathwren, which has a smaller pale wing spot, no black in wing, and paler legs. Despite the name, this species is not particularly shy."
0,Siamese Fireback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophura diardi,https://ebird.org/species/siafir1,"Remarkably plumaged terrestrial bird of lowland and foothill broadleaf forests, most often encountered on trails and roadsides in the early morning. Male blue-gray with a bright red face and long, glossy black tail. Namesake “fire back”, a splotch of bright iridescent coloration on the rump, is difficult to see. Female brown with black-and-white banded wings and smaller red facial skin patch. Similar female Silver Pheasant lacks prominent wing barring. Male whistles loudly to attract females."
0,Siau Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Erythropitta palliceps,https://ebird.org/species/siapit1,"An unmistakable round-bodied, short-tailed, long-legged forest bird with a striking red belly. Displays a thick blue chest band bordered above and below with black, a ruddy-brown head, and a forest-green back and wings. Confined to two islands in eastern Indonesia, where it inhabits forest. Terrestrial, foraging on the ground, but also calls from low branches in the understory. Unique in its range. Call is characteristic of this genus, a two-part quivering whistle, ascending on the first section, falling on the last: “waaaaaaop-aaaawowww.”"
0,Siau Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus siaoensis,https://ebird.org/species/sulsco2,"An extremely rare, little-known small brown owl confined to the tiny island of Siau. Cryptically patterned with ear tufts and yellow eyes. Currently only known from a 19th-century specimen, it has not been seen in the wild in modern times, and there are no confirmed field photographs or sound recordings. Presumably a very low-density forest owl, as very little habitat remains on Siau. Should be unmistakable, as it is the only owl on the island. Call currently unconfirmed, although recently a rolling ""ook-grrrrah” has been reported."
0,Siberian Accentor,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Prunellidae,Prunella montanella,https://ebird.org/species/sibacc,"The most migratory of the accentors, moving from its breeding territories in Russia to its wintering grounds in northern China and the upper Korean peninsula. Face is brightly marked: black with a yellow brow and throat. The more faded-looking juvenile can resemble Brown Accentor, but juvenile Siberian has a buffy brow, a gray nape, and buffy underparts. Forages in shrubby areas and thickets, usually in open forests and forest edges. Often seen in dense foliage overhanging or bordering narrow waterways."
0,Siberian Blue Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Larvivora cyane,https://ebird.org/species/sibrob,"A slender, long-legged songbird with a “crouched” profile. Adult male is unmistakable, with blue upperparts and snow-white belly separated by black running from the eye to the bend of the wing. Female warm brown with blue-tinted rump and whitish underparts.

Shy, tends to stay hidden. Pale brown above, whitish below, with olive-brown flanks and pale supercilium. Adult male has the namesake jewel-like red throat, bordered in black and white; younger male may have a hint of red, while female lacks red. Often droops wings and cocks tail upright. Variable melodic song consists of beautiful warbling and occasional mimicry; calls include low, hoarse “chuk” and high “chelee.”"
0,Siberian Stonechat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Saxicola maurus,https://ebird.org/species/sibsto1,"Chunky little bird of open landscapes; often sits on exposed perches. Breeding male has a black head, broad white half-collar, and rusty-red chest. Non-breeding male is patchier, with a paler head and chest. Female is predominantly streaky brown above, with a weaker, less contrasting face and chest pattern. European Stonechat is very similar, and can pose identification problems where the species overlap; look for Siberian’s larger white wing patch, duller orange on the chest, and whiter rump. Amur Stonechat is extremely similar, and in areas of overlap, or in cases of vagrancy, most individuals are inseparable based on current knowledge."
0,Siberian Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Geokichla sibirica,https://ebird.org/species/sibthr1,"Robust thrush, adult male unmistakable: dark slate-gray (black from a distance) overall, with an elegant, curving white eyebrow. Female is dark brown with a scaly pattern on the face and underparts; immature male is similar but replaces the female's brown with dark gray and has a grizzled whitish face. A shy and retiring bird, seldom leaving dense cover. Prefers well-shaded, damp areas of mid-elevation forests for breeding; winters in hill and montane forests. Forages mostly on the ground.

The song is a loud and descending “pepepew-pepepew.”"
0,Sichuan Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella chengi,https://ebird.org/species/sicbuw1,"Drab brown warbler of hilly central China; russet-brown above and cold gray-brown below, with dark stripes on the vent. Like many other bush warblers, very difficult to see as it skulks deep in dense vegetation; typically prefers to scurry or run instead of fly to reach cover. Note song: a plain, amphibian- or insect-like rasping, lower than that of Russet Bush Warbler."
0,Sichuan Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Perisoreus internigrans,https://ebird.org/species/sicjay1,"Sooty jay with a dark head and a bright yellow bill. Unlike many other jays, tends to be quiet and unobtrusive. Usually seen foraging in pairs or small family units. Glides across openings in the forest. Generally uncommon and local; frequently difficult to locate. No other corvid in the region combines a long tail, dark gray body, and yellow bill.

0,Sichuan Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus forresti,https://ebird.org/species/siclew1,"Like most leaf warblers, it is a small, active bird and excruciatingly difficult to identify; likely to be seen fleetingly in the upper layers of the forest. Very similar in appearance to other “Pallas’s-type” leaf warblers in its range. Bleached-white crown stripe and predominantly white brow stripes distinguish this species from the much yellower Pallas’s Leaf Warbler. Sichuan lacks the white tail edges (visible in flight) of Buff-barred and Ashy-throated warblers. Appears nearly identical to Lemon-rumped Warbler but has a brighter yellow rump and averages darker olive-green above. Breeds in mid- to high-elevation coniferous and mixed forests, but descends into foothills in the winter. Song has two types, both of which are difficult to distinguish from those of Lemon-rumped Warbler, but they tend to be slower in their delivery. Calls are crisp notes, slower-sounding and longer than those of Lemon-rumped Warbler."
0,Sichuan Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila rufipectus,https://ebird.org/species/sicpar1,"A rare and retiring partridge of mixed forest, found only in the south-central portion of China’s Sichuan province.

Duets loudly at dawn and dusk."
0,Sichuan Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Zoothera griseiceps,https://ebird.org/species/sicthr1,"Little-known thrush which breeds in the dense hilly and montane forests of China’s northern and central Sichuan province; favors dense understory and coniferous stands. Brown above with scaled white underparts. Grayish crown and heavier bill distinguish this species from similar Alpine Thrush, while short tail and lack of prominent “earmuffs” separate it from Long-tailed Thrush. Beautiful melodic song is rich and smooth, without many harsh notes."
0,Sichuan Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Poecile weigoldicus,https://ebird.org/species/sictit1,"Small drab tit with the typical black-head-white-cheek pattern of most tits. Darker-flanked and with a patchier ""bib"" than similar Black-bibbed Tit. Found in mid- to high-elevational hill and montane forests, often in areas with pines. Like many other small tits, an active forager, hovering and clambering about on thin branches, sometimes in mixed flocks. Gives a wide range of different vocalizations, including nasal and chipping call notes. Song includes nasal notes and a repeated high “tseep”."
0,Sichuan Treecreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Certhiidae,Certhia tianquanensis,https://ebird.org/species/sictre1,"Dull, short-billed treecreeper with a white throat, brown upperparts, and brown-suffused pale underparts. Restricted to mature montane coniferous stands, especially fir. Like other treecreepers, scrambles quickly up trunks and along branches with its tail held flat against the bark. Very similar to Hodgson’s Treecreeper, but Sichuan averages darker on the face and belly, with a different song: a long tinkling series of descending high notes. Call is high-pitched and sputtery, like a sped-up version of the song."
0,Sick's Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Chaetura meridionalis,https://ebird.org/species/sicswi1,Small swift with a uniform brown body contrasting with a pale-ochre rump and slightly paler throat.

0,Sierra Madre Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Xenospiza baileyi,https://ebird.org/species/simspa1,"Very local and endangered small sparrow of highlands in central Mexico; endemic. Occurs in bunchgrass within areas of open pine woods; often rather elusive. Feeds on the ground in grassy areas and adjacent plowed fields, but sings from prominent grass stalks. Plumage looks much like Song Sparrow, with gray face, black-streaked breast and flanks, and rusty wings. Song Sparrow is larger and bulkier, with less extensive rusty in wings, and almost always lives in wetter habitats."
0,Sierra Nevada Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Arremon basilicus,https://ebird.org/species/sthbrf4,"Shy and skulking brushfinch restricted to cloud forest in Colombia’s Santa Marta Mountains. Quite distinctive in its limited range, with a black face and breast spot, white throat, and striped head. It stays low in the understory and is often hard to see, but sometimes visits feeders within El Dorado Nature Reserve, where it can be easier to find. Song is a long series of high-pitched squeaks and trills."
0,Sierra de Lema Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Mionectes roraimae,https://ebird.org/species/mccfly3,"Small flycatcher restricted to mountains in southeastern Venezuela and adjacent parts of Brazil and Guyana. Plumage is olive with tawny on the breast and lower underparts. Formerly considered a subspecies of the very similar McConnell's Flycatcher, but it sounds different and is found at higher elevations. Separated from Ochre-bellied Flycatcher by lack of wingbars and different voice. Stays fairly low in humid forest, and sometimes joins mixed species flocks. Males loosely congregate in display areas where they sing a short, falling then rising metallic trill. Also gives chaotic bursts of modulated notes as well as sharp chips."
0,Sierran Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia pallatangae,https://ebird.org/species/sieela3,"Confusing flycatcher of montane forest. It has olive-gray upperparts, pale yellow underparts, white wingbars, and a small crest that is usually held flat. When crest is raised, it may show some white. Very similar to White-crested Elaenia, but usually brighter yellow on the belly and may show a more conspicuous eyering. Birds in worn plumage may not be identifiable with certainty. Its most common vocalizations, which include clear whistles and burry calls, are similar to those of other elaenias."

Warm tones on the tail contrast sharply with the cooler brown on the back and wings. Inhabits broadleaf and mixed forests, where it usually forages at the middle and upper levels. Unlike other treecreepers in the region, gives a long rapid-fire rattling trill instead of a series of high whistles and twitters."
0,Silver Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae,https://ebird.org/species/silgul2,"Small gray gull with red legs. Adult has red bill (younger birds have a darker bill), white head and body, pale gray ""silver"" wings, which have prominent black and white tips. Abundant across much of New Zealand and coastal Australia, including inland areas around waterways and rivers."
0,Silver Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus mellianus,https://ebird.org/species/silori1,"Male’s bone-white back and belly are unlike that of any other oriole. Female has the same black head and wings but has a gray-brown back and a densely streaked belly. Both sexes have reddish tails. Shape and color scheme are similar to Maroon Oriole (minimal range overlap), which is much darker and browner overall. Forages in the canopy and sometimes perches out on exposed snags and treetops. Uncommon and localized in lowland and foothill moist forests. Song is a musical, flute-like series of whistles. Gives cat-like mewing calls."

Variable across its large range, but the long-tailed male has either white or silvery-gray upperparts with a black crest, breast, and belly. Northern males are whiter above than their southern counterparts, though they still have some light black markings on the wings and back. Females are brownish overall with a much shorter tail. Both sexes have bright red face and legs. Hybridizes extensively with Kalij Pheasant where ranges overlap, producing variable intermediate hybrids."
0,Silver Teal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Spatula versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/siltea1,"Distinctive, but rather local and uncommon in Chile (more common in Argentina and elsewhere) in grassy wetlands, reedy marshes, and on lakes. Associates with other waterfowl, but usually is not out on open water and is easily overlooked. Readily identified by small size, dark cap, pale cheeks, and blue bill with yellow patch at base. Range does not overlap with the larger and more boldly patterned Puna Teal."
0,Silverbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis semipartitus,https://ebird.org/species/silver1,"A beautiful, distinctive, and simply marked flycatcher with silvery gray upperparts and orange underparts. Juveniles are buff-and-gray, lacking orange, and are covered in complex scalloped markings. Found in fairly moist thorn savanna, woodland, and cultivated areas. Perches conspicuously on open branches and other exposed perches. The song is a chatty mix of high-pitched squeaks and whistles, reminiscent of the song of a magpie-robin."
0,Silvered Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Sclateria naevia,https://ebird.org/species/silant1,"Unique-looking antbird with a strong affinity for water. Medium-sized and chunky with a rather long bill. Male is medium-gray with a white throat and white spotting on the wings. Note the messy scaly appearance on the breast.

Widespread and reasonably common throughout much of lowland northern South America, east of the Andes. Almost always found in pairs near the edge of rivers or lakes in lowland forest."
0,Silvereye,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Zosterops lateralis,https://ebird.org/species/silver3,"Tiny bird with an obvious pale eyering. Subspecies vary in plumage; most have a green head, green lores (area between bill and eye), yellowish throat, gray (or green) back, pale gray underparts, and green wings and tail. The migratory Tasmanian subspecies has brownish flanks. Rather common, seen in small flocks that feed in bushes and shrubs in the mid-story. The only species of white-eye over much of its range."
0,Silvery Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps occipitalis,https://ebird.org/species/silgre1,"Widespread, small pale grebe of lakes and reservoirs, often with no surrounding vegetation; nests mainly in colonies, locally by the hundreds. The southern population also occurs in coastal waters in winter. Often looks mostly white at a distance, unlike the darker White-tufted Grebe. The southern population has a silvery-blond hood (reduced in young and nonbreeding birds) and a grayish throat while the northern Andean population has a blond-streaked cap, a white throat, and looks the same year-round. Also note vocal differences between southern and northern populations."
0,Silvery Wood-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba argentina,https://ebird.org/species/siwpig1,"Beautiful grayish-white pigeon with black wing- and tail-tips.

0,Singing Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Dactylortyx thoracicus,https://ebird.org/species/sinqua1,"Small, retiring quail of forest understory. Rarely seen, but can be located by listening for noisy rustling in the leaf litter as birds scratch like chickens. Prefers to run away rather than flush. Loud song often reveals its presence, given mainly early and late in the day: first few notes similar to Little Tinamou song, but then breaks into rollicking choruses that can be almost deafening if close by. Male has rusty face and gray body, female colors reversed, with gray face and rusty body."
0,Singing Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Aplonis cantoroides,https://ebird.org/species/sinsta1,"Large songbird of New Guinea and Solomon Islands, also on Boigu Island in the northern Torres Strait.

Teardrop-shaped dark patch around each eye gives it a distinctly fashionable, elegant appearance. Forages on or close to the ground in the dense undergrowth of dry forests and scrubby areas. Scurries or flaps laboriously away when disturbed."
0,Sjöstedt's Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Baeopogon clamans,https://ebird.org/species/sjogre1,"A unusual dark greenbul often found near water in the forest interior. Decorated in various shades of dark and olive green, with a gray throat that contrasts with the breast, a buffy belly, and bright white sides of the tail. Can be confused with both Honeyguide Greenbul and actual honeyguides, but the flight is direct rather than undulating, the throat contrasts with the breast, the eyes are always dark, and the vocalizations are distinctive. Can be located by its “REHR!” calls, often followed by a series of fast, scratchy notes and sometimes repeated for minutes on end."
0,Sladen's Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Lybiidae,Gymnobucco sladeni,https://ebird.org/species/slabar1,"Dark, chunky barbet with an odd tuft of buff feathers on its forehead. Usually found in small groups on and around dead trees in lowland rainforest, gallery forest, and secondary growth. Sometimes occurs alongside Gray-throated Barbet.

0,Slaty Becard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Pachyramphus spodiurus,https://ebird.org/species/slabec1,"This flycatcher-like bird of western Ecuador and northwestern Peru can be tough to identify with certainty due to its similarity with the slightly larger One-colored Becard. On male, look for white fringes to some of the wing feathers and a faint, pale spot between the eye and bill. On female, this pale spot is harder to see, but she tends to have a warmer, more tawny-colored breast. Voice is also a good clue: Slaty Becard often gives a ringing, raspy trill. Most common in dry and semi-humid forest but also locally found in humid forest."
0,Slaty Bristlefront,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Merulaxis ater,https://ebird.org/species/slabri1,"Odd-looking terrestrial species with a long tail and a small tufty crest. Found in the understory of humid and montane forests and is rarely easy to see.

0,Smoky Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus fuligiventer,https://ebird.org/species/smowar1,"Dark sooty leaf warbler with a pale brow stripe and no wingbars. Yellow wash to the underparts tends to be absent in worn birds. Extremely similar in appearance to Dusky Warbler, which averages larger and darker overall, and has a longer, brighter brow stripe. Breeds in scrubby areas above the treeline and moves downhill into shrubby and grassy foothill and lowland areas. Forages low on the ground, often around rocks or water. Song is a repetitive series of liquid notes. Calls are dry, hard “chuck” or “tick” notes."
0,Snail Kite,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Rostrhamus sociabilis,https://ebird.org/species/snakit,"Unique snail-eating raptor. Widespread and fairly common in Central and South America, but very limited range in U.S. Found exclusively around lakes and marshes with plenty of vegetation. Adult male is entirely dark gray with red eyes, orange feet and base of bill, briefly turning red in breeding season. Females and immatures are streaky brown. Note very sharply hooked bill, long broad wings, and short dark tail with a white base above and below. Look for pairs or small groups flying over marshes with slow, buoyant wingbeats. Frequently perches on bushes."
0,Snares Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes robustus,https://ebird.org/species/snapen1,"Medium-sized crested penguin, endemic to New Zealand. Note the thin, vivid yellow eyebrow that droops behind the eye to form a bushy tufted crest. Also look for prominent pale pink skin at the base of its chunky red bill. Breeds in colonies only on the Snare Islands. Adults disperse widely in winter. Vagrants recorded molting around South, Stewart, Chatham, and Subantarctic Islands. Forages in small groups at sea. Distinguished from Fiordland Penguin by conspicuous pale pink skin at the base of the larger bill and the lack of white cheek stripes. Told apart from Erect-crested Penguin by crest beginning toward the top of the bill and splaying out more dramatically. Rockhopper Penguin is smaller."
0,Snares Island Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Coenocorypha huegeli,https://ebird.org/species/snisni1,"A small, stocky wader endemic to New Zealand. Dark brown and black, with barred feathers on the belly. Native to on the Snares Islands, but introduced to Putauhina and Codfish Islands.

0,Snethlage's Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Hylopezus paraensis,https://ebird.org/species/spoant5,"Plump, almost tailless, cryptically-plumaged bird with an orange eyering. Has a gray crown, an olive-green back, and white underparts with rusty flanks and a black-streaked breast. Inhabits humid, usually undisturbed forest with a fairly dense understory. Forages quietly by hopping on the forest floor. The song is a series of typically six deep, hurried hollow notes: “hoor-hoor-hoor-hoor-ho-ho.” The similar Spotted and Alta Floresta Antipttas are very difficult to tell apart, with similar songs which vary in the number of notes, but their ranges don’t overlap."
0,Snoring Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Aramidopsis plateni,https://ebird.org/species/plarai1,"A large, little-known flightless rail from Sulawesi. Note the heavy bill, orange in females, duller in males, and the tailless appearance. Gray with an orange nape and contrastingly rufous wings. Note dense barring on belly. A rarely seen terrestrial bird of densely-vegetated forest floor in lowlands and foothills; sometimes occurs in nearby dense scrub too. Much larger and heavier-billed than Slaty-breasted Rail, and further differs in showing conspicuous rufous wings. Vocalizations include a low-pitched “mmmm” and wheezing and snoring noises."
0,Snow Mountain Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Synoicus monorthonyx,https://ebird.org/species/snmqua2,"A huge quail of alpine grasslands. Plump, yellow bill and legs, black bars and white streaks on the back. Female has distinctive, black-edged, white arrow marks on the chest whereas the male has a black barred chest with deep rufous throat and underparts. No other quails share the habitat, and the only thing that might cause confusion when flushed would be a woodcock or snipe which have long bills. Flushes in a loud whir of wings while giving a high squealing call."
0,Snow Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Calcariidae,Plectrophenax nivalis,https://ebird.org/species/snobun,Bold black-and-white wing patches are distinctive in flight. Breeds on tundra at northern latitudes; forms flocks in the winter and moves south. Nonbreeding birds are overall white below with warm brown and orange tones on head and back. During the breeding season they are white with black or gray on the back. Often forms mixed flocks with other field birds in the winter.
0,Snow Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anser caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/snogoo,"Medium-sized goose with two strikingly different color morphs. White morph generally more common. Adults have black wingtips, pink bill and legs, and often show yellowish staining on the head. Juveniles have dull brownish bill and legs and variable grayish smudging on body and wings. Dark morph adults are dark slaty-gray with a white face; juveniles are entirely dark. Typically found in flocks, sometimes numbering into the thousands, but individuals may be found with other geese species. Occurs in fields, marshes, and lakes during migration and winter; breeds on Arctic tundra. Compare with Ross’s Goose, which is like a cuter miniature version of Snow Goose. Pay attention to the bill: Snow Goose has a longer bill with a more curved border where it meets the face, and a more pronounced dark “grin patch” (but beware, Ross’s can show a small grin patch too!)."
0,Snow Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lerwa lerwa,https://ebird.org/species/snopar1,"A stone-colored terrestrial bird of stony hillsides, mountain ridges, and meadows above treeline. Adults speckled gray and white above, with dense rusty streaking on white underparts, red bill, and deep red legs. Usually forages in small groups, often in very exposed areas such as cliff sides and rocky ridges. Song, often given by multiple birds in a group simultaneously, is high-pitched and has a slippery, squeaky quality like wet shoes on tile; male song louder and ascending, female’s softer and descending."
0,Snow Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pagodroma nivea,https://ebird.org/species/snopet1,"An unmistakable dreamlike vision of a bird, whiter than the snowy Antarctic peaks and glaciers against which it flies.

Plumage entirely white (somehow remarkably clean given its habits) with a naked pale pinkish face and a pale green and orange bill. Flies strongly with stiff wingbeats; does not alight on water, but will hitch rides on ships."
0,Sociable Lapwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Vanellus gregarius,https://ebird.org/species/soclap1,"A rare shorebird of semi-arid steppes, rangelands, and open country. Brown-gray tones above with a prominent head pattern—a pale supercilium bordered by a dark eye-stripe and crown. In summer plumage the upper belly is dark. In flight shows a three-toned wing pattern of brown, black, and white similar to White-tailed Lapwing, but note the dark-tipped tail on Sociable Lapwing and the dark (not yellow) legs."
0,Sociable Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Philetairus socius,https://ebird.org/species/socwea1,"A small, dumpy buff-and-brown weaver with a blue-gray bill, a dark bib, and scaly patterning on the back and flanks. Juveniles are duller, lacking the bib and scaling. It is restricted to open arid country, where hundreds can breed colonially in gigantic grass nests that are placed in trees or on man-made structures. Small to large groups forage on the ground, hopping and running after insects and seeds. The Scaly Weaver is smaller than the Sociable Weaver, is far less gregarious, and has a pinkish bill."
0,Social Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiozetetes similis,https://ebird.org/species/socfly1,"Looks like a mini version of Boat-billed Flycatcher; in particular note Social’s small bill.

Found on the island of Socotra, where it inhabits arid habitats with trees, including palms. Most often detected by voice: two or three quiet introductory “phut” notes followed by a resonant “prreuup”, often repeating, sometimes for long periods. This is the only small owl known from Socotra, though the migratory Eurasian Scops-Owl might occur. Best distinguished by voice, though Socotra Scops-Owl is smaller and paler, with smaller ear tufts."
0,Socotra Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer insularis,https://ebird.org/species/socspa1,"Typical “rufous sparrow”, with a striped back and a gray crown, nape, and rump. Males have a black bib, and are brighter overall, with more rufous on the face and shoulder. Endemic to the island of Socotra, where it inhabits a range of habitats including rocky areas, dry woodland, scrub, and human settlements. The call is a cheerful “chirp”, often given in a slow series, similar to other sparrows. Similar to Abd al Kuri Sparrow, but separated by range."
0,Socotra Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Onychognathus frater,https://ebird.org/species/socsta1,"Large, glossy black starling with a strong bill. The tail is moderately long, and squared off. There are large red panels in the wing, which are conspicuous in flight. Unlike most “red-winged” starlings, sexes are alike. Often found around cliffs and other rocky areas, where it roosts and nests. Feeds in dry woodland. Gives scratchy calls and more musical whistles. Similar to male Somali Starling, but has a much shorter and less pointed tail. Easily distinguished from the gray-hooded female Somali Starling."
0,Socotra Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Chalcomitra balfouri,https://ebird.org/species/socsun2,"Odd and distinctive sunbird in which both sexes have a female-like plumage. Shows brown upperparts, pale underparts with black scaling and streaking, a black throat, and white whiskers. There are small yellow tufts at the shoulders, which can be hidden.

Gray-brown above and pale gray below, sometimes showing a brighter rufous coloration crown. Found in most habitats with trees and bushes, ranging from grassland dotted with shrubs to fairly lush woodland. Often runs on the ground, and sometimes cocks up the tail. Vocalizations include harsh “tek” notes and a fast, high-pitched trill of very dry notes. Within its range, can only be confused with Socotra Cisticola, but easily distinguished by the darker and duller coloration, without streaking on the crown or back."
0,Sokoke Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus sokokensis,https://ebird.org/species/sokpip1,"A rare small pipit found in a limited region of the East African coast, where it is very local in coastal forest. Rich rufous-brown above and white below with bold streaking on the breast. Inconspicuous, spending most of its time on the ground, although it will perch in trees, especially when disturbed. Found in forest, like Tree Pipit, but more richly colored on the back and paler on the face and belly. The call is a high-pitched, descending whistle; the song, given in flight, consists of a simple series of whistles."

0,Solitary Black Cacique,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Cacicus solitarius,https://ebird.org/species/sobcac1,"Black cacique with a creamy white bill. Forages in dense waterside vegetation around oxbow lakes, marshes, and slow-moving rivers. Dark eye distinguishes it from similar Ecuadorian and Yellow-billed Caciques, which have light eyes. Entirely black plumage distinguishes it from other caciques; habitat is another good clue. Larger and lankier with a longer bill than other blackbirds, like Giant Cowbird and Pale-eyed Blackbird."
0,Solitary Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteogallus solitarius,https://ebird.org/species/soleag1,"Rare. Very large, short-tailed eagle of highland and foothill forest. Like many hawks, soars mainly in late morning and is very rarely seen perched. Many reports of Solitary Eagle refer to misidentified Common Black Hawk, which also has blackish plumage and a single white tail band on its short tail. The eagle is much larger, with thicker legs, and feet that almost reach the tail tip in flight. Adult Solitary is slaty gray (vs. blackish on Black Hawks). Immature has diffusely patterned brownish tail and dark thighs, unlike black hawks."

0,Somali Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza poliopleura,https://ebird.org/species/sombun1,"A beautiful bunting of dry country. Note the black-and-white facial pattern, the gray back with russet streaks, the gray rump, and the yellow breast with pale sides. Found in dry thorn savanna, often in pairs. Similar to Golden-breasted Bunting, but found in drier habitat, and range overlap is minimal; look for Somali Bunting’s overall paler coloration, narrower black stripes on the face, grayer back and rump, and pale sides. The song is usually a short series of the same two-note whistled phrase, repeated. One call is a long, ascending whistle."
0,Somali Courser,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Glareolidae,Cursorius somalensis,https://ebird.org/species/somcou1,"A plain, pale courser with black lines behind the eyes that make a “V” when seen from behind. In flight, the wings are partially black with a white trailing edge. Found in dry savanna, thornscrub, and desert. Usually in small groups, which tend to flee from disturbance on foot. Very similar to Cream-colored Courser, but browner and shorter-winged, with partially pale rather than completely black underwings in flight. Fairly similar to Temminck’s Courser, but paler overall, lacks chestnut in the crown, and has a paler underwing. Calls include a quiet “whit” and a louder “trow.”"

Found in a variety of dry country habitats, including savanna, thornscrub, desert, towns, and cultivated areas. Often in small flocks. Similar to Fan-tailed Raven, but has a different shape, especially in flight, with a much longer tail. Very similar to Brown-necked Raven, but smaller, and there is little overlap in range. Typical birds look very different from Pied Crow, but these two species sometimes hybridize, producing birds with white blotching on the back and underparts. The calls are typical rough cawing notes."
0,Somali Fiscal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius somalicus,https://ebird.org/species/somfis1,"A small black, white, and gray shrike. The sexes look similar. Note the white patches at the bottom middle and near the end of the wing. Along with the white outer tail, these can be conspicuous in flight. Found in dry savanna and grassland.

In flight it shows a blue-gray rump, dark wing edges, and a dark banded tail. Pairs and small flocks are uncommon and local residents and nomads, restricted to cliffs and hills near the northern Somali coastline, preferring dry areas devoid of vegetation. Within Somali Pigeon’s range, the much darker and more heavily spotted Speckled Pigeon is expanding; smaller collared-doves all have a dark band on the hind-neck. Somali Pigeon’s vocalizations are poorly known but described as “wuk-wuk-wuk-ooooh” and other pigeon-like sounds."
0,Somali Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer castanopterus,https://ebird.org/species/somspa1,"The equivalent of House Sparrow in dry parts of the Horn of Africa. Males have a chestnut crown and nape, a black bib, and a variable pale yellowish wash on the cheeks and underparts. Females are very dull, but usually also show a yellow wash below. Found in dry habitats including dry thorn savanna, thorn scrub, desert, and coastal cliffs, often around human habitation. Visually similar to House Sparrow, but separated by the yellow wash, and the male is further separated by the chestnut rather than gray crown. Also similar to rufous sparrows, but the male is separated from those species by his chestnut crown, and the female by her much drabber coloration.

Shows a distinctive red eye, long thick reddish bill, and thick pale-pink feet and legs. Found breeding along braided riverbeds, pastures, and lakes in the South Island of New Zealand, with a few breeding records on the North Island. Most of the population migrates north to estuaries, harbors, and sandy beaches in the North Island and northern South Island. Regular vagrant to Australia during the winter. Often heard giving distinct “kleep” call. Similar to pied-morph Variable Oystercatcher in New Zealand; look for SIPO’s smaller size, sharp border between black and white on lower chest, and extensive white on rump and back. Distinguished from Pied Oystercatcher in Australia by smaller size, longer and thinner bill, shorter legs, and more extensive white up the back and on the wings."

Constantly moves noisily as it restlessly forages on the floor and through the canopy. Flicks over leaves and digs into rotting logs with its strong bill in search of invertebrates. Distinguished from Eurasian Blackbird by chestnut saddle and wattles."

0,South Melanesian Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina caledonica,https://ebird.org/species/melcus1,"A large cuckooshrike with uniformly matte slaty-black plumage and a very striking pale eye. Long-tailed, with a relatively stubby bill. Resident in forests, usually in foothills and lowlands, especially coastal forest. Unlikely to be confused. Most common call is an ascending whistle, often followed by a shrill “kwa-kwawa-kwawa.”"
0,South Moluccan Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Erythropitta rubrinucha,https://ebird.org/species/sompit1,"An unmistakable plump, short-tailed, long-legged forest bird with a red belly. A spectacular species displaying a broad iridescent blue chest band, a dark purplish-glossed head with blue cheek markings, a reddish nape, and moss-green upperparts. Found in forested lowlands and foothills and within bamboo thickets. Usually seen singly, most often either foraging on the forest floor or calling from low understory branches. Confined to the islands of Buru and Seram. Gives a distinctive soft, quivering two-part whistle: “waaaaaaaoop-aaaaaaww.” First part ascends, and the second is a mournful, descending whistle."
0,South Polar Skua,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Stercorariidae,Stercorarius maccormicki,https://ebird.org/species/sopsku1,"Bulky cold-brown seabird with white wing flashes. Usually seen singly in strong and direct flight, sometimes resting on the ocean with rafts of shearwaters. Chases gulls, large shearwaters, and even boobies, forcing them to regurgitate their food. Plumage overall rather plain, dark gray-brown, suggesting a muscular immature gull but with big white wing flashes, like the smaller, more lightly built jaegers. Often shows a pale blaze across the nape. Some birds have very pale blonde head and body. Breeds in Antarctica, further south than almost any other species of bird. Ranges across all oceans, mainly from March to October, typically staying offshore and very rarely seen from land. Compare with other skua species. In North Atlantic, Great Skua is warmer-toned, has a more capped or hooded appearance, and adults have golden spangles on upperparts. Separation from Brown Skua in Southern Hemisphere is more problematic; there are multiple populations of Brown Skuas and hybrids with South Polar are quite frequent! South Polar averages smaller-billed and slightly less bulky than Brown, and never has bold streaks or spangles on upperparts, but many birds are best left unidentified."
0,Southern Marquesan Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus mendanae,https://ebird.org/species/marwar2,"A medium-sized reed warbler, bright yellow below and tawny above, with pale-edged black wing feathers. Bill long and slightly downcurved, giving the bird a very “long-headed” appearance. Found in scrubby areas and plantations, avoiding deep primary forest. Call is a harsh “tchak.” Song is a mix of whistles, churring, warbling, and rasping scold notes."
0,Southern Antpipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Corythopis delalandi,https://ebird.org/species/souant1,"Medium-sized odd-looking, ground-walking flycatcher of humid forests and second growth. Unmistakable in most of its range with its olive-brown back, yellow bill, white face and belly, and black breast. Told from Ringed Antpipit, for which there is barely any distributional overlap, by being paler and less olive above with a creamier chin and throat. Generally shy but its song is very distinct: a melodic series of explosive “preeeh-prrrwee-prurr-prii” notes. Also makes loud bill-snapping noises."
0,Southern Bald Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Geronticus calvus,https://ebird.org/species/balibi1,"A large, striking, dark ibis with a past- pale face and red legs, crown, and bill. The immature is duller, lacking red coloration. Small-to-medium-sized flocks forage for large insects and small animals in high-altitude grassland between 1200 and 1800 m, preferring short grass and recently burnt areas. It breeds in nearby rocky gorges and cliffs. Hadada Ibis is dark, and it may be confused for Southern Bald Ibis in flight, but Hadada Ibis has a thicker neck and less streamlined head."
0,Southern Beardless-Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Camptostoma obsoletum,https://ebird.org/species/sobtyr1,"Small flycatcher, common and widespread from Costa Rica to Argentina. Plumage is nondescript (and quite variable across range), but note bushy crest, active behavior, short bill, and plain face. Singles, pairs, or small groups can be found in a variety of wooded habitats, from dry scrub to the edge of mature rainforest, but often prefers second growth. Voice varies across range, with different populations probably representing separate species. Northern birds give plaintive whistled “teew, teew, teew” notes. Southern birds can give much different descending sputtering trill in addition to plaintive whistles."
0,Southern Bentbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Oncostoma olivaceum,https://ebird.org/species/souben1,"A tiny well-named flycatcher with a distinctive bent bill like a broken nose. It is olive-green above with paler yellowish underparts. Note the pale gray eyes. Inconspicuous; typically seen singly in the understory of lowland forest, edge, and second-growth. Best detected by trilling calls. Occurs from Panama to Colombia; no range overlap with similar Northern Bentbill."
0,Southern Black-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis pammelaina,https://ebird.org/species/sobfly1,"A slim and lustrous glossy-black flycatcher with upright posture, dark brown eyes, and a straight-edged square tail. Females are less glossy, and juveniles are spotted brown. Singles, pairs, or small groups frequent woodland, savanna, forest edge, and parkland, where they join mixed-species flocks. This species perches on branches and either pounces to the ground to hunt prey or pursues passing insects; it often associates with Fork-tailed Drongo, which it may imitate. The call is a three-note “tseeep-tsoo-tsoo.” The similar Fork-tailed Drongo differs by having red eyes and a forked tail, and Northern Black-Flycatcher differs by having dull matte black rather than glossy plumage."
0,Southern Black-Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Melaniparus niger,https://ebird.org/species/soublt1,"A large, active, noisy black tit with white shoulders, white edgings to the wing feathers, and a barred gray-and-white undertail. Pairs and small groups form the core of mixed-species feeding flocks in broadleaf woodland and thorn scrub. The species is often detected by its noisy buzzing and chirping vocalizations, including a sweet-and-scratchy “diddy-dzee-dzee-dzee-dzee-dzee.” The very similar Carp’s Tit is black under the tail; ranges only narrowly overlap."
0,Southern Boubou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius ferrugineus,https://ebird.org/species/soubou1,"A plump, dark-backed bushshrike with a creamy throat; buff-rufous flanks, thighs and belly; and a striking white stripe on the dark wing. The female is duller and less glossy than the male. Pairs are shy and skulking residents of thickets and tangles in fynbos, forest, and woodland. The species forages furtively by creeping stealthily and hopping slowly, close to the ground. Normally boubous are first detected by their loud distinctive ringing duets: “wheeet-whee-do-do-do”; their single loud “wheee” notes; and a rattling scold like the vibrating of a seed-pod shaker. The similar Tropical Boubou has paler underparts than the Southern Boubou."
0,Southern Bristle-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phylloscartes eximius,https://ebird.org/species/sobtyr2,"Tiny and strikingly-plumaged flycatcher with a long tail and distinct face pattern.

0,Southern Brown Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx australis,https://ebird.org/species/sobkiw1,"The largest of New Zealand’s kiwis. A reddish to dark brown kiwi with brown to black streaking. Inhabits native forest, tussock grassland, and neighboring farmland. Mostly nocturnal, with some day foraging observed on Stewart Island and certain locations in Fiordland. Restricted to the mountains near Haast, Fiordland, Stewart Island, and sanctuaries. Foraging produces clear audible sniffling. Males give a series of clear rising whistles while females give a harsh throaty wail. Both sexes repeat their call many times. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Southern Cassowary,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Casuariiformes,Casuariidae,Casuarius casuarius,https://ebird.org/species/soucas1,"Enormous flightless bird with dark glossy plumage and large, horn-like plate on colorful head with two red neck wattles. Unlikely to be confused with other species. Hatchlings are brown and strongly striped. Juvenile and Immature birds are similar to adults but browner and with an absent or developing head-plate. Found in dense tropical rainforest, where it can be seen crossing roads, or along roadsides."
0,Southern Citril,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Crithagra hyposticta,https://ebird.org/species/soucit1,"Small seedeater with a sharp bill and forked tail. The upperparts are olive-green and the underparts pale yellow with some streaking. Males and females are similar. Found at middle and high elevations in a variety of habitats, including forest edge, gardens, cultivation, moist scrub, and woodland. Usually in small flocks. The song is a fast jumble of high-pitched twitters and whistles. Similar to Western Citril, but there is virtually no overlap in range, and further separated by the lack of a strong pale eyebrow, and the lack of a black face on the male."
0,Southern Emuwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Stipiturus malachurus,https://ebird.org/species/souemu1,"A tiny, buff-brown bird with an enormously long tail. Tail is much longer and far more spindly than that of fairywrens. Females have dark streaks on the crown and back and are a warm buffy-brown underneath. Males are the similar, except they have a sky-blue throat. Typically very shy, they live in coastal heath-land in southern Australia and are unlikely to be seen unless you are actively looking for them."
0,Southern Fiscal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius collaris,https://ebird.org/species/soufis1,"A common black-and-white shrike of open country that perches upright. Singles and pairs are conspicuous on perches 1 to 10 meters above the ground in grassland, light and dense woodland, savanna, and modified habitats. They perch for extended periods and swoop down on insects and small vertebrates that they catch on the ground; these are sometimes impaled on thorns and stored for later consumption. The underparts of the similar Northern Fiscal are cleaner and whiter than the dingy gray underparts of the Southern Fiscal."

0,Southern Giant-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Macronectes giganteus,https://ebird.org/species/angpet1,"Widespread and fairly common; readily seen from shore and ferries in Tierra del Fuego. Giant-Petrels are known as vultures of the Southern Ocean and can scavenge with gulls at sewage outflows or with albatrosses at fishing boats; often follows ships. Very large (size of smaller albatross) with a very big pale bill that always has a diagnostic pale greenish tip. Plumage varies; most birds are dark overall or with whitish head, rarely whitish head and underparts; scarce white morph is snow-white overall with scattered black feathers."
0,Southern Ground-Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucorvidae,Bucorvus leadbeateri,https://ebird.org/species/soghor1,"This enormous, sociable, ground-loving hornbill is easily recognized. The adult male has an extensive brilliant red face and throat wattles, while the adult female has purple-blue skin in the center of the red throat patch. The immature is scruffy with yellowish facial skin. In flight, this huge bird is black with extensive white wingtips. Family groups walk slowly through bushy savanna and grassland, foraging for large invertebrates and small vertebrates. In the early morning, dominant pairs duet with a deep-bass booming, “oooh..oooh..ooh-oh”, which can be heard several kilometers away."
0,Southern Hill Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Gracula indica,https://ebird.org/species/sohmyn1,"Glossy black myna of southern India and Sri Lanka. Note white wing patches, bright orange bill, and yellow head wattles. Inhabits foothill forests, where it is most often encountered high up in the canopy in pairs or small flocks. Gives various croaks and screams, but is less vocally accomplished than the very similar Common Hill Myna, which does not overlap in range."
0,Southern Hyliota,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hyliotidae,Hyliota australis,https://ebird.org/species/souhyl1,"Mid-sized, generic-looking warbler-like bird. Males have a matte black back, a white wing patch, and very pale yellowish underparts. Females are similar, but browner on the back. Found mainly in broadleaf savanna, and locally in humid forest. Usually in pairs or small groups, which will join mixed-species feeding flocks. The quiet vocalizations include chatty calls and trills. Very similar to Yellow-bellied Hyliota. In most of the range, Southern males distinguished by the smaller white patch on the wing, and females by their browner upperparts. In Uganda and Kenya, males are extremely similar, but Southern can still be recognized by its non-glossy black back."
0,Southern Lapwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Vanellus chilensis,https://ebird.org/species/soulap1,"Raucous, conspicuous shorebird. Distinctive color pattern with black breast, white belly, gray head, and bronzy shoulder. Wings boldly patterned in flight.

Males are deep iridescent purple; females are also entirely dark, but are brownish below, with faint scaling. Migrates within South America; at some times of year, occurs with other very similar martin species, making identification difficult. Females lack the light belly of similar Purple and Gray-breasted Martins; males essentially indistinguishable from Purple Martin."
0,Southern Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus velatus,https://ebird.org/species/afmwea,"This red-eyed masked-weaver has a lightly streaked green back and pink-brown legs. The breeding male has a black face mask with a narrow black band on the forehead above the bill. The female and juvenile are dull. The species is an abundant resident throughout open savanna and semi-arid areas, nesting colonially above water or in large trees. Many similar-looking weavers do not overlap in range. The larger and more robust male Village Weaver differs from Southern Masked-Weaver by having a more mottled back; the female Village Weaver has a stouter, more robust bill and a duller red eye."
0,Southern Pied-Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Turdoides bicolor,https://ebird.org/species/sopbab1,"A striking black-and-white babbler lacking any facial markings. Groups of 3-15 range through arid savanna, preferring areas with thorn trees, where they associate with Red-billed Buffalo-Weaver and Crimson-breasted Gonolek. The species gives a high-pitched aggravated babbling in group chorus. The similar Bare-cheeked Babbler differs from the Southern Pied-Babbler by having bare black skin patches near the eye and a rufous nape."
0,Southern Pochard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Netta erythrophthalma,https://ebird.org/species/soupoc1,Very dark-looking duck with a broad white wing band that is visible in flight.

0,Southern Red Bishop,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Euplectes orix,https://ebird.org/species/redbis,"A small, dumpy sparrow-like weaver. The breeding male is a mix of velvety vermilion and black; the narrow black forecrown is diagnostic. The female and non-breeding male are nondescript, with a short tail and strong buff eyebrow, and are difficult to tell apart from other bishops. Pairs and small flocks are always close to water when breeding, and mixed-species colonies occur in reedbeds and swampy grassland, but they disperse into adjacent scrub in the non-breeding season, often in flocks. The song is an extended fizzling sizzle. Breeding males of other red bishop species either have no black forehead, or have a much more extensive black crown."
0,Southern Rockhopper Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes chrysocome,https://ebird.org/species/rocpen1,"The smallest of the crested penguins.

Occurs in small, sociable groups in forest edge, savanna, thickets in grassland, and gardens, feeding on fruit, leaves, flowers, and nectar. After eating, birds may hang upside-down and expose the black skin on their bellies to absorb heat and aid digestion."
0,Speckled Piculet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picumnus innominatus,https://ebird.org/species/spepic1,"Unique tiny woodpecker with olive-yellow wings, brown-and-white striped head, and black-spotted white breast and belly. Other piculets in range look very different, being mostly unmarked. Call is an extremely high “tsik tsik tsik.” Drums very loudly for such a diminutive bird. Widespread, found in lowland and foothill forests, often in areas with bamboo stands."
0,Speckled Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba guinea,https://ebird.org/species/spepig1,"Big, dark pigeon with white spots across the shoulder and a big red patch of bare skin around the eye. In flight, shows a gray tail band and rump. Found in many different open habitats, and nests in towns and cities and on cliffs. Only absent from thick forest. Common vocalizations are a “rrrour” call and an accelerating series of hoots. Somewhat similar to Rameron Pigeon, but largely absent from forest, and shows much larger wing spots and red rather than yellow bare facial skin."
0,Speckled Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Coturnicops notatus,https://ebird.org/species/sperai1,"Very rare and poorly known, but likely widely overlooked, small rail of the southern cone from SE Brazil to central Argentina. Its secretive nature makes it difficult to understand its habitat and habits, but timing of records, combined with records from the middle of downtown Buenos Aires and São Paolo, suggest it is at least somewhat migratory."
0,Speckled Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Cranioleuca gutturata,https://ebird.org/species/spespi1,"Fairly small, long-tailed reddish-and-tan bird. Light brown body, with reddish tail, wings, and crown, and prominent fine black spotting in the face and breast. Usually forages singly or in pairs in the midstory of mature or secondary rainforest, often with mixed-species flocks. Tail appears very reddish, even from below; smaller than similar foliage-gleaners, which are often present in the same flocks. Its song is an often overlooked, even-paced series of very high notes."

0,Spectacled Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Rubigula erythropthalmos,https://ebird.org/species/spebul1,"Dull brown bulbul; paler below than above. Thin orangish eyering around the bright red eye is diagnostic, but not always easy to see. Very similar in appearance to slightly larger Red-eyed Bulbul, as well as to the red-eyed Bornean form of Cream-vented Bulbul; Spectacled is best separated by its combination of stronger contrast of the gray-washed head and breast with the rufous-brown wings and rump. Throat coloration of Spectacled is intermediate between the starkly pale throat of Cream-vented and the brown-suffused throat of Red-eyed, and its bill appears smaller and sharper than in the former two species. Song is a jumble of cricket-like chirping and harsh scratchy notes. Calls are a bright and bubbly series of notes--“pi-di-pi-pi-di-di”--sometimes with a descending meow at the end. Inhabits lowland and foothill forests, usually found in more mature growth than Cream-vented and Red-eyed Bulbuls."

0,Spotted Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Locustella thoracica,https://ebird.org/species/spobuw3,"Furtive brown warbler. Brown above and pale below, with a striped vent. Namesake spotting is variable; Himalayan birds have a necklace of dark spots, while central Chinese birds have a much lighter stippled patch on the chest. Extremely difficult to tell apart from non-singing Baikal Bush Warbler where the two overlap: in Spotted, look for a stronger gray wash on the neck and chest, and warmer-toned upperparts. Sichuan and Chinese Bush Warblers can also be similar, but average more warmly-colored, with plainer underparts.

Restricted to Javanese highlands, where it can be found in pristine forests, as well as degraded forest and forest edge. Frequently a member of mixed-species flocks. Gives various high twittering notes, often in series."
0,Sunda Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Horornis vulcanius,https://ebird.org/species/subwar4,"Small, drab, brown warbler. Like most bush-warblers, shy and more easily heard than seen; listen for its song, a strange, twisting, oddly cartoonish, descending whistle: “whEWWeeWWew-WI!”. If seen, note dirt-brown plumage, pale eyebrow, grayish face and throat, and relatively long tail. Altitudinal range varies; found at higher elevations on larger islands. Scrounges about in dense vegetation in forests, forest edge, and scrubby areas."
0,Sunda Collared-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Streptopelia bitorquata,https://ebird.org/species/iscdov1,"Medium-sized pinkish-brown dove with bright red eyes. “Collar” is black with a white upper margin.

0,Sunda Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus nigrorufus,https://ebird.org/species/suncou1,"Uncommon and localized Javan endemic, restricted to coastal marshes, mangroves, estuaries, and adjacent scrubby and grassy growth. Black overall, with bright red eyes and patchy rufous-and-black wings. Also note huge, heavy bill with a hooked tip. Not as vocal as other coucals; infrequently gives a monotonous series of hoots which averages faster than that of Greater Coucal. Forages on the ground and in dense vegetation, only occasionally emerging into the open."
0,Sunda Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Cuculus lepidus,https://ebird.org/species/suncuc2,"Typical Cuculus cuckoo: most adults are gray with black stripes on a white breast and belly, but some females are “hepatic”; they appear rufous overall with extensive barring. Virtually identical to Himalayan and Oriental cuckoos, which migrate through and winter in Sunda’s range; look for Sunda’s more contrasting darker gray upperparts, wider bars on the underparts, and buffier unmarked vent. Juvenile is dark grayish black above with white edging to the feathers. Like most cuckoos, more often heard than seen; listen for its 2–3 note hooting song, which averages higher than that of Oriental. A species of montane and foothill forest."
0,Sunda Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina larvata,https://ebird.org/species/suncus1,"Chunky, dark gray bird with a dark face. Dark face patch is more extensive on males than females; males on Sumatra have entirely black heads. Inhabits moist foothill and montane forest. Moves through the upper levels of forest, often with other species in mixed flocks. Gives various high squeaky calls, including an inflected “weee-tee!”."
0,Sunda Forktail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Enicurus velatus,https://ebird.org/species/sunfor1,"Elegant mountain stream specialist, endemic to Java and Sumatra. Typically encountered foraging alongside narrow and fast-moving forest waterways at 600-2000 meters. Dark gray above and white below, with a dark throat and slender white stripe around the forehead. Males have a gray crown, while females have a dark maroon one (difficult to see in poor lighting). Also note bright white rump. White-crowned Forktail is significantly larger, with white wingbars and a larger white forehead patch. Calls loudly, especially when alarmed, giving high thin whistles. Often bobs tail."
0,Sunda Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus cornutus,https://ebird.org/species/sunfro1,"Small frogmouth with piercing yellow eyes. Found in lowland and lower foothill forest, plantations, and forest edge. Both sexes are variable, but males average more strongly-patterned while females are more often rufous. White patterning on the underparts and wings varies between discrete “scales” and blotchy patches. Similar Blyth’s Frogmouth has less extensive white in its plumage, whereas Bornean and Sumatran frogmouths (both of which favor higher elevations than Sunda) are shorter-tailed; in addition, the latter has much more white on the underparts. Gives a harsh, grating caw, as well as clear whistles and a brief rolling series of harsh notes."
0,Sunda Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Garrulax palliatus,https://ebird.org/species/sunlau1,"Forest laughingthrush of montane and submontane areas. Slate-gray head and chest, chestnut wings and tail. Pale blue eyering gives it a startled appearance. Forages close to or on the ground, noisily flipping leaf litter. Also visits campsites and trailheads like Chestnut-hooded Laughingthrush, but Sunda is comparatively shier. Raucous song starts off with a few distinct hooting notes and promptly descends into a jumble of chaotic noise, often giving away its presence in the undergrowth. Also gives squeaky yelps, quieter “chup” notes, and dry rattles."
0,Sunda Minivet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Pericrocotus miniatus,https://ebird.org/species/sunmin1,"Brightly-colored and long-tailed inhabitant of foothill and montane forests in Java and Sumatra (1200-2700 meters). Social, often traveling in large flocks in the forest canopy. Male is very similar to other male minivets; note extensive and contiguous red wing panel, deeper red coloration, and solid deep-black throat with no hint of gray. Female is much more distinctive, with her strawberry-red back and face. Gives a hard, metallic trill and a high, whistled “tserrri”, both which a distinctly metallic quality."
0,Sunda Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Taenioptynx sylvaticus,https://ebird.org/species/colowl3,"A tiny brown owl of humid forest in mountains and foothills, with brown upperparts and white underparts with long, broad rufous-brown streaks. Tooting song is variable, though the most common pattern is “doot doot-doot doot do-do-do,” repeated every 10-30 seconds. Often sings during the day, and can be mistaken for a barbet, but the exact pattern of toots is unlike any barbet. Visually, could be mistaken for a scops-owl, but separated by the distinctive voice, the broad brown streaks below, and the lack of ear tufts."
0,Sunda Pygmy Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Yungipicus moluccensis,https://ebird.org/species/bncwoo2,"Small plain woodpecker of wooded areas from primary rainforest to parklands and forest edges. Brownish overall with a white-striped head, a spotted back, and pale gray streaks on a buffy breast. Male has a small red speck near the back of the crown. Similar Gray-capped Woodpecker is black-and-white, with a less cleanly striped head, cleaner underparts, and unevenly distributed pale spotting on the back and wings. Sunda’s call is a high-pitched rattling trill."
0,Sunda Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myiomela diana,https://ebird.org/species/sunrob1,"Medium-sized robin of montane and foothill forests in Java and Sumatra. Male is dark blue, with a bright white spot on the forehead. Female is warm earthy cinnamon-brown, with a grayish belly. Dark belly and male’s white forehead (instead of eyebrow) serve to distinguish this species from blue robins and shortwings. Shy and furtive, typically moving about quietly on or close to the ground, often in pairs. Song consists of a short series of beautiful musical, fluty notes; rising in Sumatran birds, generally descending in Javan birds."
0,Sunda Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus lempiji,https://ebird.org/species/susowl2,"Small brown owl with large dark eyes and small, soft-looking ear tufts. Dark brown, almost black, eyes separate it from otherwise similar species such as Mountain, Oriental, and Rajah scops-owls. Reddish Scops-Owl is also dark-eyed, but it is darker-faced and tinged with rufous overall. Like most other small scops-owls, Sunda is more readily heard than seen: it gives yelping hoots at widely-spaced intervals. Relatively tolerant of human habitation; often encountered in gardens, plantations, and parks, as well as forests."
0,Sunda Teal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas gibberifrons,https://ebird.org/species/suntea1,"Small, dull, brown duck with ruby-red eyes.

Note dull orangish head with bright white eyerings, green wings with white wing bars, and gray back. Similar in appearance to closely related Yellow-breasted Warbler, but underparts are white. Forages actively in lower and middle levels of forest, often associating with mixed flocks. Song is a series of piercing high-pitched whistles. Calls include a dry “tchit” and a dry descending rattle."
0,Sungrebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Heliornithidae,Heliornis fulica,https://ebird.org/species/sungre1,"Retiring, small swimming bird of tropical lowlands. It’s not a grebe and it doesn’t like the sun; instead it favors slow-moving shady streams, mangroves, quiet ponds, and lake edges. Swims with a slight head-jerking motion and flies off low over the water when disturbed or climbs up into low branches and tangles; does not dive. The striped head and neck and stout pointed bill are distinctive. The cheeks are white on the male and orangish on the female."
0,Sunset Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Trichoglossus forsteni,https://ebird.org/species/railor3,"A fairly large long-tailed parrot with unmistakable striking coloration. Green with a dark purple head, a red bill, a lime-green collar, and a broad red chest patch above deep purple underparts. Juveniles duller, with a brownish bill.

Its tail is usually blue (except juveniles, which have brown tails). Breeding males have a pale blue crown, cheek, and back with a strong black line from the bill through the eyes and around the back of the head. Nonbreeding males are fairly plain grayish-brown birds with black bills and bright blue tails. Females have a duller blue tail and a reddish bill. Note that the patch between the eye and bill (lores) on females is a reddish color of about the same tone as the bill (in Variegated Fairywren the lores are much darker than the bill). Female Superb Fairywrens have a much cooler-grayer plumage than the warm tones of Red-backed Fairywren. This species is abundant in parks, gardens, and open woodlands around much of southeastern Australia."
0,Superb Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus superbus,https://ebird.org/species/sufdov1,"Tiny rainforest dove with white belly and white vent (compared to Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove which has a yellow belly and vent). Males have a thick black chest band and purple crown. Occurs in eastern Indonesia, New Guinea, and down the east coast of Australia (where it is more common in the north). Voice is often a short sequence of repeated hoots that don’t accelerate to the same extent as Rose-crowned Fruit-Dove."
0,Superb Lyrebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Menuridae,Menura novaehollandiae,https://ebird.org/species/suplyr1,"Large ground-dwelling bird with powerful legs and long tail. Primarily gray-brown with reddish outer wing. Males have spectacular long tail comprising different feather types. The main “lyre” feathers bold barring while the other feathers are plain, thin, and wispy. Juveniles and females lack the longer tail feathers. This may cause confusion with Albert’s Lyrebird, but note range and color of underparts (cold and grayish in Superb). Superb Lyrebird is found in rainforest habitats in southeastern Australia, where it forages in leaf litter for food. It has a very powerful song and is known for mimicking other species."
0,Superb Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Polytelis swainsonii,https://ebird.org/species/suppar1,"Large, elegant green parrot with long pointed tail, found in inland New South Wales region.

Similar to Hildebrandt’s and Shelley’s Starlings, but easily separated by the white breast band. The calls include a variety of scolds and squeals."
0,Superb Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris superbus,https://ebird.org/species/supsun2,"A large, long-billed sunbird in which males and females are very different. Males are dark, with iridescent green upperparts, a bluish-purple throat and breast, and a blood-red belly. Females have olive-brown upperparts, mostly yellowish underparts, an orangish undertail, and a prominent pale eye-stripe. Found in rainforest, gallery forest, and adjacent lush savanna, mostly in the canopy. Similar to Johanna’s Sunbird, but larger; male is separated by the bluish-purple throat and breast and female by the unstriped underparts. One common call is distinctive and unusual for a sunbird, sounding more like a puffback: a nasal “kyyep.” The song is a few staccato clear notes, sometimes followed by a fast jumble."
0,Superciliaried Hemispingus,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Thlypopsis superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/suphem1,"A small warbler-like tanager with significant variation across its range. Most birds are olive above and yellow below with a gray crown and obvious white eyebrow. Birds in northern and central Peru are gray above and whitish below, still with an obvious white eyebrow. Birds in western Venezuela have a yellow eyebrow. Compare with Drab Hemispingus, which is duller olive with a less obvious eyebrow, and with Citrine Warbler (especially in Venezuela, where the hemispingus also has a yellow eyebrow). Note Citrine Warbler’s wider eyebrow and paler legs. The hemispingus is usually found in pairs or small groups that forage actively in the canopy of forest or edge, often following mixed-species flocks. Occurs from around 2,200m up to treeline."
0,Superciliated Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cantorchilus superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/supwre1,"This brown-and-white wren has an amazingly loud voice for its size. It inhabits dry forest and scrub in western Ecuador and northwestern Peru.

0,Swamp Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Muscicapa aquatica,https://ebird.org/species/swafly3,"Chunky brown flycatcher with a white throat and brown chest band. Birds in the eastern part of the range show a lot of contrast on the underparts, while western birds are duller. Found in habitats adjacent to water, including papyrus swamp, marsh, riverbanks, and lakeshores. Not very vocal, but the quiet song is a mix of rasps, trills, and high-pitched whistles. Duller western birds can be confused with Cassin’s Flycatcher, which is also often found near water, but are brown rather than gray overall."
0,Swamp Francolin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Ortygornis gularis,https://ebird.org/species/swafra1,"Brown francolin with an orange throat and white-striped underparts.

Gathers in large flocks during migration and on its wintering grounds, sometimes mixed with other waterfowl. The bicolored head and neck, dark brown above and tan below, and long dark bill distinguish this species from other geese in its range. Domestic forms (sometimes called “Chinese geese”) vary in plumage from all white to mottled to brown; most have a large bulb above the bill that is not found on wild birds and have stockier bodies and necks."
0,Swee Waxbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Coccopygia melanotis,https://ebird.org/species/swewax3,"A tiny, colorful seed-eating waxbill with grayish underparts, an olive-green back, and a scarlet rump and upper tail. The male has a black throat patch which the female lacks. The Angolan population has a finely barred back and wings and is considered a different species by some authorities. Pairs and small groups eat grass and small insects in open areas adjacent to forest, thickets, and garden cover. The species is often detected by its simple soft, plaintive “swee-swee” and “seeet” calls. The Yellow-bellied Waxbill strongly resembles the Swee Waxbill, but its belly is washed buff, the male lacks a black throat, and their ranges do not overlap."
0,Swift Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Lathamus discolor,https://ebird.org/species/swipar1,"Colorful migratory parrot with long red pointed tail. Breeds in Tasmania and migrates to southeastern Australia in autumn and winter. Found in a wide variety of forests, where its presence is largely dictated by flowering eucalypts on which it feeds.

Call is a wailing grunt, given in a rhythmic series, sometimes for extended periods with short breaks; it is unlike any other bird vocalization in this species’s limited range."
0,Tepui Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo sclateri,https://ebird.org/species/tepgre1,"Small, arboreal bird of tepui highlands. Olive-gray above and yellowish below, with a gray head, pinkish bill, and pale eye. One of the most widespread tepui endemics, it occurs in both tall and stunted forest on tepui slopes and on isolated formations at elevations as low as 500 meters. Forages actively, searching foliage for insects and often joining mixed-species flocks. Usually heard before it is seen. Song is a distinctive two-parted whistle, with varying degrees of inflection, the second note lower-pitched. Also gives harsh scold notes like other vireos. Most similar to Lemon-chested Greenlet but has very different voice and occurs at higher elevations."
0,Tepui Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Troglodytes rufulus,https://ebird.org/species/tepwre1,"Small, rufous-brown bird of tepui undergrowth. Readily identified by small size, rufous-brown plumage, buffy eyebrow, and (at close range) black barring on wings and tail. Occurs in mossy forest understory and stunted forest at middle and high elevations of the tepui region. Usually remains in dense cover and can be difficult to see, but it will sing from exposed perches. Found in pairs, which forage for insects on and near the ground and typically do not join mixed-species flocks. Song is a high, metallic pair of notes slurred together, the second note lower-pitched, repeated at length and sometimes extended into a tinkling, jumbled series. Calls are harsh scolds reminiscent of other wrens. Distinguished from Flutist Wren (only other wren in range) by strongly rufous coloration and buffy eyebrow."
0,Terek Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Xenus cinereus,https://ebird.org/species/tersan,"Unique smallish wader with stumpy bright orange legs and a noticeably upturned bill. Plumage gray overall with white belly, but in flight shows conspicuous white trailing edge to wings. Breeds in valley floodplains in tundra and taiga. In the non-breeding season, occurs singly or in flocks in varied wetland habitats, from fresh marshes to tidal mudflats, and often apart from other shorebirds. Feeds by dashing after insects and also by probing bill in mud, like a mini-godwit."
0,Terrestrial Brownbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Phyllastrephus terrestris,https://ebird.org/species/terbro1,"A dull, dark brown, gregarious understory brownbul with dark red eyes and a whitish throat. Small groups of 4-6 individuals skulk in thickets and in lowland and montane forest up to 2100 meters. They hop and sneak through the undergrowth, flicking dead leaves and looking for insects and small vertebrates, giving a series of harsh nasal “ugk-ugk-ugk-ugk” chuckling notes that draw attention to themselves. The similar Northern Brownbul differs from the Terrestrial Brownbul by having warmer reddish tones on the tail and rump, and by lacking a white throat."
0,Tessmann's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Fraseria tessmanni,https://ebird.org/species/tesfly1,"A plain, strong-billed rainforest flycatcher that is dark gray and black on the upperparts and pale below. Sometimes shows a vague darker gray band across the breast. Scarce and local in rainforest clearings, secondary forest, overgrown plantations, and forest edge, mostly at the middle levels. Most similar to Dusky-blue Flycatcher, but has much paler underparts. Also similar to Cassin’s Flycatcher, but has paler underparts, and not strongly associated with water. Similar in coloration to Little Gray Flycatcher, but much larger and paler below. The song is pretty and thrush-like: a mixture of whistles and trills given at a conversational rhythm."
0,Thamnornis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Bernieridae,Thamnornis chloropetoides,https://ebird.org/species/thamno2,"Odd, warbler-like, long-tailed and long-billed tetraka. Madagascar endemic that is the only tetraka regularly found in spiny forest. Mostly skulks in the understory, but will sing from an open perch at the top of a tree. Song is a sputtering trill that is sometimes followed by a series of lower “chup” notes. Larger, longer-tailed, and longer-billed than jeries. More greenish than Subdesert Brush Warbler, with white tips to the tail, and without fuzzy breast streaks."
0,Thekla's Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Galerida theklae,https://ebird.org/species/thelar1,"Very like Crested Lark, with which it often occurs. Best told by bill shape, which is shorter and stubbier, with a convex lower mandible. Crest is also shorter and more fanlike; rump is more contrasting and rusty-tinged. Breast streaks heavier and more contrasting than Crested Lark. Found in stony and sandy areas with scattered bushes in Iberia, North Africa and East Africa. More likely to perch up on bushes than Crested Lark."
0,Thicket Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Myrmothera dives,https://ebird.org/species/thiant1,"Secretive and very difficult to see. Distinctive antpitta shape: very plump with hardly any tail, very long sturdy legs. Distinguished from other antpittas by rich rufous flanks with darker streaking on breast. Hops on the ground in dense forest, edges, and tangles; sometimes perches off the ground to sing (but still always concealed). Much more easily heard than seen; listen for its fast rising series of whistles."
0,Thicket Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Crypturellus cinnamomeus,https://ebird.org/species/thitin1,"A furtive, ‘tail-less’ gamebird that lives on the ground in tropical woodland and forest. Rarely seen (sometimes crosses quiet roads or trails), but haunting whistled song is often heard, especially early and late in the day. Note distinct pale barring on upperparts and bright reddish legs. Birds in West Mexico are paler and grayer overall, those in East Mexico and Central America have a rusty-colored breast and belly."
0,Thrush Nightingale,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Luscinia luscinia,https://ebird.org/species/thrnig1,"Very similar to Common Nightingale, but more dusky brown (not reddish-brown) with a mottled brown breast (not plain and sandy). Their songs can be confusingly similar, but the Thrush Nightingale is more monotonous, less varied, and slower, resembling that of Song Thrush. Found in thick, damp, deciduous forest as well as well-wooded parks and gardens. Feeds on invertebrates and berries."
0,Tibetan Babax,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Pterorhinus koslowi,https://ebird.org/species/tibbab1,"A russet-brown babbler with pale eyes and a slightly curved black bill. Endemic to the eastern end of the Tibetan Plateau, where it inhabits areas with scrubby bushes and stunted trees. Generally, not as often seen around habitation as the larger, grayer Giant Babax (no range overlap), but will sometimes be seen taking handouts at monasteries. Forages on the ground, usually in pairs or small flocks."
0,Tibetan Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus maximus,https://ebird.org/species/tibbla1,"Dark and robust inhabitant of open subalpine areas with sparse vegetation, such as shrubby slopes, gardens, and plantations. Seldom seen in dense forests. Adult males are inky black with a bright orange bill and no eyering. Females look similar, but are dark brown instead of black with a dark orange bill. Very similar to Indian and Chinese Blackbirds, but Tibetan Blackbirds are larger and more uniformly dark than either Indian or Chinese Blackbirds."
0,Tibetan Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza koslowi,https://ebird.org/species/tibbun1,"Handsome thickset bunting restricted to a small part of the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau where it inhabits scrubby slopes above the timberline. Unmistakable in its range; no other bunting in the area combines its size, brick-orange back, and gray belly. Male has a striking black-and-white head pattern while female is gray-headed with weak streaking. Song is an unmusical and unremarkable series of high, sharp “pi-pi-pipipew” notes."

Typically at 3000-5000 meters, though it is known to descend in the winter. Regularly found around monasteries which put food out for wildlife. Forages on the ground in small to medium-sized flocks. Can be vocal, giving high-pitched grunts and a rising squeal: “gu-tse-WEEW!"""
0,Tibetan Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Melanocorypha maxima,https://ebird.org/species/tiblar1,"Huge bulky lark with a sharp, slightly decurved bill. Pale brown above and off-white below, with a pale brow stripe, distinct brownish ear patch, and a black mark on the neck near the shoulder. Has a less contrasting head pattern than Calandra Lark and Bimaculated Lark, but is overall more strongly patterned than female Black Lark. Distinctively blade-like bill also distinguishes this species from the former two. In flight, snowy white tail edges and back wing edges are eye-catchingly prominent; Calandra Lark has minimal white on the tail tips, and Bimaculated Lark lacks white on either wings or tail. Found in high plateau regions, where it prefers rather wet areas, often on the margins of lakes, marshes, and flooded pastures. Song, given in flight, includes rolling warbles and buzzy grating notes. Calls resemble harsh, buzzy phrases from song."

Male has short but prominent black mustache and a dark bill. Female lacks the mustache, but has an orange bill and a pale white eyebrow stripe faintly resembling that of female and immature House Sparrows. Flashing white wing patches are only prominent when in flight. Confusingly, the Black-winged Snowfinch (Montifringilla adamsi) is occasionally referred to as the Tibetan Snowfinch in older field guides."
0,Tickell's Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis tickelliae,https://ebird.org/species/tibfly3,"Attractive medium-sized flycatcher with blue upperparts and orange-and-white underparts, with the most orange on the chest and the throat. Male is more intensely-colored overall than the female. Smaller-billed profile, less extensive orange, and paler face distinguish this species from male Hill Blue Flycatcher. Extensive orange on the throat separates Tickell’s from Blue-throated Flycatcher. Favors open hill forests as well as forest edge, particularly in drier, scrubby areas, often close to water. Both sexes give a pleasant high-pitched tinkling song. Calls include dry rattles and metallic clinks."
0,Tickell's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus affinis,https://ebird.org/species/tilwar1,"Brown-and-yellow leaf warbler without a wingbar. Breeds in stony shrubbery, primarily in the high Himalayas and the Trans-Himalaya. Winters throughout the Indian Subcontinent south of the Himalayas, but is most abundant in shrubbery in the northeast Indian plains and in the high Western Ghats. Resembles Sulphur-bellied Warbler, but has a yellower cheek and underparts, and shows little contrast between the eyebrow and the throat. Tickell’s spends less time on or near the ground than Sulphur-bellied, tends to flock, and often participates in mixed-species foraging flocks."
0,Tickell's Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/ticthr1,"Both sexes of this thrush are fairly uniformly-colored: the male is predominantly blue-gray and the female is warm brown with a slight buffy wash to the underparts. May be confused with Indian Blackbird in southwestern wintering range, but both sexes are paler and smaller than their respective counterparts of that species. Breeds in open forest and forest edge in hilly and submontane areas; winters in similar habitat at lower altitudes. Sings melodic warbling and buzzing phrases; also gives a short bubbly bursts of “chup” notes."
0,Ticking Doradito,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Pseudocolopteryx citreola,https://ebird.org/species/ticdor1,"Very local little bird of fresh and brackish marshes and adjacent weedy vegetation in lowlands. Departs Chile in the winter (mainly late March to mid-October) for unknown areas east of the Andes. Usually inconspicuous, hopping low in bushes and weeds, but sings from atop a bush or tall rush stalk. Distinctive in Chilean range: underparts are bright yellow, upperparts plain olive-brown with paler wingbars and soft rusty cap. Similar species occur east of the Andes."

A rather uncommon resident of tall rainforest; usually found in pairs or small groups, which can be quite noisy and often perch on exposed bare branches. Feeds mainly on insects gleaned in short flights to foliage. May follow mixed-species flocks but often observed away from them. Most easily detected by its varied, strident calls, which include a long, mournful whistle reminiscent of Dusky-capped Flycatcher, and a rapid series of short whistles, the final one lower-pitched and longer. Distinguished from Dusky-capped Flycatcher by white underparts and more varied, excited-sounding vocalizations."
0,Tody Motmot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Momotidae,Hylomanes momotula,https://ebird.org/species/todmot1,"Small and infrequently seen bird of shady forest understory in humid tropical lowlands. Rather inactive. Sits quietly, mainly at low to middle levels, and occasionally wags its tail slowly. Usually not seen until flushed, when flies off with a low whirr of wings. Note the overall drab greenish plumage with a rusty cap and bushy whitish whisker marks. Much smaller than other motmots and lacks the racket tail tips of most larger motmot species."
0,Togian Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox burhani,https://ebird.org/species/toghao1,"A medium-sized brown owl with piercing yellow eyes, confined to the Togian Islands. Cryptically patterned, with a mottled breast, an unmarked pale lower belly, indistinct white eyebrows, and widely scattered white markings on wings. Pairs inhabit forests of lowlands and hills, also occurring in slightly modified habitats. Migrant Northern Boobook visits these islands too; Togian Boobook differs in its finer markings below, pale belly, widespread white markings on wings, and understated white eyebrows. Frog-like vocalizations are unlike those of any owl in region: a grating, but explosive “grrrrr-wow-waow.”"
0,Togo Paradise-Whydah,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Vidua togoensis,https://ebird.org/species/topwhy1,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Yellow-winged Pytilias. As with other whydahs, breeding males are spectacular and bizarre, whereas non-breeding males and females are drab and inconspicuous. Breeding males are mostly black with a rufous breast, a yellow back of the neck, and a long, narrow tail. Non-breeding male and female plumages are poorly known, but show a streaky brownish back and pale underparts. Generally scarce and local in savanna and cultivated areas. Breeding male similar to other paradise-whydahs, but has a longer and narrower tail. Separation of non-breeding male and female from other paradise-whydahs is poorly understood. Not very vocal, but does mimic Yellow-winged Pytilia vocalizations, which include simple, nasal “teew” notes."
0,Tolima Blossomcrown,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Anthocephala berlepschi,https://ebird.org/species/tolblo1,"Small hummingbird mostly confined to Colombia’s central Andes, also reaching the eastern Andes in the southern part of the country. Both sexes have a large, white teardrop behind the eye and pale tips to the tail. Male has a chestnut crown that becomes white where it reaches the bill. Inhabits cloud forest and feeds on small flowers at low levels. Sometimes gives a series of soft chips while perched."

0,Tolima Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Leptotila conoveri,https://ebird.org/species/toldov1,"Shy dove found only in Andean cloud forest in central Colombia. The dull reddish-purple color on neck and breast, gray crown, and pale eye separate it from the much more common and widespread White-tipped Dove. Usually stays well hidden, but sometimes comes out into the open in clearings and along quiet roads, especially early in the morning. Gives low, well-spaced coos."
0,Tomtit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Petroica macrocephala,https://ebird.org/species/tomtit1,"Small forest bird with distinct large head and short tail, endemic to New Zealand. The five subspecies are restricted to North, South, Snares, Auckland, and Chatham Islands, respectively. Plumage is variable depending on sex and location. Males are generally black and white, females brown and white. Both sexes have a white spot at the base of the bill, which is raised as a threat display. Favors mature native forests, but also uses scrub and exotic forest stands. Feeds in understory of forest but will come out in the open. Perches on trunks and branches before swooping down to take insect prey. Listen for musical male song “ti-oly-oly-oly-ho,” often likened to a squeaky gate being opened and shut."
0,Tongan Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala jacquinoti,https://ebird.org/species/tonwhi1,"Male striking, with bright golden underparts and neck, olive wings, and a deep black head, chest, and tail. Female mostly olive-yellow with a grayish cap and a pale throat. Found in primary and sometimes secondary forest, but generally avoids villages and gardens. Song consists of a complex mix of whistles ending in a loud, far-carrying whipcrack."
0,Topknot Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Lopholaimus antarcticus,https://ebird.org/species/toppig1,"A large solid pigeon with a unique waved crest on the back of the head. Almost entirely gray with darker wing feathers. Tail is dark gray with a broad pale band. Typically seen feeding on fruit high in rainforest canopy trees. Also, often observed flying in large flocks at high altitudes over other habitats – look for the banded tail in flight."
0,Toro Olive-Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Phyllastrephus hypochloris,https://ebird.org/species/toogre1,"A drab, long-tailed brownish greenbul. The upperparts are brown and the underparts paler olive-gray. Also note the long bill, brown eye, and slightly paler throat. Found in forest at low and middle elevations, preferring the understory and middle levels of the forest. Separation from other greenbuls is tricky. Very similar to Cabanis’s Greenbul, but lacks pale eye-ring and has darker underparts. More robust and longer-billed than other similarly dull greenbuls, such as Little Greenbul, with a slightly more contrastingly pale throat. The inconspicuous song is a series of low-pitched whistles, often followed by a descending series of several rasping calls. Also gives a series of scolding calls on an even pitch."

Color varies from gray to brown, and occasionally to rufous. Inhabits dry forest, including spiny forest, scrub, and plantations. Often found on day roosts in low tree holes or tangles. Song is a rolling “trrr-trrr-trrr…”. Very similar to Malagasy Scops-Owl, but found in dry forest rather than rainforest, and its song consists of notes that are rolled together rather than distinct hooting notes."
0,Torrent Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Merganetta armata,https://ebird.org/species/torduc1,"An amazing duck of fast-flowing Andean rivers and streams. Usually seen as singles or pairs resting on rocks in rushing water and not associating with other ducks. Feeds by diving in churning water and pools and is somehow able to swim up-current with no apparent exertion. Sexes look quite different, but both have a bright red bill and striped back; male has a white head with black lines, while female has a gray head and bright rusty underparts. Body pattern of male varies regionally from black overall to striped with whitish or rusty."
0,Torrent Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Serpophaga cinerea,https://ebird.org/species/tortyr1,"Unique small gray flycatcher found exclusively along fast-moving rivers and streams. Often perches on rocks in the middle of a waterway, but also along the edge. Plumage is also unlike any other flycatcher; pale gray overall with diffuse black cap and black wings and tail. Sexes similar. Pumps tail."
0,Torresian Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus orru,https://ebird.org/species/torcro2,"Australian crows and ravens are challenging to identify; concentrate on call, throat-hackles, behavior, and location. Calls include fairly short, repeated “ah-ah-ah” and a unique rattling croaking. Throat hackles can look impressive, leading to confusion with ravens. Inhabits many habitats in northern two-thirds of Australia and in New Guinea. The default crow/raven of Darwin, Cairns, and Brisbane."

0,Townsend's Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates socorroensis,https://ebird.org/species/leastp5,"Endangered seabird found in the Pacific Ocean well off the coast of Mexico and southern California. It breeds in summer on small islets near Guadalupe Island, located 160 miles from Baja California, and disperses northward and southward at other times of the year. Plumage is dark gray with a notched tail and pale stripes on the upperwing; rump may be either dark or white. Flies erratically and often patters the ocean with its feet. Very similar to Leach’s Storm-Petrel, which also has white- and dark-rumped forms, but it is smaller and darker with more rounded wings and less contrasting wing stripe. Also very similar to Ainley's Storm-Petrel, but keep in mind that Ainley’s has not yet been recorded in US waters."
0,Townsend's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga townsendi,https://ebird.org/species/towwar,"Brightly-colored warbler with a contrasting face pattern with dark cheeks and crown surrounded by bright yellow.

Intensity of color varies with age and sex; adult males are brightest, with black throat, while immatures are more washed out with a pale yellowish throat. Breeds in mature coniferous forests in northwestern North America. Winters from the Pacific coast of the U.S. to Costa Rica, with large numbers especially in the highlands of Mexico and Guatemala. Usually stays in the canopy. Sometimes gathers in large mixed flocks with other warblers and small songbirds, especially on the wintering grounds. Compare with plainer-faced Hermit Warbler, and beware that hybrids occur. Also similar to Black-throated Green Warbler, which overlaps in range most often on the wintering grounds; note Townsend’s darker cheeks and more extensive yellow on breast."
0,Tractrac Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Emarginata tractrac,https://ebird.org/species/tracha1,"A small, dumpy endearing chat. The color varies from pale gray-brown to nearly white, with a very pale rump that extends onto the outer tail feathers to form a distinctive V-shaped black wedge in the tail. Pairs prefer open flat plains in the Karoo and Namib, prospering in the most barren environments where few other birds persist. In Namibia, the similar race of Karoo Chat is longer-tailed, avoids hyper-arid barren environments, and has a distinctive dark tail with white outer tail feathers that reach the tail tip."
0,Transvolcanic Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma ultramarina,https://ebird.org/species/mexjay3,"Rather large, blue-and-gray jay of highland pine and pine-oak forest endemic to highlands of central Mexico; occurs in transvolcanic belt from Volcánes de Colima in the west to Volcán Orizaba in the east. Typically travels in wide-ranging flocks of 5–25 birds, mainly at middle to upper levels in trees. Appreciably larger and broader-winged than Woodhouse's Scrub-Jays, with plainer plumage (lacks dark mask, whitish eyebrow, and partial dark collar of Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay). Noisy calls carry well."
0,Tree Martin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Petrochelidon nigricans,https://ebird.org/species/tremar2,"Small swallow dark above, pale below, with grayish rump and notched tail. Call is a pleasant twittering, unlike harsh call of Fairy Martin, which has paler rump and rusty crown. Found throughout Australia in many habitats, including urban areas."
0,Tree Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus trivialis,https://ebird.org/species/trepip,"Slender and streaked pipit. Feeds on the ground like other pipits, but perches readily in trees or bushes when singing, or alights in tree at end of parachuting song flight. As the name suggests, usually associated with trees (on breeding grounds), but also found in agricultural areas and grassy scrub in winter. All pipits look rather similar and are best identified to species by combination of habitat and voice: Tree Pipit call a high, shrill, buzzy ""tzzz""; song more melodic and varied than Meadow Pipit song."
0,Tree Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Tachycineta bicolor,https://ebird.org/species/treswa,"Common and widespread throughout most of North America, breeding as far north as Alaska and wintering to Panama. A medium-sized swallow, with gleaming white underparts. Adult males are bright iridescent blue-green above; females and immatures are duller brownish with limited or no iridescence. Always note compact shape, fairly broad wings, and slightly notched tail. Occurs in a variety of open habitats including grassy fields, lakes, and marshes. Often in flocks, sometimes mixed with other species of swallows. Breeds in cavities, including human-made nest boxes. Listen for cheery gurgling calls. Compare especially with Violet-green Swallow; note Tree Swallow does not show extensive white wrapping around the cheek or the sides of the rump."
0,Tricolored Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Agelaius tricolor,https://ebird.org/species/tribla,"Very similar to Red-winged Blackbird. Male entirely glossy black with red shoulder patch bordered by white, not yellow. Female dark brown and streaky, larger and darker than any sparrow. Lacks warm tones to plumage, unlike female Red-winged Blackbird. For both sexes, note relatively thin, sharp bill. Found in marshes and adjacent fields; breeds in colonies. Undergoing significant population decline due to habitat loss. Song is nasal and low-pitched, not as complex or as musical as Red-winged."
0,Tricolored Brushfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Atlapetes tricolor,https://ebird.org/species/trbfin1,"This chunky bird is dingy yellow below and dark brownish above with a yellow or tawny crown. Sexes similar. Could be confused with Yellow-breasted Brushfinch, which is found at higher elevations and has a brighter rufous crown.

Slaty-blue overall with a white belly and white underwings. Extremely long bill. In breeding plumage, look for buffy plumes on the lower back and orange tones on the throat and foreneck. Juveniles are stained rusty on the neck and shoulders. Fairly common but with restricted range in the southeastern U.S., mainly along the coast. More widespread in Central America and northern South America. Occurs in shallow wetlands, marshes, and mudflats. Often forages actively, darting around erratically and chasing after fish."
0,Tricolored Parrotfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Erythrura tricolor,https://ebird.org/species/tripar1,"A small blue finch with conspicuous red tail and an emerald-green back. Females duller, with green extending to nape. Juveniles dull green, with gray head and pale bill, but still show red tail. Singles, pairs, or flocks feed on or near the ground in forests, open woodlands, and thickets within the lowlands and mountains. An undescribed parrotfinch has been documented on Mount Mutis in Timor; Tricolored differs from it in lacking red on the face. Calls include soft, high-pitched “seet” and “sit” notes."
0,Trilling Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola woosnami,https://ebird.org/species/tricis1,"Fairly large, plain cisticola. Note the rufous cap, pale underparts, and two bands across the tip of the tail, one pale and one black. Found in a variety of savanna habitats, including miombo. The distinctive song is a high, rising trill, given from a prominent perch. The call is an agitated, repeated “chit.” As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification. Fairly similar to Whistling Cisticola, but has a rufous cap."
0,Trilling Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus parvirostris,https://ebird.org/species/tritap1,"Tiny, compact gray bird. Females are slightly duller, with brown lower sides and rump. Like most tapaculos, they are usually very shy and rarely seen in the open. Nearly identical to Tschudi’s Tapaculo, which is found at higher elevations where the two overlap; their songs are also very different. Trilling Tapaculo’s song is a long, rapid chatter."

0,Trinidad Motmot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Momotidae,Momotus bahamensis,https://ebird.org/species/trimot1,"Fantastic bird with a long, racket-tipped tail found only in Trinidad and Tobago, where it is the only motmot. No other bird in the country shares its beautiful orange, green, and blue color pattern, and the black mask, breast spot, ruby eye, and large size make it truly unforgettable. Inhabits rainforest where it stays fairly low and usually well hidden, but occasionally may venture out into more open areas if there are large trees to perch in. Often gives a low-pitched “boo” or “boo-dip”, and sometimes a longer series when excited."
0,Trinidad Piping-Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pipile pipile,https://ebird.org/species/trpgua1,"Large, turkey-like bird found only in the forests of northern Trinidad. It is black with white patches on the wings and crown, a light blue face, and an azure dewlap (flap of bare skin) that dangles from its throat. It is usually seen high in the trees, but on rare occasions can descend to the ground. Song is a series of drawn out, rising whistles, and it also sometimes rattles its wings loudly in flight. Locally known as “pawi”, this impressive bird is highly endangered due to hunting, and is regularly seen in only a few places, such as near the town of Grand Riviere."
0,Tristan Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus eremita,https://ebird.org/species/trithr1,"A robust, variably plumaged dark thrush with orange and buff markings and blotchy brown streaks. Juvenile has buff fringes to its feathers. The only medium-sized songbird within its range. Singles and pairs are fairly common endemic residents on islands within the Tristan group in the south Atlantic, but rare on Tristan da Cunha itself due to introduced rats. A generalist predator and scavenger occupying heath, tussock grassland, and shorelines. Gives a short high-pitched chipping “ttslit” and a simple wheezy song."
0,Tristram's Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Emberizidae,Emberiza tristrami,https://ebird.org/species/tribun1,"Small and distinctive bunting, usually seen moving around quietly in thick undergrowth. Warm rusty brown with a black-and-white striped head.

0,Tropical Kingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus melancholicus,https://ebird.org/species/trokin,"Large, ubiquitous yellow-bellied flycatcher found throughout most of Middle and South America, though tends to be uncommon at the far northern end of its range in the U.S. A classic “telephone wire” bird along roadsides and in towns. Prefers open areas with some trees and water. Most abundant in lowlands and foothills, but ventures up to over 3,000m in some parts of range. Listen for sharp, high-pitched twitters. Nearly identical to Couch’s Kingbird, which overlaps from Texas to Belize; best separated by voice. Larger and longer-billed than Western and Cassin’s Kingbird; also note paler brownish tail. Also very similar to White-throated (longer, forked tail) and Snowy-throated (dark mask) Kingbirds in some parts of South America."
0,Tropical Mockingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mimidae,Mimus gilvus,https://ebird.org/species/tromoc,"Tropical counterpart to Northern Mockingbird of North America. Common and often conspicuous in open and semi-open lowland tropical areas, perching on roadside wires and bare snags. Silvery gray above and whitish below with a long rounded tail that is black with a bold white tip. Lacks the big white wing patches of Northern Mockingbird, and the ranges of the two species do not really overlap. Varied calls and loud mimic song is much like Northern Mockingbird."

0,Tropical Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus cinereus,https://ebird.org/species/tropew1,"Small ‘generic’ flycatcher of forest edge and open woodland in tropical lowlands. Behavior is much like that of the wood-pewees in North America: usually perches on a fairly prominent and conspicuous twig or branch and sallies out for insects, returning to the same perch, often calling as it lands, and sometimes ‘shivering’ its tail. Does not flick its wings and tail like flycatchers in the genus Empidonax. Eastern and Western Wood-Pewees occur as spring and fall migrants in the range of Tropical, but have longer wings that extend farther down the tail on a perched bird, and different calls."
0,Tropical Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops choliba,https://ebird.org/species/trsowl,"As with all screech-owls, much easier to identify by voice: a short rapid trill with a pop at the end. If you’re lucky enough to see one, look for an overall grayish-brown or rufous bird with fine markings, including thin streaks on underparts. Black border to face. Sexes alike. Found in wooded habitats, sometimes coming out into open shrubby fields or gardens with only a few scattered trees. Usually the most common screech-owl in range."

It is variably barred above and below. These “undulations” vary in intensity among subspecies. Like other tinamous, shy and difficult to see. Found in both wet and dry forests, preferring areas near rivers, but most often seen crossing roads or trails. Easily recognized by its voice, a far-carrying melancholic “whoo-who-whooo” repeated for long periods mostly in the early mornings and late afternoon."
0,Unicolored Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/uniant1,"Uncommon small, short-tailed antwren of the lower and middle levels of humid forests. Very active and often follows mixed-species flocks. Males are uniform gray with a small dark throat patch, while females are uniformly brown-gray, with less gray in the head than female Salvadori’s Antwrens."
0,Unicolored Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Agelasticus cyanopus,https://ebird.org/species/unibla2,"Medium-sized blackbird with a long, thin bill that is found in marshes and reedbeds. Males are all black, whereas females are highly variable across their range. Northern females from Amapá, Pará, Maranhão, and French Guiana are mostly black with an olive belly. Those from southeast Brazil are dark brownish olive above and dark yellow below. Those from central-southern South America are brown above with black streaks, a faint yellow eyebrow, and yellow underparts. The song is a rattle followed by a series of trills."
0,Unicolored Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/unijay1,"Well-named, this uniformly deep-blue jay occurs locally in highland evergreen and pine-evergreen forest. Like most jays, usually found in groups, often in association with mixed-species feeding flocks that include orioles, woodcreepers, and other jay species. Most likely confused with southern forms of Steller’s Jay, which occur in the same areas. Steller’s has bold white face spots, darker plumage with barring on wings, and short crest (which can be held flat). Also note rather different voices."
0,Unicolored Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/unitap1,"Small, gray bird found only in the western Andes of northern Peru. Adult is plain gray, lacking any black or brown barring on lower underparts. Young birds are browner and heavily scaled with gray and buff. Inhabits forest understory and heard much more often than seen. Listen for soft frog-like notes that are given alone or in a series of accelerating bursts."
0,Unicolored Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus haplochrous,https://ebird.org/species/unithr1,"Drab thrush endemic to floodplain forest of the Río Mamoré and tributaries surrounded by the flooded Moxos grasslands in El Beni, central Bolivia. From similar Hauxwell’s and Black-billed Thrushes by dull olive bill, exposed yellowish orbital skin, and relatively plain throat. Difficult to see, mainly because most of its habitat is tough to access. Song low, full whistles, 5-6 notes with little variation. Calls short full notes, or longer nasal calls."
0,Uniform Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/uniant2,"A well-named antshrike of subtropical forest understory in the Andes. Male is uniform dark gray with no distinguishing features; female almost equally nondescript, plain brown overall with contrasting gray face. Stout bill with hooked tip, like other antshrikes. Usually seen singly or in pairs in the lower levels of montane forest, rarely coming into the open. Sometimes follows mixed-species flocks. Found at higher elevations than most other antshrikes. Listen for short series of “awh” notes, accelerating slightly."
0,Uniform Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Amaurolimnas concolor,https://ebird.org/species/unicra1,"Larger than most crakes. Found in wet forests instead of marshes. Very difficult to see as it creeps through dense understory. Far more easily heard: a series of upslurred whistled notes. Look for a brown bird with richer rufous underparts, a dull greenish-yellowish bill, and reddish legs. Favors dense wet forest or thickets, often but not always near a swamp or stream."
0,Uniform Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Haplospiza unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/unifin1,Slender finch found at forest borders where it is especially associated with bamboo. Usually forages on or near the ground. Males are uniformly plain dark-gray with darker centers to wing feathers. Females are olive-brown with a streaky breast and a paler belly. The song is buzzy and high-pitched.
0,Uniform Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus vanikorensis,https://ebird.org/species/uniswi1,"A large, long-winged, entirely gray-brown swiftlet with a very shallow tail fork and a gliding flight action. Found over a variety of habitats, often in flocks with other swiftlets. Almost always seen in flight. Widespread, so overlaps with multiple similar swiftlets. Uniform Swiftlet is larger and longer-winged than Glossy, Cave, and Bornean Swiftlets, with a dark belly and a non-fluttering flight action. Uniform Swiftlet lacks the clear pale rump of White-rumped, Seram, Halmahera, Sulawesi, and some Glossy Swiftlets, and is larger than those species. Uniform lacks gloss on upperparts, unlike Mayr’s, Mountain, and Glossy Swiftlets. It is smaller than Bare-legged, Mayr’s, Papuan, Volcano, and Giant Swiftlets. It is most similar to Edible-nest and Black-nest Swiftlets, but Uniform is darker beneath, and lacks the slightly paler rump of Edible-nest; it is best distinguished from those species by its mossy nest."
0,Uniform Treehunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Thripadectes ignobilis,https://ebird.org/species/unitre1,"Medium-sized brownish bird of the lower subtropical zone in the western Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. Plain dark brown with much less streaking than other treehunters; only shows a slightly paler eyebrow and some streaking on the throat. Typically found at lower elevations than other treehunters in range, but some overlap. Western Woodhaunter is found at similar elevations but has a longer, narrower bill and a paler buffy throat. Singles or pairs follow mixed-species flocks through the understory, where they can be skulky and difficult to see. Listen for the song: a slow series of 5-10 squeaky notes."
0,Uniform Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Hylexetastes uniformis,https://ebird.org/species/uniwoo1,"Large, stout-billed woodcreeper of tall rainforest in southeastern Amazonia. Plumage entirely rufous-brown with no barring or streaking; note thick dusky-reddish bill, plain face, and brownish throat (not contrastingly white). Found in tall rainforest as well as slightly lower-stature forests on sandy soils; generally less common than other large woodcreepers. Climbs along tree trunks and large branches at middle and upper levels, probing bark crevices for insects and small vertebrates; occasionally follows army ant swarms to capture animals fleeing up tree trunks. Heard more often than seen. Song, given mainly at dawn, is a far-carrying, hoarse whistle repeated 3–4 times, very unlike other woodcreepers. Amazonian Barred-Woodcreeper, which also has a reddish bill, may occur with Uniform at ant swarms and be mistaken for it in dim understory light; note Uniform’s stouter bill and plainer plumage."
0,Upcher's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Hippolais languida,https://ebird.org/species/upcwar1,"A medium-sized, gray-brown warbler that looks very similar to other species. Note the rather stout bill and broad dark tail. Smaller and browner than Olive-Tree Warbler and larger than Eastern Olivaceous Warbler. Wing panel not as prominent as in Olive-Tree Warbler. Breeds on scrubby hillsides. During migration found in a variety of habitats. Sings from prominent perches—a repetitive, rapid mix of musical and scratchy phrases. Call is a harsh ""Chak."""
0,Upland Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus aroyae,https://ebird.org/species/uplant1,"Small antshrike found in the Andes of Bolivia and adjacent areas of Peru near the border. Male is gray with white wingbars and pale eyes; female is brown with a gray face. Male is a bit similar to Variable Antshrike, but he is gray, not glossy black. Skulks in dense thickets at forest edge, where it is usually heard before being seen. Gives nasal caws, either alone or in a short series."
0,Upland Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo hemilasius,https://ebird.org/species/uplbuz1,"A large raptor of expansive open spaces such as steppe, pastures, and semi-deserts. Perches visibly on utility poles and snags. Especially abundant near marmot and pika colonies. Longer-winged and more heavily marked than smaller Eastern and Himalayan Buzzards, but identification can be challenging. Plumages include both light and dark morphs; both have a large dark patch on the underwing at the “wrist.” Dark morph is black with pale outer underwings (“hands”), and light morph is blotchy brown below, with dark tarsal feathers (“trousers”) reminiscent of Rough-legged Hawk."
0,Upland Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Chloephaga picta,https://ebird.org/species/uplgoo1,"Common and conspicuous in most of its range, becoming uncommon and local in northern areas. Pairs and flocks are common along roadsides in Patagonian steppe grasslands, wetlands, at lakes, and along coasts. The male is strikingly white necked; some males have clean white breast and belly, others have dark-barred body. The female is brownish overall and much less noticeable with a rusty brown to grayish brown head and neck (compare to the rare Ruddy-headed Goose). Both sexes have bold black-and-white wing pattern that is striking in flight."
0,Upland Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus sylvanus,https://ebird.org/species/uplpip1,"This large pipit has an expansive range, but is uncommon and sparsely distributed throughout most of it. Breeds in foothills and mountains, but descends during the winter. Large-billed and rather thickset, with an upright stance, fine dark streaks throughout with paler underparts. Also note paler brow. May be confused with Richard’s and Blyth’s Pipits, but it is more densely streaked and with a stouter and shorter bill."
0,Upland Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Bartramia longicauda,https://ebird.org/species/uplsan,"Distinctive sandpiper found in areas with short grass. Frequently seen perched on fence posts or atop small shrubs. Overall patterned buffy-brown with small head, long neck, large eye, and yellow bill with black tip. Long tail and shallow fluttery wingbeats give it a unique look in flight. Song typically given in flight; starts with a soft gurgling trill and ends with a loud whistle that rises and falls. Migrates to South America in the winter, particularly Paraguay and northern Argentina."
0,Ural Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix uralensis,https://ebird.org/species/uraowl1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common in colder regions, where favors coniferous and mixed forest, often with nearby clearings and bogs. Active at night, when often hunts at forest edge and around clearings. Very large and rather plain owl with small dark eyes, no ear tufts; lacks any obvious field marks, and often looks somewhat pallid and grayish. Large and longer-tailed than Tawny Owl, which occurs mainly in milder and more southern habitats; also Great Gray Owl."
0,Urich's Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phyllomyias urichi,https://ebird.org/species/urityr1,"Poorly known, this small, yellow-green flycatcher is short-billed and long-tailed, with a pinkish lower mandible, whitish lores, and yellowish wingbars. Olive green above and yellow below. Sexes similar. Rare and nearly unknown in life; no certainty about the habitat, but presumably in forested areas. Vocalizations unknown. Similar to Sooty-headed Tyrannulet which has a black bill, lacks wingbars, and has a contrasting grayish head. Endemic to the Turimiquire region of northeastern Venezuela."
0,Urrao Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria urraoensis,https://ebird.org/species/antant1,"This antpitta has a very small range in the northern part of Colombia’s western Andes. It was described to science in 2010 and is considered highly endangered. Upperparts and hood are dull chestnut brown, and it has a gray breast and belly. Similar to Chestnut-naped Antpitta, but in Urrao the crown is much duller and throat is chestnut (not gray). Inhabits bamboo-laden understory of high elevation cloud forest, and usually very hard to see, though it sometimes visits a feeder within the Dusky Starfrontlet Nature Reserve. Song is three curt whistles; there is a pause after the first note, and the last note is higher."
0,Ursula's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris ursulae,https://ebird.org/species/urssun2,"A small, inconspicuous, and easily overlooked sunbird of mountain forests. At a distance, appears fairly uniform in color, but in good light the greenish back contrasts with the gray face, olive throat, pale belly, and reddish tufts on the sides of the body that are sometimes concealed by the wings. Bill is not overly long, but is distinctly curved. Within its range, most likely to be confused with Little Green Sunbird, but Ursula’s Sunbird has a plain face and more decurved, all black bill. Song varies, but always consists of sharp, high-pitched notes that are sometimes delivered as a jumble and sometimes as a single note followed by a descending pattern of quick, high pitched notes: “tsee-TSEE-TSI-tsi-tsi.”"
0,Usambara Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia montana,https://ebird.org/species/usaaka1,"A rather small, demure understory denizen resembling a cross between a robin and a flycatcher. Mostly dull brownish-olive with a rusty rump and tail, a paler throat, and a distinctive pale patch between the eye and bill. In display, may reveal a rufous spot near the eye. Juvenile is more mottled. A local and endangered bird found singly and in pairs in thick undergrowth of primary and secondary montane forest in a narrow range along the West Usambara mountains between 1600 and 2300 meters of elevation. Sits for long periods, sallying to catch insect prey, or forages on the ground, often in the company of ants and other ant-following birds. Sings a medley of up-and-down high-pitched whistles that is sweet without being tuneful. Alarm call is a grating “drrrzzt, drrrt, drrrt.” May be mistaken for a flycatcher, but its furtive nature and preference for thick understory are unique within its range."
0,Usambara Hyliota,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hyliotidae,Hyliota usambara,https://ebird.org/species/usahyl1,"A medium-sized, generic-looking warbler-like bird of Tanzania’s Usambara Mountains with a blue-black back, a white wing patch, and a pale breast suffused with a yellow-orange tinge. Found very locally in humid foothill forest, where it forages in the canopy and sometimes joins mixed flocks with other birds. Easily recognized as the only hyliota within its tiny range. Can appear warbler-like, but separated from all warblers by the white wing patch. The vocalizations are not well known and seem to be easy to overlook, but do include quiet “pit” notes."
0,Usambara Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus roehli,https://ebird.org/species/usathr1,"A typical thrush with brownish upperparts and paler rufous-and-gray underparts. Also note the darker face, yellow bill, and striped throat. Found in the understory of montane forest and along forest edges. Occasionally bold, but typically quite shy, with only calls betraying its presence in the undergrowth. Abyssinian Thrush is similar, but does not overlap in range. Usambara Thrush gives a typical melodic thrush song, and calls include a ""chk-chk"" and thin ""tseeep"" notes."
0,Usambara Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus nicolli,https://ebird.org/species/usawea1,"An unusual weaver with dark upperparts, an orange bib, and a yellow belly. The male shows a yellowish forehead patch that the female lacks. Found very locally in the upper levels of montane forest, usually in pairs that often join mixed-species flocks. Creeps along branches like a nuthatch. Somewhat similar to Forest Weaver, but easily separated by the orange breast. Vocalizations include a “seet-swit” call that is unusual for a weaver and a “radio static” song with a distinctively rollicking rhythm."
0,Ussher's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Bradornis ussheri,https://ebird.org/species/ussfly1,"An unusual small, chunky flycatcher. At a distance, looks entirely dark, but a good view reveals a slightly paler throat and a dark undertail with paler fringes. Has long, pointed wings and looks a bit like a swallow in flight. Found in rainforest and gallery forest, where it perches up on dead trees, especially at the forest edge and around clearings. Often in small groups. Similar to Sooty Flycatcher, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Ussher’s is separated by its darker underparts. Easily separated from other flycatchers by very dark plumage and unusual habits. Not very vocal, but does give a quiet, squeaky song."

0,Vampire Ground-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Geospiza septentrionalis,https://ebird.org/species/shbgrf1,"A rarely-seen Galápagos finch restricted to the islands of Darwin and Wolf. These islands are usually visited only by divers, so few birders have a chance to see this species. It was formerly considered a subspecies of Sharp-beaked Ground-Finch, and it has a similarly-shaped sharp, thin with nearly straight edges. Bill is black on breeding male and dull orange on female and nonbreeding male. Male’s plumage is sooty-black; female is brown with paler underparts that are streaked with gray. Its ominous name comes from its occasional habit of drinking blood, which it extracts from other animals by pecking until the skin is broken."
0,Van Dam's Vanga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Xenopirostris damii,https://ebird.org/species/vadvan1,"Large, big-billed vanga with white underparts. Males have a black hood, and females only a black cap. Rare Madagascar endemic that is found very locally in dry deciduous forest in the north and northwest. Can be found solo or in pairs, sometimes in flocks with other vangas. Most common vocalizations are long, penetrating whistles and a short scold. Separated from Lafresnaye’s and Pollen’s Vangas by range. Separated from Madagascar Cuckooshrike by much larger bill and white rather than gray underparts."
0,Van Hasselt's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Leptocoma brasiliana,https://ebird.org/species/vahsun1,"Attractive medium-sized sunbird of lowland forests, from coastal scrub forests to inland evergreen forests. Male is black with an iridescent pink-red throat, a red belly, and a glistening blue-green crown. Female is extensively yellowish with a pale vent and a thin dark line through the eye. Purple-throated Sunbird is essentially identical, but ranges do not overlap. Female Plain-throated Sunbird can be similar, but is straighter-billed, with a darker head, and a faint pale ring around the eye. Song, often given from an exposed perch, consists of squeaky rising whistles and chip notes."
0,Vanikoro Monarch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Mayrornis schistaceus,https://ebird.org/species/vanmon1,"A rather chunky flycatcher, mostly dark slate-gray with a pale eye-ring and obvious white undertail. Sometimes cocks and slightly fans tail, especially if aggravated. Dependent on primary forest. Apparently tolerant of old logged areas, but easily disturbed. Voice is a typical scolding “tchatchatcha.”"
0,Vanuatu Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Todiramphus farquhari,https://ebird.org/species/chbkin1,"A beautiful, boldly contrasting kingfisher with a blue head, a big black eye-mask, a white throat and neck, vibrant blue upperparts, and bright ginger underparts. Prefers undisturbed lowland forest. Often shy, sitting motionless in the canopy. Bright orange underparts separate it from other local kingfishers. Very vocal, giving a long series of chirping notes rising in pitch and speed."
0,Vanuatu Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma occulta,https://ebird.org/species/venpet1,"Rare and difficult to identify, this petrel is known to breed solely on the steep vegetated slopes of Vanua Lava, in northern Vanuatu. Most frequently reported in the seas surrounding Vanuatu, it likely ranges much further afield in the southwest Pacific; unfortunately, its similarity to other petrel species and the sparse coverage of that region make determining this difficult. Note neat black cap, bright white hindcollar, and black “M” across the uppersides of the wings. Extremely similar to White-necked Petrel; Vanuatu averages slightly smaller and smaller-billed overall, and with minimal amounts of white on the undersides of the primaries compared to White-necked. However, some Vanuatus can show significant white “tongues” in the primary undersides, and as such, identification remains extremely difficult away from the species’ core range in northern Vanuatu. Juan Fernandez Petrel can also be very similar, but lacks the bright white hindcollar and has even more extensive white tongues on the primary undersides. Typically solitary at sea, but can congregate in feeding flocks, sometimes with other species."
0,Variable Antshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Thamnophilus caerulescens,https://ebird.org/species/varant1,"Small antshrike with extensive plumage variation among subspecies for both sexes. Found in the lower and middle levels of woodland and second growth. Typical males are dark gray with a dark cap, white wing coverts, and a white-tipped tail. Andean subspecies are black above and black or barred below. Females are rusty-brown, with most having well marked, spotted wingbars. The song is a loud and fast series of 7 “ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka” notes."
0,Variable Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter hiogaster,https://ebird.org/species/vargos1,"A common, mid-sized raptor of forest edge in the lowlands and foothills. Three distinct color morphs occur. The common one has slate-gray above and rufous below, plus all gray and all white morphs. Scans for prey from a perch. Similar to Collared Sparrowhawk and Brown Goshawk, but Variable is larger and lack any rufous collar. Common call, a quick series or regular squeaky calls, “ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki-ki!”"
0,Variable Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus pyrrhopterus,https://ebird.org/species/epaori4,"Slender oriole with a long tail and straight bill. Entirely black apart from the shoulders, which can be chestnut or yellow and the thighs, which can be yellow or black depending on the subspecies. Found at the edge of humid forests, in wooded savannas, and in urban parks and gardens. Builds a globe-shaped nest. In the nonbreeding season may accompany mixed-species flocks. The song is fast and variable including songs and calls of other birds."
0,Variable Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/varoys1,"A large, stocky shorebird endemic to New Zealand. Adults vary in color from all black to pied, with a range of intermediate morphs in between. Juveniles have a dark-tipped bill, browner plumage, and gray legs. A coastal bird, breeding on sandy beaches, sand spits, rocky coasts, and occasionally the shores of coastal lakes. Will forage in paddocks. Gives a loud piping alarm call. Pied-morph birds appear similar to South Island Pied Oystercatcher (SIPO) and Chatham Oystercatcher. Adult pied-morph Variable Oystercatchers are visibly larger, with smudgy border between pied plumage on breast. Also note less white showing forward of folded wing around “shoulder.”"
0,Variable Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sporophila corvina,https://ebird.org/species/varsee3,"Small seed-eating bird of humid tropical lowlands; fairly common. Found in grassy and weedy areas and forest edges, often in same places as slightly larger Thick-billed Seed-Finch. In pairs or small flocks, mixing readily with Morelet's Seedeaters and other seed-eating birds. Note stubby bill (unlike Thick-billed Seed-Finch) and plain brownish olive plumage of female (not rich brown like seed-finch). Males in Mexico and most of Central America are black. In southern Central America and South America males have variable amounts of white on the underparts and rump, hence the name."
0,Variable Shrikethrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Colluricincla fortis,https://ebird.org/species/litshr5,"A chunky bird with a thick bill. Quite plain: brownish on the back, grayish on the head, and paler below, with indistinct breast streaking. Color of the underparts varies geographically from dull rufous to whitish-buff. Found at low and middle elevations in humid forest, including secondary forest. Rich, melodious, variable song consists of several penetrating whistles, generally in an up-and-down pattern. Calls include “chek” notes. Somewhat similar to Rusty Pitohui, but smaller, with a dark rather than pale eye. Also similar to Gray Shrikethrush, but smaller, shorter-tailed, and browner, with a darker face. Could be confused with female Black Shrikethrush, but always smaller and paler."
0,Variable Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris venustus,https://ebird.org/species/varsun2,"Medium-sized sunbird with strikingly different breeding male and female plumages. Breeding males are green on the head and back, with a purple band across the breast. There is much regional variation; the belly can be yellow-orange, yellow, or white, though it is yellow across most of the range. Some subspecies also show extensive purple onto the throat. Females and non-breeding males are plain olive-brown on the back and dull yellow below. Found in a broad range of habitats, from arid thornscrub to moist savanna, gardens, and forest edge. Vocalizations typical of a sunbird, and include a quick jumbled song. Similar to Collared Sunbird, but larger, with a longer and more curved bill."
0,Variable Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe picata,https://ebird.org/species/varwhe1,"Well-named; black-and-white pattern of the males is striking but varies considerably. Brownish female is not as noticeably variable, but also can be considerably darker or lighter-colored. Note black-and-white tail in all plumages. Inhabits arid and barren foothills, plateaus, valleys, and mountains, where it forages from a perch and on the ground."
0,Varied Bunting,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Passerina versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/varbun,"Seemingly dark and dull at a distance, males sport a spectacular color pattern when seen up close. Note red nape and throat, brilliant blue forehead, purplish cheek, and red arcs behind the eyes. Body is rich purple set off by a blue rump. Female is exceptionally plain. She is a warm, medium-brown with very few markings, distinguished from other female buntings by plainer wings and belly and curved top of the bill. Prefers brushy habitats often with steep slopes, especially riparian areas and desert washes. Generally uncommon. Listening for their song, a low, rough warble, is often the best way to find them."
0,Varied Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Gavicalis versicolor,https://ebird.org/species/varhon1,"Medium-sized honeyeater typically found in mangroves and adjacent coastal habitats. Back is brown-green; underparts are pale yellow with gray streaking. Black bill, yellow throat, and black patches over the eye. Much yellower than Mangrove Honeyeater.

Yellow eyering in all plumages, but different subspecies vary tremendously in plumage, ranging from black-headed to white-headed, streaked and unstreaked; in flight all, show prominent pale wingstripe. Inhabits woodlands, where usually seen in small flocks that methodically clamber along tree trunks, probing for insects in bark. Birds give frequent “chip-chip” call as they forage."
0,Varied Solitaire,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Myadestes coloratus,https://ebird.org/species/varsol1,"Medium-sized thrush with extremely limited range at the border of Panama and Colombia. Unlikely to be mistaken—gray head and underparts with black face and brown back are unique. Also note its orange bill and legs. Sexes similar. Found in cloud forest from around 900–1,500 m, where it is most likely to be seen around a fruiting tree. More often heard than seen; listen for its flutelike song with ringing notes given at different pitches."
0,Varied Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Ixoreus naevius,https://ebird.org/species/varthr,"A beautiful, boldly-patterned thrush.

0,Waller's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Onychognathus walleri,https://ebird.org/species/walsta1,"A medium-sized starling with a fairly short, squared-off tail. The base color is blue-black, and females show a gray head and breast. The wings have a large red patch that is conspicuous in flight. Found in the canopy of montane forest. Often forms flocks. Gives a variety of sweet, whistling calls. Similar to Kenrick’s Starling, but larger and chunkier, with a red eye. Also has a shorter tail than other red-winged starlings."
0,Wandering Albatross,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Diomedeidae,Diomedea exulans,https://ebird.org/species/wanalb,"Huge albatross of the Southern Ocean; breeds locally on remote islands, but circles the globe on its travels. Plumage highly variable, but always has white underwings with small black tip. Only similar species that is equally large is Royal Albatross, which never has dirty brownish markings on head and body or a mostly black tail as seen on many Wandering Albatrosses. Juvenile Wandering starts out with a chocolate brown head and body and a white face patch; gradually attains adult plumage over many years. Oldest Wandering develops extensively white upperwings and a white tail, much like Royal, making older birds difficult to separate. Wandering lacks narrow black “lips” on bill of Royal, often has messier, more spotted pattern on upperwing, and can show diagnostic pinkish stain on cheeks, not shown by Royal."
0,Wandering Tattler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa incana,https://ebird.org/species/wantat1,"Medium-sized, gray shorebird with short yellow legs and straight bill. Elongated, horizontal posture. In breeding plumage, look for jaggedly barred underparts and thin white eyebrow; similar in winter but with plainer gray underparts. Usually found on rocks, where it typically forages independently while bobbing its tail up and down. Sometimes close to other rock-loving shorebirds like turnstones, Surfbird, and Rock Sandpiper. Compare with extremely similar Gray-tailed Tattler, which overlaps extensively in range in western Alaska, the South Pacific, Australia, and parts of Asia. Wandering is more closely associated with rocky habitats as opposed to beaches and mudflats, but this shouldn’t be used as a definitive field mark. Plumage differences are very subtle. In breeding plumage, Wandering averages coarser and more extensive barring on underparts, and juveniles usually have darker gray flanks. All ages have a longer groove on the upper mandible. Best characteristic is voice: Wandering typically gives a ringing trilled call, much different than Gray-tailed’s two- or three-noted “too-wee” call."
0,Wandering Whistling-Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Dendrocygna arcuata,https://ebird.org/species/wawduc1,"Medium-sized dark whistling-duck with cream-colored flank plumes. Unlike Plumed Whistling-Duck, these plumes do not stick out and appear painted on the flanks. Often in smaller flocks around lakes, ponds, and dams. As the name suggests, note whistling call."
0,Warbling Doradito,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Pseudocolopteryx flaviventris,https://ebird.org/species/wardor1,"Small two-toned flycatcher, olive-brown above and yellow below. Note the rufescent crown patch. Found in tall-grass marshes, especially those with sedges. Typically difficult to locate, but during migration can be found in various areas with tall grass. The call is a series of nasal squeaky notes: “chek, chek, chek, chek-chick-chick-chiquetik.” The rather similar Dinelli's Doradito has a more olive-colored, less brownish back."
0,Warbling Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo gilvus,https://ebird.org/species/warvir,"Rather nondescript vireo with a blank face. Pale grayish-olive overall with a faint white eyebrow, darker grayish crown, and pale yellowish wash on the sides. Often confused with Philadelphia Vireo; note Warbling shows brightest color on sides (not throat) and fainter dark eyeline (especially indistinct in front of the eye). Warbling is also longer-tailed and has a slightly longer, thinner bill than Philadelphia. Scratchy warbling song is heard from treetops, particularly in riparian areas and cottonwoods. Migrants and wintering birds can be found in any wooded habitat, as far south as Central America."
0,Ward's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Pseudobias wardi,https://ebird.org/species/warfly1,"Small black-and-white vanga that looks uncannily like a monarch flycatcher. Madagascar endemic that is found in the canopy of eastern rainforest at middle elevations. Call is a short, burped trill. Usually seen in pairs, sometimes joining mixed flocks with other bird species. Overall coloration, including black band across the chest, unlike other birds in its range."
0,Ward's Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Harpactes wardi,https://ebird.org/species/wartro1,"A sluggish bird of mature tropical hill forests. A small head and prominent pale eye-ring give it a comically surprised appearance. Male has a wine-purple back, a scarlet belly, and a red plush patch on the forehead. Female is brownish with a yellow cap and underparts. Like other trogons, usually still and hard to detect on a low or mid-level perch, from which it sallies out to take insects, fruits, and seeds. Song is a series of bubbling hoots that accelerate and rise, then taper off gradually towards the end."
0,Warsangli Linnet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Linaria johannis,https://ebird.org/species/warlin1,"A fine-billed finch with a notched tail. Neatly patterned mostly in gray and white, with black wings and tail and a rufous lower back and thighs. Male has a striking white eyebrow, lower cheek patch, wing notch, and rump. Female is duller, with a less striking facial pattern; juvenile is buffier and streakier. A rare resident in the hilly Daalo and Mash Caleed regions of northern Somalia, where it prefers degraded juniper forest and other woodland and scrub between 1200 and 2400 meters of elevation. Forages on the ground in pairs or small groups, and perches on exposed branches and dead trees. Sings a typical canary-like song with whistles, trills, and buzzes. Calls include a high-pitched “tsee-wit.” Streaky juvenile could be confused with a canary, but white in the wing is distinctive."
0,Water Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus spinoletta,https://ebird.org/species/watpip1,"Fairly common but often local, especially in winter. Breeds in mountains on barren, often rocky ground; winters in varied wetland habitats, from lakeshores to salt marshes. Breeding plumage grayish above with white eyebrow; breast pale pinkish, mostly unstreaked. Nonbreeding plumage grayish brown above, whitish below with dark streaks. Sides of tail clean white, versus dingy whitish on Rock Pipit, which can occur in same coastal areas in winter. Call a high, lisping, slightly upslurred ""ssiip"", very similar to Rock Pipit call."
0,Water Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus aquaticus,https://ebird.org/species/watrai1,"Shy but generally not uncommon, this reclusive marsh bird is more often heard than seen; listen for its varied piglike squeals and grunts coming from dense vegetation. Favors fresh marshes and ponds with taller vegetation, especially reeds and rushes; in winter and freezing weather, sometimes in tidal marshes. Most often seen at muddy edges, walking stealthily; can move very quickly. About half the size of a moorhen. Note long, mostly red bill (unlike short, chickenlike bill of crakes), and barred flanks. Replaced in much of Asia by the Brown-cheeked Rail, with which it has minor overlap; very similar, but lacks the strong eye stripe of that species, has a darker throat and grayer breast and belly."
0,Watercock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Gallicrex cinerea,https://ebird.org/species/waterc1,"Large, distinctive marsh dweller, elusive and often difficult to see in the heavily vegetated wet fields and marshes it inhabits. Male is unmistakable, with black body, brown-edged wing coverts, and red-and-yellow bill with raised, spiky red frontal shield (unlike smaller moorhen). Females and immature are similarly large but speckled brown above with tan faces, and lack male’s frontal shield. Males are very vocal when breeding, producing liquid-sounding gulps comparable to a water bottle emptying. Both sexes make a range of incisive, guttural clucking and creaking calls, as well as a sharp “keek” in alarm."
0,Watkins's Antpitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Grallariidae,Grallaria watkinsi,https://ebird.org/species/watant1,"Medium-sized antpitta with limited range in dry woodlands in southwest Ecuador and northwest Peru. Fairly common and unmistakable within range and habitat. Typical antpitta shape: plump and short-tailed with long legs, like a grapefruit on stilts. Brown above with bold streaking on underparts, messy-looking face, and a tawny crown. Looks like a washed-out version of Chestnut-crowned Antpitta, which occurs at higher elevations (and typically in wetter forests). Voice is distinctive: a descending series of rich whistles ending with a longer rising note. Usually secretive, but can be detected as it noisily hops through dry leaf litter."
0,Wattled Broadbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Eurylaimidae,Sarcophanops steerii,https://ebird.org/species/watbro1,"A medium-sized bird of lowland and foothill forest on Mindanao and neighboring islands, with a pale blue bill and eye wattle, a black face, a streaked crown, a dark back with a white-and-yellow wingbar, a white collar, and a reddish rump and tail. Underparts are white in the female and pinkish in the male. Makes short sallies from a perched position to catch insects. Can be found in pairs, small groups, or sometimes mixed-species flocks.

0,Wattled Brushturkey,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Aepypodius arfakianus,https://ebird.org/species/watbrt1,"A large, black ground bird of montane rainforests. Bare facial skin is pale-blue in the male and dull gray in the female. Red wattles on the head and chest are reduced in the female. Very shy and difficult to see. Roams the forest floor, scraping leaves to uncover fallen fruit, seeds and invertebrates. Similar to other brushturkeys but Wattled has a vertically-flattened tail with maroon rump and darker legs. Usually quiet but can give a sharp series of “ki! kekekekekeke” with the first note higher."
0,Wattled Crane,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Gruidae,Bugeranus carunculatus,https://ebird.org/species/watcra2,"A large, grayish crane with a gleaming white neck, conspicuous wattles, and red facial skin. The immature is duller and lacks wattles, but it retains the distinctive pale neck of the adult. It requires sedge-dominated wetlands for breeding but will forage on adjacent grasslands and plains, where it digs for tubers, insects, and small vertebrates. The Wattled Crane is resident in larger wetlands, where it breeds in pairs, although flocks of up to 1,000 may gather after breeding. It is locally nomadic in smaller perennial wetlands in alpine grasslands. Although it is mostly silent, it has a distinctive, rapid, screechy “Koorok-kreek” call."
0,Wattled Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Crax globulosa,https://ebird.org/species/watcur1,"Very large black gamebird with a red bill. Males have a white ventral region which is chestnut in females. Strongly associated with riparian environments, especially seasonally flooded forest and river islands, where it is quite arboreal. Now very rare over much of its range because of overhunting."
0,Wattled Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Aburria aburri,https://ebird.org/species/watgua1,"Distinctive guan: all black with cerulean bill, yellowish-orange legs, and thin yellow dewlap. Could be confused with Sickle-winged Guan, which is smaller and has warm brown underparts. Occurs in the subtropical zone of the Andes from Venezuela to Peru, from around 1,200 to 2,200 m. Surprisingly difficult to see as it forages in the middle to upper levels of dense forest; rarely perches in the open. Most often detected by its amazing voice, a strange alien-like call that rises and falls."
0,Wattled Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Bostrychia carunculata,https://ebird.org/species/watibi1,"A dark ibis with a shaggy crest and a small wattle below the bill that is difficult to see. White patches in the wings are distinctive, especially in flight. Found in montane habitats including grasslands, marshes, moorlands, and even urban lawns. Often in small flocks.

0,Wattled Jacana,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Jacanidae,Jacana jacana,https://ebird.org/species/watjac1,"Striking marsh bird, medium-sized with exceptionally long toes. In some regions adult is entirely black; other populations more similar to Northern Jacana with rufous upperparts. Always has red forehead and wattle at base of bill. Juveniles very similar to Northern Jacana: bronzy-brown above with white underparts and eyebrow; note yellow bill and long toes to separate from other marsh birds. All ages show yellow wings in flight. Found in wetlands, usually with a combination of grasses and lily pads."
0,Wattled Ploughbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Eulacestomatidae,Eulacestoma nigropectus,https://ebird.org/species/watplo1,"A fairly small, plump bird with a unique bill shape of montane forest. Male is yellow-green with black wing, chest, and two large, pink, fleshy wattles beside the bill. The female is olive-green with paler underparts. Forages low and especially likes climbing bamboo. Uses its strong bill to strip wood and dig into branches. Male plumage is unique, but even with the female’s non-descript plumage, the bill shape should be a give-away. Voice, a single, long, high-pitch note."
0,Wattled Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Creatophora cinerea,https://ebird.org/species/watsta1,"A medium-sized gray-brown starling with dark wings and tail and a whitish rump. The pale bill and lemon-yellow facial skin in females and non-breeding males is subdued, but breeding males often acquire long, fleshy, dangling black wattles and canary-yellow naked skin on the head. This nomad always tends to be in groups, and breeds opportunistically in colonies. It occurs irregularly and is irruptive in short grasslands and open savannas; at any given location it may number in the thousands in some years, and be absent in others. It may associate with large mammals, capturing insects that they flush. Both sexes give a variety of squeaks and hissing notes."

0,West African Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis occulta,https://ebird.org/species/weabat1,"A classically patterned batis of forest, forest edges, villages, and towns in tropical lowlands and foothills. Males have white underparts bisected by a black chest band, mostly black upperparts with a broken white eye-line, white on the nape, scalloped white and gray on the back, and a white wingbar that extends to the tip of the wings in the secondary flight feathers. The female is similar but has less of an eyebrow, a grayer crown and back, and a reddish chest band. Overlaps with several other batis species, but note West African Batis’s combination of broken eyebrow and neat chest band. Song is a high-pitched series of buzzy calls and trills interspersed with whistles, often with the same whistled call being repeated at length."
0,West African Crested Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Thalasseus albididorsalis,https://ebird.org/species/royter2,"A large tern found strictly in coastal areas. Very pale, with a long forked tail. Shows a black cap and orange bill in breeding plumage, and a white cap, black back of the head, and yellow-orange bill when not breeding. Feeds in open ocean and saltwater bays, where it flies above the water looking for small fish. Rests on beaches, often in mixed groups with other tern species. Separated from most other terns by large size; only slightly smaller than Caspian. Separated from Caspian by the thinner orange bill (usually not deep red), shaggier crest, longer tail, and in flight the much paler wing, without a large panel of solid black. Similar to Lesser Crested Tern, but significantly larger and chunkier."

0,West Indian Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/weiwoo1,"A medium-sized woodpecker of drier forests including palm groves. Its strongly barred back eliminates all other species in it range except for Northern and Fernandina’s Flickers, but both flickers lack the West Indian Woodpecker’s extensively red nape and hind-crown. The barring on the back of the Northern Flicker is also far less pronounced than it is on West Indian Woodpecker. Common vocalizations include a staccato “pee-uh-uh-uh-uh…” with accent on first note, and emphatic bursts of “bluhhh, bluhhh, bluhhh,” with notes that are both harsh and slightly trilled."
0,West Mexican Chachalaca,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Ortalis poliocephala,https://ebird.org/species/wemcha1,"Noisy, long-tailed game bird of tropical forest and edge, usually found in small groups. Most often detected by its raucous song, which carries well. It feeds on fruit and plant material on the ground and also high in trees, where it runs along branches. For a big bird, it can be surprisingly hard to see. It is wary in areas where it is hunted and it slips away from view quite easily. In southwest Chiapas, the smaller White-bellied Chachalaca lives in coastal lowlands, while the West Mexican Chachalaca lives in foothills."
0,West Peruvian Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Zenaida meloda,https://ebird.org/species/wepdov1,"Common and conspicuous dove of desert lowlands and foothills.

0,Western Crowned Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus occipitalis,https://ebird.org/species/weclew1,"Distinctive leaf warbler with two wingbars, green upperparts often contrasting with the gray head and the striking white underparts, a distinct crown stripe, and a long pale bill. Endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Breeds in the western and central Himalayas. Winters primarily in southern India. Only leaf warbler other than Tickell’s Leaf Warbler to regularly participate in mixed-species foraging flocks in southern India. Similar to Blyth’s Leaf Warbler, but is less yellow and can be distinguished by its paler crown, more elongated appearance, and song."
0,Western Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Chlorostilbon melanorhynchus,https://ebird.org/species/weseme1,"Small hummingbird usually found in fairly open dry habitats or forest edges in western Ecuador and Colombia, from 600–1,800 m but locally higher in Andean valleys. Males are entirely shimmering emerald green with dark blue tail. Short straight bill. Females green above and pale gray below with dark cheek and white line behind eye. Both sexes are extremely similar to Blue-tailed Emerald but no range overlap. Otherwise unlikely to be confused given small size and plumage. Typically seen singly feeding at lower or middle levels in gardens or edges; visits feeders."
0,Western Fieldwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Calamanthus montanellus,https://ebird.org/species/ruffie3,"Small bird of open arid shrubland and grasslands in southwestern Western Australia. Pale brown above, whitish below, with distinct pale supercilium, streaking on head chest, and long, cocked tail. Forages quietly on the ground or in thick vegetation, where difficult to see. Most easily observed in spring when males perch up in vegetation to sing. Similar to Rufous Fieldwren but no range overlap. Compare Shy Heathwren, which has an unstreaked back and head, white wing spot and darker legs."
0,Western Gerygone,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Gerygone fusca,https://ebird.org/species/wesger1,"Small plain bird with thin bill. Upperparts gray, underparts grayish or whitish, with distinctive black-and-white tail pattern (best seen in flight), thin pale eyering, and red eye. Juvenile lacks red eye and has yellow gape (base of bill). Inhabits woodlands in drier, inland regions of Australia, where it is the only gerygone."
0,Western Grasswren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Amytornis textilis,https://ebird.org/species/thbgra1,"Small brownish bird with fine white streaking and long cocked tail, found in dense coastal shrubland of the Shark Bay area of Western Australia and the northeastern Eyre Peninsula in South Australia near Whyalla (two different subspecies).

0,Western Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Aechmophorus occidentalis,https://ebird.org/species/wesgre,"Large, long-necked grebe with very long, thin, yellow bill. Black cap extends below red eye, sometimes with just a small white spot in front of the eye. Long, gray body rides low in the water. Breeds on marshy lakes, where it builds a floating nest of vegetation. Mostly found on saltwater bays and open ocean in winter, but also lakes. Very similar to Clark’s Grebe, with extensive range overlap and often in mixed flocks. Typically outnumbers Clark’s where they occur together. Western looks darker overall, especially on the sides and face. Also look at the bill: duller yellow on Western, often with a slight greenish tinge, and with a dark lower edge. Some birds appear intermediate and should be left unidentified."
0,Western Mountain Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Arizelocichla tephrolaema,https://ebird.org/species/wesmog1,"A large, vocal greenbul of montane forest and forest edge, found only in the highlands of Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), Cameroon, and eastern Nigeria. Has an olive-green body, a more yellow-green belly, an ashy-gray head, dark reddish eyes surrounded by white partial eye-arcs, and a solid black bill.

0,Western Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus occidentalis,https://ebird.org/species/wesgul,"Large, stocky gull with a stout bill. Adults have rather dark gray upperparts and bright pink legs. Takes four years for immatures to progress from mostly brown to fully white and gray adult plumage; intermediate plumages are often mottled and messy. Starts to develop dark gray back in second year. At all ages, look for overall stocky shape and large bill. Strictly coastal, occurring along beaches and bays along the Pacific coast. Commonly seen around coastal towns and cities, but almost never ventures inland. Identification is muddied by frequent hybridization, especially with Glaucous-winged Gull at the northern end of its range. Hybrids can show any mix of intermediate traits; some are best left unidentified."
0,Western Kingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Tyrannus verticalis,https://ebird.org/species/weskin,"Fairly large yellow-bellied flycatcher; common and widespread in western North America. Rather pale gray head with weakly contrasting whitish throat and breast, and lemon-yellow belly. Also look for black tail with white edges (but this can be difficult to see, especially when worn).

Compare especially with Cassin’s Kingbird, which is darker and more contrasting on the head. Winters in large numbers south to Costa Rica, often gathering in large loose groups during migration."
0,Western Meadowlark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Sturnella neglecta,https://ebird.org/species/wesmea,"Streaked brown above and yellow below with distinctive black ""V"" on breast. In flight, short wings and spiky tail with white outer feathers are apparent. Breeds in fields and grasslands throughout much of western North America, regularly as far east as Michigan. Winters in a wider range of open habitats, even agricultural fields and roadsides. Extremely similar to Eastern Meadowlark and best distinguished by voice: listen for musical gurgling song and ""chuk"" calls. In winter, plumage looks paler and more washed-out than Eastern Meadowlark, with a less contrasting head pattern. Western is also more likely to be in flocks and areas with shorter grass (less pristine, extensive grasslands)."
0,Western Nicator,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nicatoridae,Nicator chloris,https://ebird.org/species/yesnic1,"An unusual bushshrike-like bird with a heavy hooked bill, olive-green above and pale below with bold white spotting on the wings. The yellow corners of the tail can be conspicuous in flight. Found in rainforest, gallery forest, thickets, lush secondary habitat, and dense woodland. Skulking and secretive, usually remaining in tangled understory and mid-level vegetation. Very similar to Eastern Nicator, but their ranges do not overlap. Also similar to Yellow-throated Nicator, but larger, without a bright yellow throat and streak above the eye. Very vocal and most often detected by voice; the song is a quick jumble of wooden notes, and the common call is a penetrating “chaak.”"
0,Western Olivaceous Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Iduna opaca,https://ebird.org/species/weowar1,"Large buff-colored warbler with a heavy flat bill and long tail. Olive-gray upperparts contrast with the pale bill. The pale lores separates this species from the similar Eastern Olivaceous Warbler and it doesn’t make downward tail movements like Eastern. Song contains several irregular notes and clicks. Found in light woodland gardens, orchards, plantations, oases and areas with dense bushes."
0,Western Black-headed Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus brachyrynchus,https://ebird.org/species/wbhori1,"An Old World oriole with mostly yellow plumage, a black hood, and a red bill. Note the fairly plain olive-and-black wing with a small white patch along the front edge. Found in rainforest canopy at low and middle elevations. Similar to Black-winged Oriole and found in the same habitat, but distinguished by the olive-green rather than black center of the tail and by the white patch on the wing. Also similar to African Black-headed Oriole, but usually separated by habitat and range. Further distinguished by the wing pattern, which is plainer, without bold white feather edgings."
0,Western Parotia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Parotia sefilata,https://ebird.org/species/wespar1,"A large bird of mid-montane forest canopy. Male is mainly black with a white patch on the forehead, bronzy-scaled chest and 6 antennalike feathers projecting from the back of the head. Note the blue eye.

Female similar to Vogelkop Lophorhina but Western Parotia female is larger with a moustache stripe and blue eyes. Vocalizations include parrotlike squawking and a loud nasal “raak!”."
0,Western Reef-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Egretta gularis,https://ebird.org/species/werher,"Gangly heron with significant variation in plumage. Distinct dark morph is slate-gray with a white throat, while the palest morph is white with a yellow bill and lores. Pale gray intermediate morphs can also be found. Little Egret can look similar, but it has a darker bill than the white morph of the Western Reef-Heron. Primarily a coastal inhabitant, foraging on shorelines and in estuaries, but can also be found at some inland water bodies."
0,Western Rock Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta neumayer,https://ebird.org/species/rocnut1,"Slightly larger than Eurasian Nuthatch. Bill is longer and stronger than Eurasian Nuthatch with paler underparts. It favors mountainous rocky habitats and is seen actively feeding on boulders and cliffs, not normally on trees like Eurasian Nuthatch. Eastern Rock Nuthatch is larger and heavier than Western Rock Nuthatch with a big bill and thicker black eye stripe. Builds a unique, huge mud nest that it sticks to cliffs and rocks and uses year-round. Song and call are a loud and bubbling series of descending whistles “Piu-piu-piu-piu…” or “Pi pi pi pu-pu-pu-pu…”"
0,Western Rosella,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Platycercus icterotis,https://ebird.org/species/wesros1,"Red-and-green rosella with a yellow cheek in adults. The only rosella found in southwestern Western Australia, where it inhabits open woodland habitats and parks, usually feeding on the ground. Adult mottled green and black (or red) above, with red underparts and crown, blue rump, and blue wings. Adult male has more intense colors than female; juvenile lacks yellow cheeks and is more extensively green. Two subspecies exist, varying in back color: the inland subspecies has a green-and-black back, the southwestern subspecies a red-and-black back. Call is a slow, ringing double note; also gives chattering calls."
0,Western Sandpiper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris mauri,https://ebird.org/species/wessan,"Small sandpiper with relatively long, droopy bill (longer on females). In breeding plumage, shows rich rufous tones on shoulders, cheeks, and crown. Nonbreeding is plain pale gray above and white below. Juveniles look pale-faced and have a bright strip of rufous feathers on the upper edge of the wings. Most similar to Semipalmated Sandpiper, which averages shorter-billed and duller grayish-brown overall. Extremely difficult to distinguish in winter; note Western is somewhat larger-headed and more front-heavy. Droopy bill might recall Dunlin, but Western is smaller and paler. Breeds on high Arctic tundra in Alaska. In migration and winter, occurs in large flocks on mudflats and beaches. Much more common in western North America; uncommon to rare on the east coast. Occurs in the winter in the U.S., unlike Semipalmated Sandpiper; regularly winters as far south as Peru, rare to Chile."
0,Western Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops kennicottii,https://ebird.org/species/wesowl1,"Pint-sized, cryptically patterned gray owl with fine streaks of black and white; short ear tufts. Found in a variety of wooded habitats, but favors riparian and deciduous areas. Can be found in urban areas and parks. Feeds mostly on small mammals, birds, and insects. Nests in cavities. Listen for its voice at night: a series of short whistled notes that accelerates at the end. Unlike counterpart, Eastern Screech-Owl, they do not have a rufous color morph, only gray morph."
0,Western Spindalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Spindalidae,Spindalis zena,https://ebird.org/species/wesspi,"Uncommon in thickets, forest edge, and gardens, where found mainly at fruiting trees and bushes. Usually in pairs or small flocks, and often quite inconspicuous. Handsome male is unmistakable, with bold head pattern, golden-yellow and dark reddish body plumage, and bold white wing pattern.

0,Western Striolated-Puffbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galbuliformes,Bucconidae,Nystalus obamai,https://ebird.org/species/wespuf1,"Chunky, bull-headed puffbird of lowland and foothill rainforest east of the Andes to far western Brazil. Underparts are pale with dark, vertical streaks. Also note stout, yellowish bill, and brown cap and back. Very similar to Eastern Striolated-Puffbird (limited overlap in Brazil and possibly Bolivia), but has thicker streaks on underparts. Singles or pairs perch motionless for long periods high in the canopy; usually heard before seen. Typical song is a whistled “wip wip-whirrr?, whurrrr”, with the other member of the pair responding at slightly different pitch."
0,Western Subalpine Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca iberiae,https://ebird.org/species/subwar6,"A small, slim warbler with a long tail. Breeding males are distinctive, with gray upperparts contrasting with a puffy rufous throat and breast, and a bold white moustache mark. Female and non-breeding males resemble a washed-out version of the breeding male, with much less rufous below. Typically found in scrubby, dense bushy habitats, but also in more open woodland and savanna. Sings from the tops of bushes, giving a rattling and loud sequence of notes. The call is a dry ""tek"" note, which is also incorporated into the song. Very similar to Moltoni’s Warbler, and best separated by call (single notes rather than dry rattles); breeding male is also richer rufous below. Also very similar to Eastern Subalpine Warbler, but call is subtly different: Western’s is slightly harsher, with only one syllable. Breeding males are separated visually from Eastern by having more rufous on the belly, a paler face, and a narrower white moustache."
0,Western Swamphen,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Porphyrio porphyrio,https://ebird.org/species/purswa1,"Fairly common but very local in Mediterranean region; escapes occur occasionally in northern Europe.

Call is a short, nasal wail."
0,Western Wattlebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Anthochaera lunulata,https://ebird.org/species/litwat1,"Medium-large honeyeater found in southwestern Australia, typically in scrub and dry coastal woodlands. Grayish brown overall with fine white streaking; pale tips to tail feathers and chestnut in primary feathers most easily observed in flight. Easily distinguished from Red Wattlebird by the lack of pink wattles below the eye and the lack of yellow lower belly. Often found near flowering Banksia, where it is typically very active and vocal, with rough, loud, squawking calls."
0,Western Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala fuliginosa,https://ebird.org/species/weswhi2,"Chunky, rounded songbird with heavy, thick bill, found in southwestern Australia, as well as southeastern South Australia and western Victoria.

Breeds in New Zealand and ranges across the temperate South Pacific to Chile, where it is uncommon to locally fairly common in the Humboldt Current and fjords. Often found with much commoner, but very similar White-chinned Petrel and is not easily identified unless distinct black bill tip of Westland can be seen (White-chinned has pale bill tip). Slightly smaller Parkinson’s Petrel looks very similar to Westland, but favors warmer tropical and subtropical waters and has a smaller, more rounded head and slightly slimmer bill."
0,Wetar Figbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Sphecotheres hypoleucus,https://ebird.org/species/wetfig1,"A distinctive oriole confined to Wetar. A medium-sized, heavyset songbird with a stout bill. Male is striking, with a black head, obvious red skin around the eye, an olive upperside, and clean white underparts. Female is entirely gray-brown with extensive bold streaks on the underside. Juvenile resembles a poorly-streaked female. Groups occur in forest, edge, scrub, and cultivated areas. Male is unmistakable; heavily streaked underparts and bulky shape of female unlike any other species in range. Complex, chattering, buzzing starling-like song contains imitations of local birds. Call is a strident “WICK!”"
0,Wetar Ground Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Alopecoenas hoedtii,https://ebird.org/species/wegdov1,"A fairly large ground-dwelling forest dove. Male is mostly dark with a diagnostic pale head and breast. Upperparts are rufous-brown, head pale gray, belly blackish-brown, and throat, neck, and breast cream-colored.

Brown on the back and sides with a red belly, a blue chest, tail, and edge of the wing, rufous on the back of the head, a dark face with a pale moustache, and a pale line behind the eye. Very similar to Blue-breasted Pitta, but Whiskered usually occurs at higher elevations, has an obvious whisker on the face, and has a brown rather than green back. Song is a long, mournful downslurred note followed by several shorter ones, “doooo doo-doo-doo-doo!”"
0,Whiskered Screech-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Megascops trichopsis,https://ebird.org/species/whsowl1,"Small owl restricted to oak woodlands in canyons and foothills in Mexico, barely reaching into southeast Arizona and southwest New Mexico. Finely patterned in gray, black, and white. Very similar to Western Screech-Owl; best distinguished by voice. Two song types: one a relatively even series of five to eight ""toot"" notes; the other sounds like morse code: ""toot-toot, toot, toot, toot-toot, toot."" Also note paler bill than Western Screech-Owl."
0,Whiskered Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Chlidonias hybrida,https://ebird.org/species/whiter2,"Small buoyant tern. Breeding adult has distinctive dark smoky gray body and contrasting white cheeks (can look like broad white ""whiskers"" in flight) underneath a black cap. Nonbreeding plumage pale silvery gray overall with a faded shadow of the cap; juvenile has dark-checkered back. Note rather stout bill (albeit thinner than Gull-billed Tern) and square tail; compare to Common, Roseate, and Arctic Terns. Feeds by picking from surface, not splash-diving like typical terns. Common around wetlands, lakes, and rivers."
0,Whiskered Treeswift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Hemiprocnidae,Hemiprocne comata,https://ebird.org/species/whitre1,"Elongated white “whiskers” and brows give this elegant species the appearance of a wise old man. Long-tailed and long-winged, like a cross between a swift and a swallow. Glossy brownish-olive with glossy blue-black wings and head. Male has chestnut ear patches, while the female has bluish ones. Sallies from exposed perches in the canopy and along clearings in lowland and foothill wet forests. Gives squeaky, excited-sounding calls and high-pitched chattering."
0,Whiskered Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Pheugopedius mystacalis,https://ebird.org/species/whiwre1,"Fairly large wren, found in foothills and subtropics from Venezuela to western Ecuador. More often heard than seen; listen for rich whistled song usually given in widely spaced repeated phrases. Rufous above and pale grayish below, with striped black-and-white face pattern. Black bars on tail, unlike similar Plain-tailed Wren, which is found at higher elevations. Sexes similar. Skulks in thickets and tangles at the forest edge, usually in pairs."
0,Whiskered Yuhina,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Yuhina flavicollis,https://ebird.org/species/whiyuh1,"Distinguished-looking small songbird with a brown mohawk of a crest. Brown above and white below with an orange nape and a small black mustache stripe. Slender white eye crescents give it a “spectacled” appearance on top of a whiskered one. Like other yuhinas, a very social bird, often seen foraging in the lower and middle levels of hilly broadleaf forests, sometimes with other species. Calls are usually an explosive pair or triad of notes that can be likened to “pee-bee!” or “pee-ah-bee!”"
0,Whistler's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus whistleri,https://ebird.org/species/whiwar2,"One of a confusingly similar complex of species, this medium-sized warbler has a bright yellow eye-ring, a pale and indistinct wingbar, and a grayish crown bordered by two long black stripes. The weakness and greenish cast of the gray crown separates this species from various other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, such as Gray-crowned. Golden-spectacled Warbler is very similar; in Whistler’s, look out for an unbroken eye-ring, a shorter bill, a longer tail, and slightly duller green upperparts. Whistler’s breeds in high-altitude temperate broadleaf forest from around 2000 meters up to the treeline; averages higher in altitudinal breeding preferences than Golden-spectacled Warbler. Like other “golden-spectacled”-type warblers, Whistler’s typically forages at lower and middle levels of forest, often mixing with other species and making flycatching sallies. Song consists of a 2- or 3-noted whistled phrase repeated 2-3 times without pause, lacking the trills of Golden-spectacled Warbler."
0,Whistling Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola lateralis,https://ebird.org/species/whicis1,"Large, plain cisticola. The most outstanding aspects of the plumage are the white underparts and two bands across the tip of the tail, one pale and one black. Found in a variety of open habitats, including moist savanna, scrub, overgrown cultivation, and forest edge and clearings. The distinctive song is a quick, liquid warble, given from a prominent perch. As with other cisticolas, habitat and vocalizations are important to identification.

0,Woodhouse's Scrub-Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma woodhouseii,https://ebird.org/species/wooscj2,"Attractive jay of oak woodlands and piñon-juniper forests. Royal blue above with gray-brown back and dirty grayish underparts. Flight style is often distinctive, a series of quick wingbeats followed by a stiff glide. Typically in small groups. Listen for scratchy, nasal calls. Regularly visits backyards and feeders. Most similar to California Scrub-Jay (and once considered the same species), but usually separable by range. Also note Woodhouse’s Scrub-Jay is paler and more washed-out, with only a diffuse blue breast band. Population in central Mexico, often called Sumichrast’s Scrub-Jay, is darker and more contrasty than a typical Woodhouse’s, and might be a separate species."
0,Woodland Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Halcyon senegalensis,https://ebird.org/species/wookin1,"A medium-sized, electric-blue-backed kingfisher with a distinctive bicolored bill: red above and black below. Pairs and singles mostly hunt insects in taller dry woodland, riverine forest, and forest edges. Its loud and characteristic call is a high-pitched “tuuui”, followed by a pause and then a trilling, down-slurred “trrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr”. Sometimes it advertises by sitting upright, extending its wings to show a bold wing pattern, and calling. Almost all of Africa’s other similar kingfishers have a uniformly red-orange (not bicolored) bill, except the Blue-breasted Kingfisher, which differs by being larger, having a complete pale-blue breast band, and preferring denser lowland rainforest."

0,Yucatan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes pygmaeus,https://ebird.org/species/yucwoo,"Like a small version of Golden-fronted Woodpecker. Found in woodland, beach scrub, semi-open wooded habitats; usually less numerous than Golden-fronted. Yucatan populations of Golden-fronted Woodpecker very similar in plumage, but Yucatan Woodpecker has a much shorter bill, ‘egg-yolk’ yellow feathering around the bill base (vs. reddish on local Golden-fronteds), and relatively wider white barring on back (looks silvery at a distance, vs. blackish overall on Golden-fronted). Voice is quite different from Golden-fronted."
0,Yucatan Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Campylorhynchus yucatanicus,https://ebird.org/species/yucwre1,"Large, boldly marked wren of dry coastal scrub along north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula; no similar species in its range. Found in pairs or small groups, usually in areas with cactus plants. The upperparts are marked with a complex pattern of streaks and bars, the tail tipped whitish on the corners. The breast and belly have sparse dark spotting."
0,Yungas Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope bridgesi,https://ebird.org/species/dulgua3,"Large guan with a long tail and red throat wattle. Dark brown overall with extensive white markings on wings. Unlike most other members of its genus, Yungas has dull grayish legs. Found in montane forests and edges. Listen for loud, harsh calls often given in a series. Restricted range in northwestern Argentina and southern Bolivia. Usually in pairs or small groups; often seen feeding at fruiting trees, but can be seen walking on the ground."
0,Yungas Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Chiroxiphia boliviana,https://ebird.org/species/yunman1,"Fairly large manakin of montane forest habitats. Males are black with a blue back and red cap; females are dull olive green. Both sexes have a dark brown eye. Found at higher elevations than similar Blue-backed Manakin. Favors the understory of mossy forest, including on outlying ridges. Listen for its loud whistled calls."
0,Yungas Pygmy-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium bolivianum,https://ebird.org/species/yupowl1,"Small brown-and-white owl found in humid montane habitats. Variably reddish or grayish brown, with white spotting throughout and a black-and-white false eye pattern on the back of its head characteristic of pygmy-owls. Found in humid habitats at higher elevations than other pygmy-owls. Listen for its tooting song, usually given at a pace of about two toots per second."
0,Yungas Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Rhynchospiza dabbenei,https://ebird.org/species/stcspa2,"Attractive sparrow found along the western edge of the Andes in northwestern Argentina, barely reaching over the border into Bolivia. Note the chestnut head stripes, dark smudge between eye and bill, and black and white mustache. Similar to Chaco Sparrow, with which it was formerly lumped as Stripe-capped Sparrow, but is larger with more extensive black on the face, rustier wings, and a different voice. Inhabits open, grassy habitats with scattered trees and low scrub. Song is a slow series of wheezy chirps."
0,Yungas Tyrannulet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Phyllomyias weedeni,https://ebird.org/species/yuntyr1,"Small flycatcher found along the east slope of the Andes in western Bolivia, barely reaching over the border into southern Peru. Note the stubby bill, indistinct wingbars, and white eyebrow bordered below by a dark eye-line. Similar to Sclater’s Tyrannulet, but lacks a white throat and has less prominent wingbars. Inhabits the canopy of humid forest, and typical song is a series of three to five descending, whiny whistles. Note that some vocally distinct birds found farther north in Peru as well in western Brazil may belong to this species, but pending further research, could also be a form of Sooty-headed Tyrannulet or something completely new."
0,Yunnan Fulvetta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Alcippe fratercula,https://ebird.org/species/gycful4,"Active and noisy inhabitant of foothill and highland forest. Brown with a gray head, white eyering, and a long black arc that extends from just above the bill to the back of the crown. Frequently joins mixed flocks, of which it is often a dominant member. Extremely similar in appearance to the closely related Huet’s and David’s Fulvettas; watch for a grayer throat and paler underparts in the former and an absent or near-invisible brow line in the latter. Song is a quick, sputtering burst of high notes that ends with a brief whistle. Calls are chattering rattles."
0,Yunnan Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta yunnanensis,https://ebird.org/species/yunnut1,"An uncommon and dull nuthatch of open primary pine forests. Distinctive in its plainness, lacking any bright coloration; gray-backed and white-bellied, with a black line running from the eye to the shoulder. Does not have any warm colors under the vent, unlike Chestnut-vented and Eurasian Nuthatches."
0,Zamboanga Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Hypsipetes rufigularis,https://ebird.org/species/zambul1,"A medium-sized bird of foothill forest and edge in western Mindanao and on adjacent islands. Dark brown above with a grayish-brown streaked crown, a white belly, white under the base of the tail, and a warm reddish-brown throat, cheek, and chest. Note the strong black bill. Somewhat similar to Yellow-wattled Bulbul, but lacks the crest and the obvious yellow eye-ring. Voice includes a loud, pulsing “picha! picha! picha!” followed by medium-pitched warbling."
0,Zanzibar Red Bishop,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Euplectes nigroventris,https://ebird.org/species/zanbis1,"Breeding males are spectacular birds with completely black underparts and mostly orange-red upperparts. Females and non-breeding males are brown and streaky. Breeds in moist areas including marshes, flooded grassland, and cultivated areas. Non-breeding flocks are found in many open habitats, and often mix with other species. The song is long and rattling, and the typical calls are rough “tek” notes. Breeding males are easily identified by their completely black underparts. Non-breeding males and females are very similar to other bishops, but are smaller than most other bishops, and lack the prominent yellow edges to the wing feathers of Fire-fronted Bishop."
0,Zapata Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Cyanolimnas cerverai,https://ebird.org/species/zaprai1,"An extremely scarce and secretive rail of dense freshwater sawgrass savannahs with scattered tussocks. It is flightless, or nearly so. Unique in appearance with warm brown upperparts, bluish gray underparts, red legs, red eyes, and red bill with yellow tip. The similarly sized Spotted Rail is spotted above and heavily barred below unlike the Zapata Rail. An adult Common Gallinule or young Purple Gallinule are passingly similar, but the gallinules are larger, have thicker bills, and have yellow to green legs. Most rails are best detected by voice, however calls of the Zapata Rail are poorly described and may not actually pertain to this species."
0,Zapata Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Torreornis inexpectata,https://ebird.org/species/zapspa1,"A handsome species with subtle coloration. Its yellow belly shades to olive sides, and a largely gray face is topped by a rusty crown and met below by black-borded white throat. Often found in pairs low in foliage or on the ground. No similar species occur in its range. Calls include a rapid twittering “ti-ti-ti…,” a high thin, “tzi-tzi-tzi,” and a rapid series of ten or more buzzy trilling notes that descend in pitch and grow softer towards the end."
0,Zapata Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Ferminia cerverai,https://ebird.org/species/zapwre1,"A highly secretive denizen of sawgrass marshes. This small brown bird, with heavy barring above, and a somewhat long, down-curved bill has no similar species within its range. It is most often found by its song: “Tseuu-we-we-we-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu” or variations thereof. The song’s middle notes and/or end notes are sometimes buzzy and the end notes are sometimes given as a trill. Calls include a series of rapid ticks, hard buzzy chips, and a variety of harsh notes."
0,Zappey's Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyanoptila cumatilis,https://ebird.org/species/zapfly1,"Very similar to Blue-and-white Flycatcher (breeding grounds do not overlap). Females and juveniles are essentially unidentifiable while on migration unless seen with an adult male, which is radiant, electric blue above and white below, lacking the contrasting black throat and breast of Blue-and-white, instead transitioning more smoothly from blue to white. Pale gray smudging on the flanks, while more difficult to see, can also serve to differentiate the two. Song is a thrush-like series of bright, slightly slurred warbles and whistles. Breeds in submontane mixed forests in northern China; wintering grounds little-known, but presumably at a similar altitudinal range in evergreen forests."
0,Zarudny's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer zarudnyi,https://ebird.org/species/desspa4,"Small, delicate pallid sparrow. Both sexes have pale gray upperparts, a black bib, black lines in front of the eyes (lores), sandy underparts, and large white wing patches. Found in sandy arid habitats and desert scrub."
0,Zebra Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Geopelia striata,https://ebird.org/species/zebdov,"A small, grayish brown dove with dark bars on the breast and back, and bare blue skin around the eye. The call is a rapid series of short “coos,” higher pitched and faster than Spotted Dove. Native to Southeast Asia, but introduced to many islands, including the Hawaiian Islands, French Polynesia, Mauritius, and the Seychelles. It is generally quite abundant throughout both its native and non-native range, especially in urban and suburban areas; typically not found in dense forests."
0,Zebra Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Taeniopygia guttata,https://ebird.org/species/zebfin2,"Small finch with bright orange bill and a distinctive black-and-white “moustache” mark. Adult male gray above, with barred grayish bib, rusty white-spotted flanks, and black-and-white tail pattern. Female smooth gray to buff on the chest and belly; juvenile similar but with a dark gray bill. Inhabits arid inland Australia, where often found in very large flocks."
0,Zeledon's Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Hafferia zeledoni,https://ebird.org/species/zelant1,"A nondescript antbird; male entirely black and female entirely dark brown. Only notable feature is the pale blue skin around the eye on both sexes. Listen for loud song, a series of even whistled notes. Rather large and chunky. Look for the tail being raised and lowered slowly. Typically found in pairs in the dark forest understory, sometimes following a mixed flock or ant swarm."
0,Zenaida Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Zenaida aurita,https://ebird.org/species/zendov,"Local and often rather wary dove of fairly open coastal habitats, such as beach dunes with desert scrub, overgrown fields, town edges. Resembles widespread Mourning Dove of North America, but slightly stockier, with a shorter and squared tail. Feeds on the ground, but most often seen in flight, which is fast and direct, usually rather low over the treetops. Best field mark is the white trailing edge to the inner part of the wing, usually quite distinct in flight."
0,Zenker's Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Melignomon zenkeri,https://ebird.org/species/zenhon1,"An infrequently encountered honeyguide of forests and forest edge. Overall olive-green to green in coloration, with upperparts darker than underparts and the brightest green in the wings. Vent is pale with hints of streaking, and tail has white outer feathers with dark tips. Similar to Cassin’s Honeyguide, but note Zenker’s larger bill, larger size, darker throat, and dark-tipped tail. Overlaps locally with Yellow-footed Honeyguide in Cameroon, but Zenker’s Honeyguide has duskier legs and a darker throat, and where the two overlap, Zenker’s is often found at lower elevations. Vocalizations are little known, but the song apparently consists of repeated typical honeyguide “tjee” notes that slowly rise in pitch before peaking and gradually descending in pitch, given at a rate of 1-2 notes per second for up to 20 seconds."
0,Zigzag Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Zebrilus undulatus,https://ebird.org/species/zigher1,"Small, dark, rarely seen heron of forest. Plumage is entirely gray-brown with fine black vermiculations; young birds sport warmer tones. Occurs at low density in swampy forest, especially along densely vegetated riverbanks and in areas with much standing water. Stays close to cover and forages deliberately, walking slowly on the ground or ambushing prey from low perches, flicking tail continuously. May freeze or fly off awkwardly when startled. Heard more often than seen; song is a muffled hoot, repeated at long intervals, usually given before dawn or at dusk. Combination of small size, dark plumage and forest habitat should clinch identification."
0,Zimmer's Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus zimmeri,https://ebird.org/species/zimtap1,"Distinctive tapaculo of humid montane forest adjacent to treeline and Polylepis forest in the high Andes in NW Argentina and S Bolivia. Striking white throat distinctive from other tapaculos except White-browed, from which it differs by voice and gray (not brown) hind crown. Generally observed in the open more than other tapaculos, often perching on rocks and ground-level vegetation. Song a quick series two dry notes spaced out, then 3-4 quick dry notes: “pik-pik pr-tr-tr”."
0,Zimmer's Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Dendroplex kienerii,https://ebird.org/species/zimwoo2,"Medium-sized, slim woodcreeper with a longish tail and shortish bill. Note the whitish eyebrow. Has a streaked head and upper back. Breast streaks have a triangular shape and dark edges. Inhabits the interior of seasonally flooded forests and forests on river islands; forages at middle levels, often accompanying mixed-species flocks. Sings a fast trill: “tr’r’r’r’r’r’r’r’r’r’r.” The similar, commoner Straight-billed Woodcreeper has a straighter, paler, and thicker bill, shorter tail, and slower song."
0,Zino's Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma madeira,https://ebird.org/species/madpet,"Typical gadfly petrel with long, angular wings, long tail, and rapid, banking flight. Very similar to Fea's Petrel, but slightly smaller and has a smaller bill and a more rounded head. As in Fea's Petrel, underwing is mainly dark, underparts are white, and hood is gray with darker eye-surround. Upperparts gray with darker W-shape across wings and mantle. Breeds on mountaintops in Madeira only. Forages at sea."
0,Zitting Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola juncidis,https://ebird.org/species/zitcis1,"Very small, with distinctive short, rounded tail with conspicuous terminal spots. Body sandy-colored below, streaky above. Breeding males have a dark bill and crown. Found in open grasslands, meadows, and agricultural areas. Most often seen high in the sky uttering its monotonous and repetitive ""tchip…tchip….tchip…"" song in undulating song flight."
0,Zoe's Imperial-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula zoeae,https://ebird.org/species/zoeimp1,"A large pigeon of lowland and foothill forest. Pale gray head, yellow eye and short green tail. Pale pinkish breast and whiteish belly are divided by a distinctive thin, black breast band. Fairly common but not seen too often as it keeps more to the forest interior. Distinguished from all other imperial-pigeons by chest band. Its distinctive call betrays its presence. A long, muffled note followed by a series of chuckles “wooo wuhuhuhu wuhuhuhu”."
