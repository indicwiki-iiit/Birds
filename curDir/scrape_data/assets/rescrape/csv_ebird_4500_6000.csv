0,Heard Island Shag,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Leucocarbo nivalis,https://ebird.org/species/heisha1,"A large pied shag with a very white head, neck, and shoulders, a bright blue eye-ring, and a large patch of yellow warty skin in front of the eyes. Breeding adult has a wispy crest. Marine, breeding on cliffs and in tussock grassland. No other similar birds occur within its limited range. Loud barking and honking are the most common vocalizations."
0,Heermann's Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus heermanni,https://ebird.org/species/heegul,Unique smoky-gray gull with red bill. Breeding adults have a clean white head that blends seamlessly into the gray neck; nonbreeding adults have smudgy dark streaking on the head. Immatures are entirely dark brown with a yellowish or reddish bill with a dark tip. Almost exclusively coastal; usually seen in flocks loafing on beaches or feeding in nearshore waters. Breeds in Mexico mainly in the Gulf of California; migrates as far north as Washington and British Columbia in winter. Overall dark plumage of immatures might recall a dark-morph jaeger; note Heermann's lacks pale wing flashes and never shows pale mottling on the belly or underwings.
0,Heinroth's Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus heinrothi,https://ebird.org/species/heishe1,"A small, distinctively proportioned shearwater with a comparatively long-necked, long-tailed, round-winged appearance. Entirely dark plumage contrasts with variably white bars on the underside of remarkably short, stubby wings. Long thin bill is often obvious, as is this species’ habit of flying with its head raised above its body. Pale morph is paler below and overall lighter brown, but retains odd proportions. The dark morph of Wedge-tailed Shearwater is somewhat similar, but much larger and longer-tailed. Black Noddy is similar in size, but has a more buoyant, bouncy tern-like flight. Christmas Shearwater is most similar, but has a proportionally shorter bill and tail. Short-tailed and Sooty Shearwaters are similar in plumage, but their toes project beyond their tail, unlike in Heinroth’s Shearwater."
0,Hellmayr's Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus hellmayri,https://ebird.org/species/helpip1,"Uncommon pipit found in grasslands, dry rocky areas, and less frequently in low intensity agricultural habitats. It has a heavily streaked back with a white throat and pale belly. Note the lightly streaked breast and flanks. Similar to Short-billed Pipit, but lacks the white mustache and has streaky flanks. Sings a series of buzzy nasal notes perched or in flight."
0,Helmet Vanga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Euryceros prevostii,https://ebird.org/species/helvan1,"Huge black vanga with a rufous back and an enormous blue bill. Rare and localized Madagascar endemic that is found in northeastern rainforest at low and middle elevations. Usually in the mid-story, perching motionless for long periods. Often joins flocks with other large vangas. Most easily located when nesting in a large mossy cup that is placed on a forking mid-story branch. Song is a long, delicate, high-pitched, slightly descending trill."
0,Helmeted Curassow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Pauxi pauxi,https://ebird.org/species/helcur1,"Large and unmistakable black curassow with a blue-gray helmet on forehead, red bill and legs, white belly, and white tipped tail. Males and most females similar, but some females are of a brown and barred morph. Generally rare in mature montane forest from low to medium elevations. Often in pairs or small groups walking on the forest floor, foraging on fruits and seeds; when alarmed flies to the upper level of the forest, sometimes calling in alarm and other times staying quiet. Vocal during the breeding season; song is a deep, low pitched series of “uhm…UUUUHm…uuuhm;” alarm call is a deep and dry sneezing sound. No similar species in range."
0,Helmeted Friarbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Philemon buceroides,https://ebird.org/species/helfri1,"Large brownish honeyeater with bare black facial skin and a long, pointed, black bill topped by a small rounded ""horn"". Uniformly gray-brown with upperparts a darker shade than the underparts. Care should be taken to distinguish it from Silver-crowned Friarbird (which has an angular edge to the upper rear portion of the black facial skin, as well as a slightly larger ""horn"" on the bill). Also similar is the Noisy Friarbird (which has a completely bare head). Found along the tropical Queensland and Northern Territory coasts—where it can be common in a variety of habitats including parks, gardens, mangroves, and forests. The ""Sandstone"" subspecies in Arnhem Land is quite different in habitat; it occurs in inland sandstone areas. Typically very loud, with has a variety of harsh, loud squawks, including the ""poor devil"" call."
0,Helmeted Guineafowl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Numididae,Numida meleagris,https://ebird.org/species/helgui,"A large-bodied, small-headed, slaty-gray gamebird perfectly lined with rows of hundreds of white spots. The distinctive head sports a strange bone-like casque and naked warty facial skin, which is colored white, blue, or red depending on geographic location. Young birds are brown and are almost always found with adults. It is common throughout its range, and large flocks roam the savannas, digging for invertebrates and tubers. Guineafowl often behave like lunatics, charging around issuing a loud and distinctive “kek-kek-kek-kraaaaaaah” alarm. It also calls a distinctive, plaintive “kuuuh-keeerk”. Crested Guineafowl differ from Helmeted Guineafowl by being darker and having a plumed crest on top of the head."
0,Helmeted Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Buceros vigil,https://ebird.org/species/helhor1,"Bizarre-looking bird, now very rare due to poaching for the ivory-like material of its bill. When perched, its most recognizable feature is the naked throat pouch which resembles an undercooked steak, chalky white in the female and dull scarlet in the male. When in flight, its long trailing central tail feathers easily distinguish it from any other hornbill. Scarce and difficult to see; listen for its far-carrying maniacal laugh in mature lowland and foothill forests."
0,Helmeted Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Antilophia galeata,https://ebird.org/species/helman1,"Males are striking with a mostly glossy black body, but with a red forehead, crest, and back. Females are uniformly olive-green and also crested. Locally common in gallery forests embedded in savannas where it often accompanies mixed-species flocks. The song is a trilling series of alternately soft and loud whistles."
0,Helmeted Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Basilornis galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/helmyn1,"A glossy-black starling with a big permanently raised crest that gives it a unique, broad-headed profile. Also note prominent whitish markings on sides of neck and breast, which appear like one large patch. Juvenile shorter-crested, with a brown chin and a bicolored bill. Frequents the canopy of lowland and hill forest in small groups or pairs, preferring pristine areas, but straying into edges and degraded patches too. Complex song involves whirring “weee-ow-weee-ow” mixed with “chur” and “chip” notes. Also gives a single, strident metallic “chip” call."
0,Helmeted Pygmy-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Lophotriccus galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/heptyr1,"Tiny flycatcher; common and widespread, but heard far more often than seen. When seen well, note pale eye and elongated crown feathers, giving this bird a hammer-headed appearance. Found in humid forest understory and second-growth as well as in savanna woodland. Frequently found near gaps and vine tangles where it sits quietly, then sallies upward to glean insects from leaves. Song is an irregular series of ticking notes that sometimes runs into a trill, often given for long periods throughout the day. Similar to Double-banded Pygmy-Tyrant, but vocalizations are less buzzy."
0,Helmeted Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Celeus galeatus,https://ebird.org/species/helwoo1,"Fairly large woodpecker. A usually rare inhabitant of extensive humid forests. Note cinnamon face, red head with a prominent crest, and white stripes on the side of the neck. Solid black back and wings, and heavily barred below with a pale rump. Males have a red moustache. A mimic of the much larger Robust Woodpecker."
0,Hemprich's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Lophoceros hemprichii,https://ebird.org/species/hemhor1,"A medium-sized dark-brown hornbill with a long tail. The bill is dull reddish and the belly white; there is white in the outer tail. The flight is floppy and loose. Found in dry savanna habitats, particularly on and around cliffs and other rocky microhabitats. Similar to Crowned Hornbill, but darker, with a duller bill and more white in the tail. The call starts with “keeya” notes, then usually progresses into a rapid piping."
0,Hen Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus cyaneus,https://ebird.org/species/norhar1,"Medium-sized harrier, flies with wings held in a V-shape, low over open fields and marshes, listening for rodents lurking below. Distinctive foraging behavior and conspicuous white patch on rump in all plumages. Five long primary ‘finger tips’ prominent in flight. Females and immatures are warm brown with streaky breasts. Adult male has plain mid-gray wings with black wingtips and paler belly."
0,Henderson Island Crake,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Zapornia atra,https://ebird.org/species/heicra1,"An entirely deep black crake with bright reddish-orange eye-ring and legs. Bill is yellowish green. Flightless, bold, and curious. No other similar birds occur within its range. Contact call is a nasal “kak” repeated rapidly. Also gives a loud, continuous churring call."
0,Henderson Island Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus insularis,https://ebird.org/species/hifdov1,"Relatively subdued in coloration for a fruit-dove. Has a dusky gray chest and face, a yellow eye-ring, a magenta forehead patch, and mostly green wings and body. An adaptable species found at all elevations. Shares its range with no similar species. Call is typically a long series of “woot” notes, well spaced and gradually descending in pitch."
0,Henderson Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma atrata,https://ebird.org/species/henpet1,"A typical uniformly grayish-brown petrel with pale mottling at the base of the bill that gives it a somewhat “frosted” facial appearance. Pale bar along the leading edge of the underwing between the body and elbow is evident in flight. Highly pelagic, visiting land only to nest. Similar to Kermadec Petrel, but lacks the white primary shafts in the upperwing of that species and is overall more uniformly colored. Providence Petrel is similar but appears much heavier-chested and paler-faced, with more extensively mottled gray-brown tones across the body. Herald Petrel is very similar, but has much more contrasting dark-and-light underwing pattern. Henderson Petrel is silent at sea."
0,Henderson Island Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus taiti,https://ebird.org/species/hirwar1,"A large warbler with a variably white head and body. Crown and uppersides often mottled olive-brown and white, underside often tinted yellow. Wing feathers and tail darker. Found in undisturbed forest. Common call is a high-pitched single note. Not known to sing."
0,Henslow's Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passerellidae,Centronyx henslowii,https://ebird.org/species/henspa,"A large-headed and thick-billed sparrow, found exclusively in weedy grasslands with sparse shrubs. Distinctive color combination of olive-green nape, rufous wings, and crisp black streaks below. Also note large pinkish bill and flat crown. Singing males perch conspicuously in the breeding season; otherwise very secretive, especially in migration and winter. Populations declining sharply, perhaps due to pesticide use and destruction of native grasslands. Listen for its extremely short song, easy to pass off as an insect: “ts-lick.”"
0,Henst's Goshawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter henstii,https://ebird.org/species/hengos1,"A big, powerful goshawk. Adults are gray on the back with fine gray barring below; females much larger. Immatures have a brown back and thick streaks below. Endemic to Madagascar, where it is a scarce resident of all types of primary forest. Rarely sits in the open, and only occasionally soars. Territorial call is a loud repeated “khew” which is often given in flight. Males can be very hard to separate from similarly-sized female Madagascar Sparrowhawk. On Henst’s, look for fine bars on the undertail, a completely barred throat, and a central toe of normal length. Immatures may only be separable based on toe length. Also very similar to the rare Madagascar Serpent-Eagle. Subtle differences include slightly smaller size, evenly-spaced barring on the chest, thicker black bands on the tail, and an unbarred back."

0,Hepatic Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cardinalidae,Piranga flava,https://ebird.org/species/heptan,"Large, stocky tanager. Males are red with dusty wash on upperparts and sides (especially on northern populations); females are muted yellowish. Both sexes are brightest on the throat and crown. Also note stout bill and dark lores. Several separate populations occur from the southwestern U.S. to South America, probably comprising multiple different species. Northern birds prefer mountainous areas with mixed pine-oak forest. South American birds found in a variety of forested habitats, from open woodlands in the lowlands to scrubby areas in the high Andes. Most similar to Summer Tanager, but grayer tones to plumage and usually different habitat. Song is sweet like American Robin: mostly clear phrases with some hoarser notes."
0,Herald Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma heraldica,https://ebird.org/species/herpet2,"Medium-sized, lightly built petrel of offshore tropical waters across the Pacific; not seen from mainland. Plumage is highly variable (from white-bodied and dark-headed to wholly dark) and often very similar to larger and broader-winged Kermadec Petrel, which has a shorter and broader tail than Herald. Herald has white flashes on underside of wingtips, but lacks white shafts on upperside, which are diagnostic of Kermadec. Both species visit colonies in daytime, when pairs chase around high overhead."
0,Herero Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Melaenornis herero,https://ebird.org/species/hercha1,"Brown chat with a dark face mask, a pale eyebrow, and very faint streaking on the underparts. Found very locally in a specific microhabitat: the bands of somewhat lusher woodland around the base of rocky escarpments at the edge of the Namib Desert. Usually in pairs. Quiet but distinctive song is a four-note series of mournful whistles. Fairly similar to Familiar Chat, but easily separated by bold face pattern."
0,Hermit Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Catharus guttatus,https://ebird.org/species/herthr,"Medium brown above with contrasting reddish tail. Dark spots on breast do not continue all the way down belly like Wood Thrush. Found in wooded areas; often hops on the ground or skulks in dense patches of shrubbery. Winters further north than other thrushes; many stay in the U.S. Listen for its beautiful song that is higher pitched than other thrushes with a steady introductory note; also gives low ""chup"" call note."
0,Hermit Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga occidentalis,https://ebird.org/species/herwar,"Yellow-faced warbler of western coniferous forests. Males are almost entirely yellow-headed with black nape and throat, gray upperparts with white wingbars, and whitish underparts. Females much duller with pale throat and dingy gray belly, and always show a blank yellow face (some with faint olive cheek patch). Hybridizes with Townsend's Warbler where ranges overlap. Favors conifers on breeding and wintering grounds. Migrants found in a variety of wooded habitats. Feeds on insects, often high in treetops."
0,Hermit Wood-Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Henicorhina anachoreta,https://ebird.org/species/gybwow3,"Small, short-tailed wren endemic to the Santa Marta Mountains of Colombia. It has a white eyebrow and streaky face, though plumage is almost identical to that of Gray-breasted Wood-Wren. It can be identified by its faster, squeakier, and higher-pitched song, and it generally occurs at higher elevations with little overlap. Usually found in pairs that stay low in cloud forest understory. Quite common in the upper parts of El Dorado Nature Reserve, but not found near the lodge."
0,Heuglin's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Neotis heuglinii,https://ebird.org/species/heubus1,"A fairly large and lanky bustard. Males have a mostly black face, females a striped face. Both sexes have a gray neck and white belly. In flight, the wing is pale brown and black above and mostly pale below. A generally scarce species that is found in dry savanna, scrub, and other semi-desert habitats. Often in pairs. Similar to White-bellied Bustard, but the male is distinguished by his dark rather than pinkish bill, and the female by her gray rather than brownish neck."
0,Heuglin's Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus heuglini,https://ebird.org/species/hemwea1,"A small, yellow-eyed masked-weaver with a plain green back. The breeding male has a black face mask extending to a point on the upper breast, without a chestnut wash around the mask. Female and juvenile are duller, with a buff wash on the breast and a lightly streaked back. A fairly common resident throughout open savanna and semi-arid areas, often nesting colonially near ant and wasp nests. Many similar-looking weavers do not overlap in range with Heuglin’s: the larger Village and Vitelline Masked-Weavers have red eyes, and Lesser Masked-Weaver has a black (not yellow) forehead."
0,Heuglin's Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe heuglini,https://ebird.org/species/heuwhe1,"A brownish wheatear with a rusty breast. Note the white eyebrow, dark mask, and pale throat. The tail is mostly black with a white base and rump, forming a thick “T” pattern that is conspicuous in flight. Found in short grassland, cultivated areas, and open savanna, often in rocky areas. Very similar to Red-breasted Wheater, but there is little overlap in range, and Heuglin’s is smaller and darker, with a duller pale throat. The song is a long, complex mix of many different components, sometimes given in a flight display."
0,Highland Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia obscura,https://ebird.org/species/higela2,"Medium-sized flycatcher with a small head and long tail. Found in forests and second growth. Largely olive above with a light gray throat and flanks, and a yellow center to the belly. Note two pale wingbars."
0,Highland Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelopina nigra,https://ebird.org/species/higgua1,"Large, long-tailed game bird of humid evergreen forest in highlands and foothills. Mostly seen high in trees, as singles or pairs, where they can move quickly and slip away easily from view. Male is glossy black with bright red throat wattle and red legs (lacks whitish streaking on breast of the much larger Crested Guan). Female is barred brown and blackish overall. In spring, the male gives a piercing upslurred whistle, which it often alternates with an amazing crackling and crashing rattle in a gliding display flight."
0,Highland Rush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus centralis,https://ebird.org/species/hirwar2,"A nondescript long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Rusty-brown overall with blurry streaking on the breast. Found in wetland habitat, primarily reedbeds. Extremely secretive and skulking. Most often seen when it sits up to sing or gives a short display flight. Song starts with slow, hesitant, buzzy metallic notes that speed up, then ends with a trill made by beating the wings together at incredible speed. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed-warblers and swamp-warblers. Very similar to Little Rush Warbler, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Highland sings a much higher-pitched song."
0,Highland Tinamou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothocercus bonapartei,https://ebird.org/species/higtin1,"Rotund chickenlike bird, far more often heard than seen. Like a dove but body is even more circular and tail shorter. Most similar to Great Tinamou but generally found at higher elevations; also warmer rufous-brown below with small buffy spots on back and grayer head. Lives on the ground in montane forests. Shy and difficult to see; most often seen running away along a trail. Listen for series of repeated nasal call notes."
0,Hildebrandt's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Lamprotornis hildebrandti,https://ebird.org/species/hilsta1,"A beautiful starling of savanna country. The upperparts are iridescent, with a purple sheen on the head and green on most of the wing. Also note the orange underparts and eye. Found in moderately moist savanna and woodland, often in small flocks, sometimes with other species of starlings. Similar to Superb Starling, but doesn’t have a white chest band, underwing patch, or vent, and the eye is orange rather than whitish. Also similar to Shelley’s Starling, but slightly larger and paler overall, with a paler rufous belly and a more contrasting green wing. The common call is a raspy “cherrcherrcherr” that is incorporated into the rambling song."
0,Hill Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis whitei,https://ebird.org/species/hibfly1,"Medium-sized confusing flycatcher. Male is beautifully colored, with deep blue upperparts, orange throat and breast, and white belly. Note dark face and electric blue highlight on the forehead. Female is duller. Very similar to closely-related Large Blue Flycatcher: note marginally smaller bill without a noticeable hooked tip, less contrastingly pale throat, and darker legs. Male Hill Blue Flycatcher has more orange on the throat and a dark blue rump. Breeds in hilly and montane broadleaf thickets, often in areas with dense undergrowth; migratory birds winter at lower altitudes. Song mixes melodious warbling and whistling notes with harsh, rasping ones. Calls are a loud “chak” or “tak,” reminiscent of stones tapping."
0,Hill Partridge,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Arborophila torqueola,https://ebird.org/species/hilpar1,"A brightly-colored game bird with an intricate head pattern and a body shaped like a football. Brick-red on the crown serves to distinguish the male from the similar Rufous-throated Partridge, while male Hill Partridge also lacks orange on the throat. Female lacks the male's white chest band and brick-red crown and has less orange on the throat than Rufous-throated. Moves around in convoys through dense vegetation in mid- to high-altitude forests."
0,Hill Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba rupestris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpig1,"Very similar in appearance to the wild-type Rock Pigeon, this flocking species inhabits open valleys and gorges also visits towns and cities. More pale-headed than Rock Pigeon, but the key distinguishing trait is a broad white stripe across its dark tail which is visible both in flight and when perched; the wild-type Rock Pigeon has a dark-tipped gray tail with no white. Forages on the ground in large flocks; can be quite tame and accommodating towards human presence."
0,Hill Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/hilpri2,"A large, fierce-eyed prinia with a long, oft-cocked tail. Breeding adults have a gray head, white throat and brow, brown upperparts, and pale, brown-washed underparts. Nonbreeding adults lack the gray but retain the white brow and throat. May be confused at a distance with Yellow-bellied Prinia, but is much larger, and has a more extensive brow and no bright yellow anywhere on the body. Usually found in open, scrubby habitats, including overgrown fields and forest edges. Loud, strident song consists of one high liquid-sounding note being repeated over and over."
0,Hill Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Hirundo domicola,https://ebird.org/species/pacswa3,"A small dark blue-black swallow with rufous-chestnut on its face and a short tail. Except for a black triangular eye-stripe extending to the bill, the entire forehead, chin, throat, and upper breast are rufous-chestnut, without any dark necklace like that of Barn Swallow, the main confusion species. Hill Swallow’s dark upperparts have a blue-green sheen that is only visible when seen up close, while the underparts are dingy white with ashy-gray on the flanks. Juveniles have duller chestnut on the face. Mainly inhabits open areas such as grasslands, reservoirs, and tea estates in the high hills above 500 meters of elevation; very rare at lower elevations. Often seen wheeling and looping in the air after insects, with a swift flight action reminiscent of a Barn Swallow with a shorter tail."
0,Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Carpodacus pulcherrimus,https://ebird.org/species/bearos1,"A rather dark and heavily marked rosefinch. Male is dark rosy-pink below and dark, streaky brown above with a dark pink brow. Female is brown and streaky with underparts streaking extending from the throat (where the streaks are extremely fine) to the belly (where the streaks are heavier and longer). Females also have a faint pale brow, but it is weak and not always noticeable; note the far more contrasting brow of Chinese and Himalayan White-browed Rosefinches. Inhabits montane and hilly scrub, forest edges, and village outskirts. Gives twitters and trills. The extremely similar Chinese Beautiful Rosefinch gives sharper and more metallic call notes than the Himalayan Beautiful Rosefinch."
0,Himalayan Bluetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Tarsiger rufilatus,https://ebird.org/species/himblu1,"Brightly-colored adult male is unmistakable in range: blazing sapphire blue with orange flanks and white throat and belly. Female is brown with a white throat, orange flanks, and pale blue rump and tail. Red-flanked Bluetail can be confusing where the two overlap in the latter’s migratory and winter range; note Himalayan’s brighter blue eyebrow and brighter, deeper blue upperparts in the male. Female is slightly more grayish than Red-flanked, but this identification can be much more difficult, and females may not be safely separable if not with male. Himalayan’s song is a simple, repeated “tcher-thcew-wee!”. Breeds in submontane forest up to the treeline; descends in the winter, often moving into edge habitats. A frequent sight along forest tracks."
0,Himalayan Bulbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Pycnonotus leucogenys,https://ebird.org/species/whcbul2,"Sharp-looking bulbul with a spiffy mohawk. Note black face and throat, bright white cheek spot, and yellow vent. A species of foothill and montane forested areas; also found in brush, gardens, and towns. Tame and unafraid of people. Typically in pairs or small flocks during the breeding season; congregates in large flocks at other times. Song is a short and rather nasal-sounding burst of gurgling warbles. Calls include dry raspings, chups, and squeaks."
0,Himalayan Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo refectus,https://ebird.org/species/combuz9,"A large hawk with a confusing range and unclear identification criteria. Resident in the Himalayas and a breeder in adjacent areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A large “typical” buzzard, brown overall with blotchy patterning on the breast, dark upper “trousers,” and dark “elbows” and trailing edge on the underwing. Juvenile streakier below with a more finely barred tail and paler trailing edge. Compare with extremely similar Upland and Eastern Buzzards; note less eagle-like proportions than Upland, as well as marginally darker “trousers” and more prominent trailing edge than Eastern."
0,Himalayan Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Cuculus saturatus,https://ebird.org/species/himcuc1,"Visually indistinguishable from Oriental Cuckoo. Adult male is gray above with a black-and-white-barred belly and a dark gray tail; females usually look similar, but some (known as hepatic morph birds) have cinnamon-brown upperparts with black barring throughout. Intermediate in size between Common and Lesser Cuckoos; distinguished from both species by buffy (not white) under-tail feathers and from Lesser Cuckoos by yellow iris. Song is a series of five notes, with the leading note being sharper and more distinct than the four that follow; compare with Oriental Cuckoo’s series of mellow paired notes. Breeds in a wide range of different lowland and hill forests; also more open habitats outside of breeding season."
0,Himalayan Cutia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Cutia nipalensis,https://ebird.org/species/cutia1,"A beautiful, stocky inhabitant of high-elevation broadleaf and mixed forests. Looks like a babbler, but much more closely related to laughingthrushes. Male has a black mask, blue-gray crown, white throat, barred sides, and bright rufous back. Female is paler, with a brown face and a more yellowish back lined with black streaks. Forages at middle and upper levels, often in small groups, picking invertebrates from leaf clusters, ferns and orchids, and mossy crevices of trunks and branches. Listen for its loud song, an extended series of high-pitched, piercing “chee!” notes."
0,Himalayan Flameback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dinopium shorii,https://ebird.org/species/himfla1,"A large woodpecker with a brilliant orange back, a black stripe through the eye and cheek, and black on the back of the neck. Inhabits mature lowland forest. It looks for invertebrates in trees, meticulously working its way up from the base of the trunk. Not shy; often mixes with other species, especially babblers and laughingthrushes. Very similar to Common Flameback, but the Himalayan Flameback has a longer bill and the cheek stripe splits into two near the bill. The call is a tinny, nasal series of notes similar to those of other flamebacks."
0,Himalayan Monal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophophorus impejanus,https://ebird.org/species/himmon1,"Decked out in all the colors of the rainbow, the male is the image of iridescence; green crested head, red neck, green shoulders, blue back, orange tail, and black underparts. When displaying or flushed, flashes a bright white patch on the back. Female is nowhere near as brightly-colored, with a pale blue eye patch, white throat, and streaky brown body. Found in Himalayan hill forest, typically in areas with extensive rhododendron and bamboo-dominated understory."
0,Himalayan Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix nivicolum,https://ebird.org/species/himowl1,"A medium-sized brownish owl of montane forests, generally uncommon. Brownish overall with finely patterned underparts. Deep black eyes bracketed by bright white arcs impart a learned, severe expression. Asian counterpart to Europe's Tawny Owl. Calls loudly and slowly, a repeated pair of hoots."
0,Himalayan Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia crinigera,https://ebird.org/species/strpri2,"A rather dull-plumaged songbird of fields, grasslands, forest edges, and farmland, mostly at moderate and high elevations. Often sparsely distributed and difficult to find. Gray-brown above with a pale belly and blackish streaking on head and wings. Breeding males become black-billed and darker on the face, losing the pale eyebrow that is usually shown in other plumages. Typically found singly or in pairs, clambering about in grasses and shrubbery. Often sings from an exposed perch, giving a loud but dry, rolling series of notes, slower than the song of Striped Prinia. Visually very similar to Striped Prinia, but usually separated by range. In the area of overlap, female and non-breeding male Himalayan Prinias show weaker streaking on the back and a duller rufous panel in the wings. Breeding males are distinguished by their darker faces without an eye-stripe. Also similar to Burmese Prinia, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Himalayan Prinia is distinguished by having more streaking, especially along the sides of the breast."
0,Himalayan Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Ophrysia superciliosa,https://ebird.org/species/himqua1,"Extinct, last reported in 1876. Formerly west central Himalayas."
0,Himalayan Rubythroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Calliope pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/himrub1,"Shy inhabitant of thickets and dense grassy areas from subalpine scrub to above treeline. Male is gunmetal gray with a white brow, bright orange throat, and a black patch extending from the face down to the breast. Very similar to the closely related Chinese Rubythroat, which has a white moustachial stripe. Chinese Rubythroat female averages browner than female Himalayan, but is best identified by range; Chinese breeds in central and south-central China, while Himalayan breeds along the Himalayas, in Xinjiang, and in Central Asia. Female Himalayan has a weaker eyebrow than female Siberian Rubythroat, and is darker overall."
0,Himalayan Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx cruralis,https://ebird.org/species/whbsho4,"Tiny, stumpy bird of dense undergrowth. Male is dark slate-blue with broad white eyebrows that give him the appearance of a furious little old man. Female is warm pale brown all over. In areas of overlap with Chinese and Lesser Shortwings, look out for the all-dark lower belly, which is white in those species. Inhabits hill and montane forest, where it forages in dense undergrowth, frequently in proximity to streams. Song is composed of high thin whistles with short bursts of clicking chattering mixed in."
0,Himalayan Snowcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tetraogallus himalayensis,https://ebird.org/species/himsno,"A hulking game bird of rocky mountain slopes and cliffsides. Native to the Himalayas and adjacent mountain ranges, but has also been introduced in the Ruby Mountains of Nevada.

The exact pattern and coloration are extremely variable. The underparts can be mostly black with white scaling, or mostly white with dark scaling. There is often rufous on the rump and undertail, and sometimes elsewhere. Found very locally at middle elevations in central Kenya, in thickets, remnant natural forest, and scrub dominated by exotic species. Almost always in small groups, which feed by hopping across the ground. Easily separated from other babblers in its range by the abundant and variable scaling. Usually located by the raspy babbling call, typically given by a whole group in chorus."
0,Hispaniolan Crossbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Loxia megaplaga,https://ebird.org/species/hiscro,"A gregarious species of montane pine forests. This species can be deceptively hard to find when not calling, despite its bright colors and tendency to travel in flocks of up to twenty. Note that the namesake crossed bill can be hard to see. Males are clothed in red and bear bright white wingbars. The dull yellow-olive female can be separated from other species by its bold white wingbars and structure: the bill is stout and the tail is short and notched. Call is loud “djit, djit.” Its song is a soft series of warblings and trills."
0,Hispaniolan Emerald,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Riccordia swainsonii,https://ebird.org/species/hiseme1,"An inhabitant of moist montane woodlands including coffee plantations. The long-tailed male is distinctively entirely iridescent green and the base of the bill is red. The female is metallic green above, dingy white below, and has a relatively long, forked tail. The Antillean Mango is shorter tailed (wings just about even with tail tip when perched) and has a distinctly down-curved bill. The Vervain Hummingbird is much smaller and shorter billed than the Hispaniolan Emerald. Most common vocalization is a sharp “tic,” most often given in a prolonged series at about five “tics” per second."
0,Hispaniolan Lizard-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus longirostris,https://ebird.org/species/hislic1,"An impressive long-tailed species of wooded habitats including shade coffee plantations. Typically found foraging in dense vegetation from understory to canopy; can be found sunning in the open at first light with its tail spread. Note this species long straight narrow bill, brilliant red eyering, gray chest, and buff-orange belly. The Bay-breasted Cuckoo is similarly shaped but is larger with a maroon chest and short curved bill. The Mangrove Cuckoo is smaller with a smaller curved bill and a black mask. Secretive, but not shy, this species is often first detected by its voice: a long, rapid, ratcheting “keh-keh-keh…” Also gives a low “craaa” and a sharp “chek.”"
0,Hispaniolan Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus dominicensis,https://ebird.org/species/graori1,"A sleek forest bird that sometimes ventures into gardens and parks in search of flowers and fruit; prefers areas with palms. The adult is distinctive—clothed in black except for patches of yellow on lower belly, shoulders, and rump. No similar species occur within its range. Immatures are muddled yellow, orange, and olive, developing adult plumage over the course of a year. This plumage resembles that of female and young Baltimore Orioles, a scarce migrant and winter visitor to Hispaniola. Similarly attired Baltimore Orioles can be distinguished by their orange underparts and white wingbars. The song is a rapid jumble of squeaky and metallic notes. Calls include a buzzy “jrrrt” and a metallic “zhwee.”"
0,Hispaniolan Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Psittacara chloropterus,https://ebird.org/species/hispar,"A sleek, medium-large, gregarious species of woodlands that sometimes ventures into agricultural and urban areas. Its overall green plumage, long, pointed tail, and stout bill eliminate all other species in range. In overflight, it often appears green with a red slash on each forewing. Most common call is a series of squeaks that takes on a twittering quality when given by an excited flock."
0,Hispaniolan Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus hispaniolensis,https://ebird.org/species/hispew1,"A small drab inhabitant of woodlands including orchards and coffee plantations; typically “flycatches” from a low perch and returns to the same perch. This species is perhaps most notable in its lack of field marks, including lack of wingbars and facial markings. The Stolid Flycatcher is much larger and has wingbars and the Greater Antillean Elaenia has bold wingbars and a dull eyering. Rather unvocal for a pewee; most common call is a repeated mellow “pip”."
0,Hispaniolan Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes striatus,https://ebird.org/species/hiswoo1,"A noisy and gregarious woodpecker that inhabits most wooded habitats.

Both sexes have dappled lichen-like plumage, the male grayish, female rusty brown. Silent birds are best distinguished from other small frogmouths by range, habitat, elevation, and bird’s comparatively small size. Song a long, haunting whistle, given repeatedly in series."
0,Hodgson's Redstart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Phoenicurus hodgsoni,https://ebird.org/species/hodred1,"Male very similar in appearance to Daurian Redstart; note more restricted silver on the forehead and less distinct wing panel. Female’s lack of a white wing patch distinguishes her from female Daurian, and she averages paler than female Black Redstart, with a brighter eye-ring. Blue-fronted Redstart female can be similar; Hodgson’s female is colder-toned with a single dark stripe down the tail instead of Blue-fronted’s inverted “T.” Hodgson’s breeds in hilly and montane open forests and forest edge; descends in the winter, favoring scrubby edge."

The Red-necked Parrot, the only other native species within its range, can be readily separated from the Imperial Parrot by its largely green plumage and the red (not purple) patch on its throat. Most common call is a yelping ""weep"", also gives a loud, scratchy “eee-er.”"
0,Imperial Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago imperialis,https://ebird.org/species/impsni1,"Hulking snipe of high-elevation elfin forest in the Andes. Large with a thick, drooping bill. Upperparts are black with bold cinnamon scaling; underparts are buff with black scaling, becoming paler on belly. It is larger, bulkier, and more brightly-colored than other high-Andean snipe. Shy and rarely seen; most likely encountered in dim, misty conditions when it may venture out onto a quiet trail. At display sites, birds fly overhead giving low, grating calls followed by a mechanical humming sound."
0,Inaccessible Island Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Nesospiza acunhae,https://ebird.org/species/nigfin1,"A highly variable finch with three distinct forms in the process of diversifying. The massive large-billed form is known as “Dunn’s Finch”; the two smaller forms with petite bills are a drab olive lowland form (Lowland Finch) and a bright yellow highland form (Highland Finch). Females of all forms are smaller, duller, and more streaked than males. Endemic to Inaccessible Island, where it is the only finch. Lowland form prefers grassy coast and cliffs, highland form prefers the plateau, and Dunn’s form prefers taller fruit-bearing woodland. In all forms, male sings a 3-note “whit-it-teeu” and the female whistles; Dunn’s form sounds deeper and slower than the others."
0,Inaccessible Island Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Atlantisia rogersi,https://ebird.org/species/inirai1,"A tiny, mouse-like flightless rail restricted to Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha group. The sooty adult has a brown back, a white-barred belly and flanks, and a reddish eye. Duller juvenile is paler and lacks barring. Prefers dense cover like tussock and thickets. Vocal, giving a strident trill to proclaim its territory, as well as a short “tchick” and other hard notes."
0,Inagua Woodstar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Nesophlox lyrura,https://ebird.org/species/inawoo2,"A small, long-tailed hummingbird of wooded and scrubby habitats including gardens; most often found feeding on flowers or at hummingbird feeders. Note the male’s iridescent purple throat and forehead plus its long, forked tail. On females, note the orange sides and tail edges. This species is unique within its range. Calls include a sharp, metallic “tit” or “tit-it”; often given in a series, sometimes quite rapidly. Males also make a metallic sound with their tail during display flights."
0,Inambari Gnatcatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Polioptilidae,Polioptila attenboroughi,https://ebird.org/species/inagna1,"Recently described, inconspicuous and rarely seen bird of rainforest canopy. Small and slender with a long tail; mostly dark gray with a broken white eyering, white belly, and white outer tail feathers. Inhabits canopy of tall forest, especially in regions with sandy soils. Usually seen with mixed-species flocks as it forages actively in outer foliage, sallying for insects and gleaning from leaves, moving long tail from side to side like other gnatcatchers. Thin and indistinct call notes are easily overlooked among calls of other species in flocks, but distinctive shape, active behavior, and long tail with extensive white should clinch identification. Extremely similar to other gnatcatchers of the Guianan Gnatcatcher complex, but no overlap in range. Distinguished from Tropical Gnatcatcher by uniform gray body plumage and lack of a black cap, and from Tooth-billed Wren by slimmer shape and smaller size, lacking any black barring in the plumage."
0,Inambari Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Lepidocolaptes fatimalimae,https://ebird.org/species/inawoo1,"Fairly small woodcreeper with a thin, slightly downcurved bill. Extensive streaking on the undersides but almost no streaking on the head or back; when viewed from the back, appears very plain. Olive-brown back and head, often noticeably slightly greener than the rest of the bird. Found mostly in secondary forest, with tall trees and a dense understory. Its song is a descending series of fast whistles, recalling the longer song of White-browed Antbird, or for some, the call of Downy Woodpecker."
0,Inca Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columbina inca,https://ebird.org/species/incdov,"Essentially a ground dove with a long tail. Pale sandy color with scaly pattern covering entire body, unlike Common Ground Dove. Look for obvious white outer tail feathers and rufous wings in flight. Fairly common from the southwestern U.S. to far western Panama. Found in pairs or small groups in neighborhoods, parks, and scrubby desert habitats. Listen for repeated soft whistled song, sounding like “no hope.” Whirring wingbeats sound almost like a rattlesnake when it takes off."
0,Inca Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Leptopogon taczanowskii,https://ebird.org/species/incfly1,"Fairly small flycatcher that perches upright in the mid-story of montane forest and cloud forest. Subtly colorful, with a diffuse gray facial pattern. Look for the warm buffy orange wash on the breast and faint orange wingbars. Warmer orange coloration and lack of a gray crown or strong facial pattern help distinguish it from the similar Slaty-capped Flycatcher, which it replaces at higher elevations. Forages singly or in pairs, occasionally joining mixed-species flocks; has the unusual habit of quickly raising one wing at a time behind its back."
0,Inca Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larosterna inca,https://ebird.org/species/incter1,"Beautiful and distinctive dark tern of the Humboldt Current. Found along rocky coasts and at harbors and piers where it is often confiding; less often found at sandy beaches and river mouths. Feeds over coastal and inshore waters, dipping to pick food from near surface rather than plunge-diving like typical terns. All plumages dark overall with narrow white trailing edge to wings. Adult has red bill and legs, yellow gape patch, and curling ‘Salvador Dali’ whisker. 1st-year browner overall with dark bill and legs, soon develops vestige of white whisker."

Male shows bright white patches near the wingtips and on the tail-tips in flight. Found in a range of wooded habitats, from hilly dry forest to garden edges. Listen for its distinctive song, an accelerating knocking akin to a ping-pong ball dropping and bouncing rapidly on the floor."
0,Indian Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta castanea,https://ebird.org/species/chbnut2,"Only nuthatch in most of its range with gray upperparts and brick-red underparts. From crown to upper mantle, the gray is a lighter shade than the remainder of the upperparts. Strong dark eye-stripe starts from the bill, broadening toward the sides of the neck, contrasting with the white throat. Female is similar but has lighter chestnut underparts and dirty white on the throat. In a narrow zone where it overlaps with the very similar Chestnut-bellied Nuthatch, Indian differs in the contrastingly paler crown and nape, the smaller bill, and the lack of white scallops on the vent. Primarily seen in deciduous forests; occurs in pairs or family groups, sometimes along with Velvet-fronted Nuthatches, with which it broadly overlaps in range. Call is a loud, mellow, rapid trill of 7-8 notes: “pi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi.”"
0,Indian Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone paradisi,https://ebird.org/species/aspfly1,"A graceful looking flycatcher, the adult male sport a long ribbonlike tail. The males occur in two color morphs cinnamon and white. Both color morphs sport a glossy black head with blue ring around the eye, but white morph is entirely white below while the cinnamon morph has cinnamon upperparts and tail, and dirty white underparts. The females are cinnamon above with a grayish throat, a shorter tail, and they lack the male’s blue eyering. They make short aerial sallies after insects, usually returning to the same perch. Occasionally descends to ground to pull apart insects. Chiefly found in wooded habitats. Their call is a harsh “shreew.”"
0,Indian Peafowl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Pavo cristatus,https://ebird.org/species/compea,"An unmistakable, large ground bird. The unmistakable iridescent blue male spreads out its ornamental upper tail feathers when courting females. Females have a shorter tail, an iridescent green neck, and browner plumage.

0,Indian Pond-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola grayii,https://ebird.org/species/inpher1,"A small heron that is common in most aquatic habitats across the Indian subcontinent. Adults in breeding plumage have a dark reddish brown back that contrasts with a yellowish head, neck, and breast. In nonbreeding plumage they are virtually indistinguishable from nonbreeding Chinese Pond-Heron. In flight, adults appear surprisingly white due to their strikingly white wings, underparts, and tail. Although typically solitary, large numbers often gather where food is plentiful. Prone to seasonally local movements and vagrancy."
0,Indian Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Copsychus fulicatus,https://ebird.org/species/indrob1,"A nondescript robin; males are primarily black with chestnut bottom feathers, although males in the northern population have brownish upperparts.

0,Iraq Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Argya altirostris,https://ebird.org/species/irabab1,"Small babbler with a long tail and short wings, typical of other babblers. Warm buff overall with a pale throat and a lightly streaked back and crown. Moves around in reedbeds in noisy flocks. Vocalizations include a high-pitched ""pi-pi-pi-pi-pi…"" and explosive ""pit! pit!"""
0,Iringa Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia lowei,https://ebird.org/species/iriaka1,"A rather small, demure understory denizen resembling a cross between a robin and a flycatcher. Mostly dull brown with a buffy throat and a short eyebrow. Juvenile is more mottled. A highly local bird found singly and in pairs in dry and wet primary and secondary montane forest in a narrow range along the Udzungwa and Livingstone mountains escarpment between 1350 and 2500 meters of elevation. Sits for long periods, sallying to catch insect prey, or forages on the ground, often in the company of ants and other ant-following birds. Sings a variable medley of quavering high-pitched notes, “tseet-teet-tsereet-teeet-tsureet,” that is sweet without being tuneful. Calls include an invariable piping “wheet” uttered once a second. Alarm call is a grating “drrrzzt, drrrt, drrrt.” May be mistaken for a flycatcher, but its furtive nature and preference for thick understory are unique within its range."
0,Iriomote Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Sittiparus olivaceus,https://ebird.org/species/vartit2,"Reddish-brown songbird with a black crown and throat and olive-gray wings. Resident in broadleaf evergreen forests, especially in higher elevations, but poorly known. Endemic to Iriomote and Ishigaki Islands, in the southern Ryukyu Islands. Formerly considered conspecific with Varied Tit, and plumage intermediate between Varied Tit and Owston’s Tit, but neither has Iriomote’s olive wash on wings. Song resembles Japanese Tit, and nasal call recalls Varied Tit but drier."
0,Iris Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Saudareos iris,https://ebird.org/species/irilor1,"A small green parrot with a red forehead, an orange bill, a dark purple eye patch and crown, and a yellow collar. Juveniles show a brown bill. Found in small groups, mainly in the foothills, in forest and a variety of wooded areas. Confined to Wetar and Timor, where it overlaps with the larger and longer-tailed Marigold and Olive-headed Lorikeets. Iris Lorikeet shows a red forehead and pale throat, lacking the dark-hooded appearance of those lorikeets. Gives high-pitched screeches, “eeek,” similar to other lorikeets, but less harsh."
0,Isabela Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Oriolidae,Oriolus isabellae,https://ebird.org/species/isaori1,"A medium-sized bird of lowland forest, including secondary habitats and bamboo in northern Luzon. Yellow underparts blend into olive upperparts. Bill fairly long and silver. Forages for fruit and insects, sometimes in mixed-species flocks. Similar to White-lored Oriole, but slightly larger, with a silver rather than red bill and no white spot in front of the eye. Song consists of a medium-pitched, upslurred whistle, “hoowit!”."
0,Isabelline Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius isabellinus,https://ebird.org/species/isashr1,"Small pale sandy-colored shrike. Male is gray-brown above with a black mask and unmarked pale underparts that contrast with a bright cinnamon tail. Female is similar, but with a paler mask, grayer upperparts, and faint barring on the sides. Both sexes have pale underparts. Red-tailed Shrike looks similar, but male Red-tailed Shrikes have a contrasting warm brownish crown and females average whiter on the underparts. Female Red-backed Shrikes also have a warmer brown back and more prominent scaling patterns on a white breast and belly than Isabelline Shrikes. Typically found in dry brushy areas."
0,Isabelline Wheatear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Oenanthe isabellina,https://ebird.org/species/isawhe1,"A large pale wheatear. Gray-brown above with warm orangish tones on white underparts and a pale white eyebrow. Tail is predominantly black with white edges and it contrasts sharply with its snow-white rump. Somewhat similar in coloration to a toned-down female Northern Wheatear, but visibly larger, shorter-tailed, and longer-billed (all of which are accentuated by the typically tall, erect posture). Inhabits flat, open areas, often at middle to high elevations. Remarkable song has a tumbling quality that includes long ringing whistles, chattering, and imitations of other sounds in the surrounding environment. Calls include shorter whistles and hard “chak’s,” like rocks being struck together."
0,Island Imperial-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ducula pistrinaria,https://ebird.org/species/isipig1,"A large, long-necked pigeon, more uniformly gray than other imperial-pigeons in the region. Overall very pale, with a dark blue tail, a pinkish wash to throat and chest, and a gray back and wings. Birds in the Admiralty Islands have green wings and back. Relatively coastal, preferring smaller islands. Perches conspicuously in the open. Similar to Pacific Imperial-Pigeon, but overall paler. Birds on the Admiralty Islands differ from juvenile Red-knobbed Imperial-Pigeon in their gray, not cinnamon, belly and underside. Normally heard giving a high-pitched “ahu ahu ahu ahu” call, falling in pitch and volume."
0,Island Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus poliocephalus,https://ebird.org/species/islwar1,"A small warbler with a pale eyebrow, a dull greenish upperside, a white throat, and yellowish underparts. Sometimes shows a faint central crown stripe, and sometimes an indistinct wingbar. Widespread with small variations, perhaps indicating multiple cryptic species. Singles, pairs, or groups inhabit lowland and hill forest, often accompanying mixed-species flocks. Differs from Arctic, Japanese, and Kamchatka Leaf Warblers in being smaller, yellower underneath, and darker above, and in sometimes showing a central crown stripe. Sings a very variable high-pitched warble mixed with twittering phrases."
0,Island Scrub-Jay,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Aphelocoma insularis,https://ebird.org/species/issjay,"The largest and darkest scrub-jay, identifiable solely based on range: found exclusively on Santa Cruz Island off southern California. Similar to California Scrub-Jay but larger, with darker back and darker mask. Inhabits scrubby woodland habitat, often on or near the ground. Typically found in small family groups."
0,Island Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala phaionota,https://ebird.org/species/islwhi2,"A rather drab, medium-sized bird of wooded habitats on small islands. Gray head, white throat, brown back and very pale brown underparts with slightly darker brown smudges on the sides of the chest. Very similar to Brown-backed Whistler but does not co-occur. No similar species in range. Gives a jumbled, whistled song, interspersed with repeated, typical whistler “whip!” notes. Call, a sharp descending “jip!”."
0,Isthmian Wren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Troglodytidae,Cantorchilus elutus,https://ebird.org/species/istwre1,"Small, skulking wren of foothills and lowlands in southwestern Costa Rica south into Panama. Found in forest edges, second-growth thickets, and brushy fields with cane grass. Heard more often than seen: song relatively short with bright phrases usually repeated a few times in quick succession. Note the bold white eyebrow, whitish breast, rich buffy flanks, and bright rusty tail barred black. Formerly known as Plain Wren."
0,Italian Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer italiae,https://ebird.org/species/itaspa1,"Similar to House and Spanish Sparrows. Males have a brown crown and white cheeks like Spanish Sparrow, but a restricted black throat and upper breast like House Sparrow. Females essentially inseparable from the other two species and voice also identical. Habitat preferences similar to House Sparrow; rarely strays far from urban areas. An evolutionary intermediate between House and Spanish Sparrow following historical gene flow."
0,Itatiaia Spinetail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Asthenes moreirae,https://ebird.org/species/itaspi1,"Small, plain, long-billed and long-tailed spinetail with a restricted range. Found in bamboo thickets and clearings in montane forests with grass and shrubs where it forages in the understory. Note the rufous chin contrasting with a dull-brown body. The song is a high-pitched ascending and descending trill."
0,Ituri Batis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Platysteiridae,Batis ituriensis,https://ebird.org/species/itubat1,"A very small and striking gray, white, and black flycatcher-like bird with a very dark crown, a yellow eye, white wingbars, and a white spot above the bill base. Sexes similar. Juvenile has neck and wing washed buffy. Pairs are rare and localized residents in the middle levels and the canopy of secondary and primary lowland forest, below 1300 meters of elevation. The larger Rwenzori Batis has a broader breast band than Ituri Batis and tends to occur in montane forest above 1400 meters."
0,Ivory Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Pagophila eburnea,https://ebird.org/species/ivogul,"A spectacular and highly sought-after Arctic gull. Unmistakable in all plumages. Adults are entirely gleaming white with black legs and a bluish-green bill with an orange tip. Immatures have a dark face and variable black spotting on the wings and tail. Stocky and short-legged, suggesting an odd white pigeon as much as a typical gull. Almost always restricted to icy areas in the High Arctic, very rarely wandering further south in the winter. Can be seen singly or in loose groups, especially when feeding at a seal carcass. Typically very confiding."
0,Izu Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus celaenops,https://ebird.org/species/izuthr1,"Handsome songbird found only on Izu, Tokara, and a few other islands off the coast of Japan, where fairly common, most abundant in broadleaf evergreen forests. Male orange-brown above, rich orange below, with black hood, yellow bill, and yellow eyering. Female lacks male’s hood and intense colors; very similar to female and young Brown-headed Thrush but has extensive black spotting on the undertail coverts. Song recalls Japanese Robin’s."
0,Jabiru,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Jabiru mycteria,https://ebird.org/species/jabiru,"Huge, massive-billed, and unmistakable stork of tropical lowlands. Found in marshes and flooded fields, but nests high in large trees. Sometimes seen feeding in wetlands in loose association with other wading birds, which are all much smaller. Flies strongly and often high overhead, sometimes even soaring like a vulture. Plumage is wholly white (no black in wings in flight) but the naked head and neck are black, with a broad red band at base of the neck."
0,Jack Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Lymnocryptes minimus,https://ebird.org/species/jacsni,"A small snipe, with stripy and cryptic plumage. Similar in appearance to Common Snipe, but note shorter bill, dark crown without pale stripe down middle, and wide golden stripes or ""braces"" down the back. Found in fresh and brackish marshes, but rarely seen unless flushed, when usually flies up silently from almost underfoot and drops back down not too far away. Single birds feed quietly by probing in mud, usually near cover; walks with distinctive, near-constant bobbing motion."
0,Jackal Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo rufofuscus,https://ebird.org/species/jacbuz1,"A large, heavy buzzard with striking black, chestnut, and white patterning that is especially evident in flight. Occupies a wide range of open habitats, where it sits on poles, fences, and rocks hunting for small and large vertebrates. The harsh scolding “kaaaa-haa-haa” call is distinctive and similar to that of a jackal. A rare pale-chested morph can resemble Augur Buzzard, but Jackal Buzzard is always differentiated by the dark (not pale) forward part of the underwing. The brown-and-rufous juvenile Jackal Buzzard is similar to other buzzards, but it is larger, with broad wings and a hefty head."
0,Jackson's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Tockus jacksoni,https://ebird.org/species/jachor1,"A medium-sized black-and-white hornbill. Males have a mostly red bill with a small yellow or white tip; females have an all-black bill. Both sexes show white spotting across the wing. Found locally in dry savanna, usually in pairs or small groups. Similar to Von der Decken’s and Northern Red-billed Hornbills, but separated from the former by the white-spotted wing and from the latter by the yellow-tipped (male) or all-black (female) bill. The call is a series of low clucks."
0,Jackson's Widowbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Euplectes jacksoni,https://ebird.org/species/jacwid1,"A medium-sized dark widowbird. Breeding males are unmistakable, with a long downcurved tail and rufous shoulders. Non-breeding males lose their long tail and become streaky and brown, but keep the shoulder pattern. Females are brown and streaky year-round. Breeds in montane grassland, but sometimes found in cultivation and other open habitats. Otherwise usually in flocks, especially when not breeding. Males give an odd display in which they jump straight into the air. Females could be confused with many other species, but even during the non-breeding season are usually associated with males, which can be identified by their shoulder pattern. Non-breeding males could be confused with non-breeding male Fan-tailed Widowbird, but have a more restricted and less orange shoulder patch. The main vocalization is a dry “zrit.”"
0,Jacky-winter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Microeca fascinans,https://ebird.org/species/jacwin1,"Small Australian robin, gray-brown above and pale below; often swings tail side to side when perched. Dark tail with prominent white outer tail feathers, absent in similar Kimberley subspecies of Lemon-bellied Flycatcher. Female Hooded Robin similar but with darker wing showing pale panels. Female Golden Whistler much larger and plumper, with a thick bill and yellow lower belly. Usually in pairs in open woodlands, where it perches prominently, often on stumps and posts. Hunts by plucking prey from the ground, in typical Australian robin style."
0,Jalca Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus frankeae,https://ebird.org/species/miltap1,"Long known to ornithologists as something different (and informally called “Millpo Tapaculo”), this bird was finally described as a new species in 2020. It inhabits grassy, rock-strewn areas above tree line at high elevations in the eastern Andes of central Peru. Plumage is mainly gray with tan rear parts that are faintly barred, and it sometimes shows a faint, whitish eyebrow; female is browner than male. Similar in appearance to several other tapaculos, and best identified by range and voice. Song, often given from atop a rock, is a seemingly endless series of raspy chip notes."
0,Jamaican Becard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tityridae,Pachyramphus niger,https://ebird.org/species/jambec1,"A small but stout woodland species often found hovering beneath the canopy while snapping up insects or fruit. Note the male’s all blackish plumage. The only similar bird in its range is the Jamaican Blackbird, but the Jamaican Blackbird has a slimmer bill and it is typically found probing in vegetation rather than flycatching like the becard. Females and immatures are dark brown above and pale below, often with buff on throat. Females and immatures could be mistaken for Stolid, Sad, or Rufous-tailed Flycatchers, however, these flycatchers have grayish (not buff) throats and yellowish on the belly that female and immature becards lack. Song is a staccato squeaky twitter typically followed by a drawn out “tweeeee.” Call is a sharp but squeaky “peep.”"
0,Jamaican Blackbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Nesopsar nigerrimus,https://ebird.org/species/jambla1,"A species of higher elevation woodlands where it is often found feeding high in the trees, even near the forest canopy, rather unlike other blackbird species. Indeed, any blackbird found foraging within Jamaica’s upper elevation forests is very likely this species. Its plumage is all black, its tail is short, and the bill is moderately long and slim. The similar Shiny Cowbird has a shorter, stouter bill and a longer tail. The Greater Antillean Grackle is larger, longer-tailed, and has a pale (not dark) eye. The song is a wheezy “whee-whee-oooo” and variations thereof; common call is emphatic, squeaky “wheet.”"
0,Jamaican Crow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus jamaicensis,https://ebird.org/species/jamcro1,"An all black and somewhat large species that prefers wet forests but also occurs in open woodlands. Often found perched high on bare branches of trees or working epiphyte clumps and tree nooks in search of large insects and small lizards. All species in its range that are entirely black are considerably smaller than the Jamaican Crow. Calls include emphatic harsh “raaaa,” given singly or in series, a more leisurely “craaa-aa” and variations thereof, and somewhat of a musical burbling."
0,Jamaican Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiopagis cotta,https://ebird.org/species/jamela1,"A rather small woodland flycatcher that is easily overlooked. It is the only flycatcher in its range with a short white eyebrow and no wingbars. Also note the crisp white crescent below its eye and small black bill. Often detected by its song, which consists of several rapid, loud, slightly squeaky, descending notes (typically five): “Tsi-Tsi-Tsi-Tsi-Tsa”. It is most often found feeding high within the forest."
0,Jamaican Euphonia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Euphonia jamaica,https://ebird.org/species/jameup1,"A very small and active inhabitant of most wooded habitats and gardens where it forages mostly on fruits and flowers. Note this species’ short, stubby bill, and mostly gray head and underparts. The Orangequit is somewhat similar but is readily distinguished by its longer and slightly curved bill. Additionally, male Orangequits are darker gray and have an orange throat, while female Orangequits have brown upperparts. Song is rapid-fire jumble of squeaks, whistles, and buzzes. The call note is a sharp “tseet.” Jamaican Euphonias also give a scratchy, squeaky “bao,” which is given singly, in series, or interjected into songs."
0,Jamaican Lizard-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus vetula,https://ebird.org/species/jamlic1,"An impressive long-tailed bird of moist mid-elevation woodlands including secondary growth, where it feeds in the understory by peeking and probing into vegetation in pursuit of insects and lizards. Generally solitary and secretive, but not shy. Note this species’ long, straight, narrow bill and buff underparts. The Chestnut-bellied Cuckoo is similar in overall shape, but it is somewhat larger with a chestnut belly and a grayish chest; also note its bill is much shorter and somewhat curved compared to Jamaican Lizard-Cuckoo. The passingly similar Mangrove Cuckoo is somewhat smaller, shorter billed, lacks an eyering, and has a black mask. Jamaican Lizard-Cuckoos are often first detected by voice: a rapid-fire, ratcheting “k-k-k-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh-kuh…” that grows slower and louder as it progresses; usually given at a uniform pitch."
0,Jamaican Mango,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Anthracothorax mango,https://ebird.org/species/jamman1,"A large dark hummingbird of forest edges, plantations, and gardens. Its black underparts, iridescent red cheeks, and red-purple tail are unique within its range. Note that females and immatures of this species are not as vivid as males. Call is a sharp “tsic,” given individually or in a series."
0,Jamaican Oriole,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Icterus leucopteryx,https://ebird.org/species/jamori1,"A fruit-loving inhabitant of woodlands and gardens. Adult is yellow (often tinged green or orange), sports a black beard, and has very large white wing patches covering half of the otherwise black wing. Immatures look similar, but they have two broad white wingbars instead of a white patch. Immature male Orchard Oriole looks somewhat similar, but it is smaller and lacks the bold white wing markings seen on Jamaican Orioles. Songs include a rapid series of rich, whistled, and mostly down-slurred phrases and “cheat-you, cheat-you, cheat-you, cheat-you, cheat.”"
0,Jamaican Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Asio grammicus,https://ebird.org/species/jamowl1,"A somewhat large nocturnal inhabitant of wooded areas including gardens and parks; roosts in tree cavities or dense foliage during the day. The Barn Owl is of similar size, but it is much paler and lacks the Jamaican Owl’s prominent ear tufts. Vocalizations include a low, gruff “wa-waaa-o” and a crescendo/decrescendo “whoa.”"
0,Jamaican Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus pallidus,https://ebird.org/species/jampew1,"A small, plain woodland species often found flycatching from exposed perches at middle levels in the forest; often flicks tail once upon landing. Note that this species has relatively inconspicuous wingbars and no eyering. The similar Eastern Wood-Pewee has distinctly longer primaries (assessed by looking at how far the primaries extend beyond tertials), whitish wingbars, and rarely flicks its tail upon landing. The Greater Antillean Elaenia has bold white wingbars and an entirely dark bill unlike the Jamaican Pewee. Vocalizations include plaintive “wee-wee,” with the second note louder and both notes upslurred, a similarly plaintive ‘uh-weee-oo” with the middle portion upslurred, and a slightly rough, whistled “weeah.”"
0,Jamaican Spindalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Spindalidae,Spindalis nigricephala,https://ebird.org/species/jamspi,"A somewhat small woodland and scrubland bird that moves rather deliberately as it feeds on fruits and flowers and the occasional insect. Brilliant male is a swirl of yellows, oranges, and reds with black-and-white striped head; unlike any other Jamaican bird. Female has a similar pattern but drab colors. Call is a thin high-pitched “tsee” given singularly or in a rapid series."
0,Jamaican Tody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Todidae,Todus todus,https://ebird.org/species/jamtod1,"A small, gemlike, woodland species usually found in pairs. Its rather large head, long bill, and short tail create a unique profile. Also note the shimmering green upperparts and red throat. No similar species occur within its range. It usually hunts from low-to-middle level perches, sitting nearly still before leaping upwards to snatch prey. Vocalizations include a scratchy “zheh,” given in series at a rate of about one per second and a brief rapid rattle."
0,Jamaican Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo modestus,https://ebird.org/species/jamvir1,"A small inhabitant of thickets in woodlands and scrublands where it feeds by actively searching for insects within tangles; avoids mangroves and well-manicured woodlands that lack dense undergrowth. The Greater Antillean Elaenia shares this species’ wingbars and overall dull coloration, but the elaenia has prominent whitish markings around the eye and is usually found perched upright or flycatching. The Jamaican Vireo’s song includes a “chi-wee, chi-wee, chi-wee, chi-wee, you,” a “chi-wuh, chi-wuh, chi-wuh, zha,” and a “wee-wee-zhrr.” Calls include “jip,” given singly or in a series, and a harsh upslurred “zhweee.”"
0,Jamaican Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Melanerpes radiolatus,https://ebird.org/species/jamwoo1,"A striking medium-sized species of wooded habitats. The white face framed by the red of its nape and crown and its finely barred black-and-white back is distinctive; resembles no other species in its range. Sometimes first detected by its determined excavation of rotting wood. Vocalizations include an emphatic, slightly rough “urp,” and a burry “urr-urr-urr-urr” given as a rapid rolling burst."
0,Jambandu Indigobird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Vidua raricola,https://ebird.org/species/jamind1,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Zebra Waxbills. Breeding males are glossy black with green or blue iridescence and a pale brownish panel in the wings. Females and non-breeding males are streaky and brown on the back and pale below, with a bold facial pattern. The bill is whitish and the legs very pale purplish. A scarce and poorly known species. Found in wetlands, moist grasslands, and cultivation. Given current knowledge, can only be confidently identified by vocalizations. Imitates the “svet” calls of its host, Zebra Waxbill, and often mixes them into a scratchy jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Jambu Fruit-Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Ptilinopus jambu,https://ebird.org/species/jafdov1,"The plum-red face and pink “blush” on the white chest of the cartoonish-looking male are unique. Plainer female and juvenile can be difficult to separate from female Black-naped Fruit Dove; look out for Jambu’s bright white eye-ring and orange bill. Generally uncommon and nomadic; roams widely across lowland and foothill forests, where it seeks out fruiting trees. Forages quietly in the canopy, typically singly or in pairs."
0,James's Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicoparrus jamesi,https://ebird.org/species/jamfla1,"Rather local; found at salt lakes and bogs in the high Andes. Associates readily with Chilean and Andean Flamingos, although each species often stays slightly apart within mixed groups. James’s is the smallest New World flamingo best identified by its relatively short, stubby bill, which is yellow with a black tip. Adult and older immature have distinctive red legs and feet (can be whitish when caked with dried salt). Immature is whitish overall, like other immature flamingos."
0,Jameson's Antpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Parmoptila jamesoni,https://ebird.org/species/jamant1,"A small, slender-billed, warbler-like waxbill with pinkish-brown legs and different-looking sexes: the male has a red forehead, dull brown upperparts, and a rusty-chestnut face and underparts, while the female has a tawny-brown face and cheeks, pale buff underparts with scattered dark chevrons, and dull brown upperparts. Pairs and small groups forage by themselves or in mixed-species flocks, in the understory and middle levels of primary, secondary, and gallery forest, often near water. Eats insects, with a fondness for ants. Call is a high-pitched, downslurred “whseet.”"
0,Jameson's Firefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lagonosticta rhodopareia,https://ebird.org/species/jamfir1,"Small pinkish waxbill with a blue-gray bill and black under the tail. Found along forest edge, and in cultivation, thick woodland, and scrub. Usually in pairs or small groups. Most common vocalization is a short trill. Similar to Red-billed and Bar-breasted firefinches but shows black under the tail. Can be extremely similar to African Firefinch subspecies without gray on the head, but Jameson’s is paler and more pinkish overall."
0,Jameson's Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago jamesoni,https://ebird.org/species/andsni1,"Chunky snipe of very high elevations in the Andes. Plumage has a complicated pattern of brown, buff, and black; note extensive barring on underparts and thick, drooping bill. Might be confused with Noble Snipe, but does not have a white belly. Compared to Imperial Snipe, it is smaller and lacks the warm, cinnamon coloration. Jameson’s Snipe inhabits paramo grasslands and stunted forest near tree line. Shy and rarely encountered unless flushed, when it gives a burst of sharp, abrupt “kek” notes."
0,James's Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoenicoparrus jamesi,https://ebird.org/species/jamfla1,"Rather local; found at salt lakes and bogs in the high Andes.

Bright red iris and fine white streaking in the face distinctive. Occurs in high-elevation dwarf pine forests near and above the tree line during the breeding season and in streamside thickets of lower elevations during nonbreeding season. Gives intricate high-pitched songs from the top of dwarf pines. Its “tililili” call recalls the first portion of the song."
0,Japanese Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Horornis diphone,https://ebird.org/species/jabwar,"A small, plain brown warbler of dense undergrowth. Note the narrow dark line through eye and the narrow white line above the eye. Occurs in forest understory, dense shrubland, bamboo thickets, and forest edges. Usually secretive and hard to see well, but males sometimes sing from an exposed perch. Song is a long introductory tone followed by a rapid warble, “uuuuuu-guisu,” from which the Japanese name is derived. Introduced to the Hawaiian Islands where it occurs on all of the main islands."
0,Japanese Cormorant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Phalacrocorax capillatus,https://ebird.org/species/japcor1,"A large dark cormorant of rocky marine shorelines, rarely recorded inland, unlike similar Great Cormorant, which is widespread inland. Similar to Great, but adult has more extensive white in the throat and in breeding plumage shows green (not bronze) sheen above. Juvenile usually has paler underparts than young Great. In all plumages, Japanese shows more bare orange-yellow skin above the eye than Great but has a much smaller gular pouch (bare skin of the throat)."
0,Japanese Grosbeak,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Eophona personata,https://ebird.org/species/japgro1,"A large finch with a powerful hulking bill that is an inhabitant of deciduous and mixed forests.

Migratory race breeds in northern and central Japan and northeastern China and Russia, and winters in eastern and southeastern China, where it tends to be less common than Yellow-billed Grosbeak. Resident race present year-round in central and southern Japan."
0,Japanese Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus xanthodryas,https://ebird.org/species/arcwar3,"Small songbird, a member of the Arctic Warbler complex, this species looks essentially identical to Arctic Warbler and Kamchatka Leaf Warbler but is more evenly yellowish. Normally only distinguished in the field by breeding range and song: breeds in forests on all of the main Japanese islands except Hokkaido, where it is replaced in summer by Kamchatka Leaf Warbler. Favors foothill to montane areas with dense brushy understory; can be found in more open wooded habitats in migration and on wintering grounds. Song resembles that of Arctic in general pitch and register but is less uniform, like a more rising and falling version of Arctic’s song. Call also similar but averages lower in pitch."
0,Japanese Murrelet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Synthliboramphus wumizusume,https://ebird.org/species/japmur1,"Small, plump seabird of marine habitats, closer to shore during breeding season, in open waters otherwise; occasionally visits inlets and harbors, especially in late winter and spring. Similar to thinner-billed Ancient Murrelet, both being gray above, white below, darker flight feathers and white underwing coverts. In nonbreeding plumage, Japanese has white throat and lores, white stippling in crown; in breeding plumage, white plumes in crest much broader than Ancient. Sharp “chi-chi-chi” call recalls buntings’ flight calls."
0,Japanese Night-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Gorsachius goisagi,https://ebird.org/species/janher1,"A small brown heron with awkward-looking, hunched appearance. Occurs in dense, damp lowland and foothill forests next to bodies of water, where it hunts prey in dense cover. Paler crown and weaker crest than similar Malayan Night-Heron and lacks the white wingtips of that species. Shy and difficult to see; most readily observed during migration, when it sometimes visits more open habitats. Gives hooting calls at regular intervals, especially in early evening."
0,Japanese Paradise-Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Terpsiphone atrocaudata,https://ebird.org/species/japfly1,"Graceful songbird of well-shaded forests, particularly stream gullies; often in more open habitat in migration. Stunning breeding male purplish-black above and white below, with a short crest, neon-blue eyerings, and long black tail streamers. Female and non-breeding male have dark gray head and chest, paler eyering, shorter crest, and chestnut-brown wings and tail, without streamers. Compare with female and non-breeding male Amur and Blyth’s paradise-flycatchers, with which Japanese overlaps on its Southeast Asian wintering grounds. Note Japanese’s contiguous dark gray throat and chest (Amur has a more sharply-demarcated black throat and gray chest), dull darkish wings (Blyth’s has brighter rufous wings), and fairly clean demarcation between gray breast and white belly (Blyth’s has a more gradual fade). Song a run-on series of coarse whistles; call a rough, nasal “bee.”"
0,Japanese Pygmy Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Yungipicus kizuki,https://ebird.org/species/pygwoo1,"Small black-and-white woodpecker with round-headed, short-billed profile. Both sexes have a pale, lightly streaked belly and white bars on the back, but only the male has a tiny red fleck at the back of the eyebrow. Often forages on thin twigs and outreaching branches too slender for other woodpeckers, hanging upside down like a tit or nuthatch. Slightly larger Gray-capped Woodpecker is longer-billed, with a buffy belly and different head pattern. Gives extremely high, thin “tsi tsi tsi” calls and a single quick, echoing drum."
0,Japanese Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Coturnix japonica,https://ebird.org/species/japqua,"A compact, cryptically-colored, very shy bird of grassy areas, including both natural meadows and some agricultural fields, where it remains hidden from view on the ground unless flushed at close range. Both sexes brown overall with a pale face, long white eyebrows, and subtle stippling and striping on the back and breast. Breeding males have a reddish-brown face and throat. Vocal mostly during the breeding season; males give a dry, explosive three-noted song from cover. Flushed birds fly with noisy, whistling wings, unlike crakes or shorebirds. Introduced to Hawaii, found on all of the main islands. A common avicultural bird, so escapees may occur around the world."
0,Japanese Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Larvivora akahige,https://ebird.org/species/japrob1,"Small songbird with distinctive orange breast and dull brown upperparts; male has dark breast band separating orange chest from pale belly. Sticks to the undergrowth in both its montane breeding grounds and lowland wintering grounds, though its presence in the former may be given away by its loud song: a trill following a single loud introductory note. Occasionally found in parks and gardens on migration."
0,Japanese Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus semitorques,https://ebird.org/species/jasowl1,"Small grayish owl with prominent ear tufts and dark red eyes, found in lowland and hill forests, forest edges, parks, and gardens. Ryukyu Scops-Owl and Oriental Scops-Owl both have yellow to orangish eyes; Japanese has a more complete collar and more contrastingly pale facial disc. Vocalizations include a variety of meowing, croaking, and barking calls, as well as shrill screeches."
0,Japanese Sparrowhawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter gularis,https://ebird.org/species/japspa1,"Typical Accipiter hawk. Adult slaty gray above and finely barred with brownish orange below. Smaller and more compact-looking than Eurasian Sparrowhawk. Soaring adults can be distinguished from Chinese Sparrowhawk by the lack of dark wingtips and striped (instead of solidly pale) underwings. In all plumages, heavily marked underwing coverts distinguish this species from Chinese Sparrowhawk. Breeds in a variety of forested hill and lowland habitats; wintering birds can also be found in more open habitats, such as forest edge and fields."
0,Japanese Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus cardis,https://ebird.org/species/japthr1,"Elusive thrush, seldom seen far from cover. Favors well-shaded streamsides, gullies, and valleys in broadleaf hill forests during the breeding season, but can be found in sparser habitats in the non-breeding season. Adult male sharply marked and beautiful if seen well, combining coal-black upperparts with a snow-white belly punctuated with dark speckles. Immature male gray above, belly tinged orange. Female medium brown above with white underparts marked with both dark speckles and an orange suffusion; can be confused with female Gray-backed Thrush, but dark markings in Japanese extend to lower belly (restricted to the throat in Gray-backed). Rich, lengthy song often very repetitive."
0,Japanese Tit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Parus minor,https://ebird.org/species/gretit4,"Large and pugnacious, this common tit is found in a wide range of wooded habitats, from dense hill forests to manicured city parks. Found throughout much of East Asia, this species is closely-related to the more brightly-colored Great Tit, from which it was split as a distinct species. Adult has a flashy white cheek on a black head, a black stripe on a white belly, and gray wings with a hint of green near the shoulder. Juveniles are duller, replacing the adult’s black with gray. Very vocal; song is a bright “tzi-hei tzi-hei!”; also gives loud chips, seeps, and harsh “tzi-tzi-tzshhhhhh.”"
0,Japanese Wagtail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Motacilla grandis,https://ebird.org/species/japwag1,"Large, boldly patterned, long-tailed songbird of waterside areas, particularly fast-flowing streams but also rivers, pools, inland lakes, and coastal areas. Adult male velveteen black with white belly, wings, throat, brow, and outer tail feathers. Adult female similar but grayish black above. Juvenile similar, with soft, pale gray upperparts; juvenile of Japanese subspecies of White Wagtail similar but shows white arc behind eye. Calls distinctively buzzy."
0,Japanese Waxwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Bombycillidae,Bombycilla japonica,https://ebird.org/species/japwax1,"The only waxwing endemic to the old world, this species is similar to its Bohemian relative, but with pink instead of yellow tail tips and a yellow-tinged belly. Irruptive and inconsistent in its movements during the colder months, following crops of berries to wintering grounds, where it frequently gathers in large and noisy feeding flocks. Combination of dark mask, loose crest, and overall brown coloration distinguish it from similarly-sized non-waxwing species in its range."
0,Japanese Wood-Pigeon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba janthina,https://ebird.org/species/jawpig1,"The largest pigeon in the region, with dark purplish plumage except for metallic green around the neck. Generally uncommon endemic of offshore Japanese and to a lesser extent Chinese and Korean islands. Occurs in mature broadleaf forests, where it forages on the ground or in canopy. Also favors pines, especially in the Ryukyu Islands. Rustles about loudly when feeding. Deep call and slow moaning song may recall the everyday Rock Pigeon."
0,Java Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Padda oryzivora,https://ebird.org/species/javspa,"A small, plump finch with a very thick pink bill. The black head and white cheek patch are distinctive. Juveniles have a similar color pattern but are grayer. Social; forages in flocks and roosts communally. Forages in rice fields, grasslands, meadows, and urban and suburban areas (in introduced range). Call consists of one or more musical chirps. Native to the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali, where now quite rare. Introduced widely across the globe including India, Philippines, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, and the Hawaiian Islands."
0,Javan Banded-Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Hydrornis guajanus,https://ebird.org/species/banpit2,"Beautiful ground-dweller with black mask, clean white throat, and finely barred underparts. Male has an egg-yolk-yellow eyebrow, royal-blue “bib”, and black crown. Female has a dull tan-yellow eyebrow and brown crown. Both sexes have a bright blue tail and a white “racing stripe” down the edge of the wing. Inhabits a range of wooded habitats, from primary wet forest to overgrown plantations and dry scrub, in the lowlands and foothills of Java and Bali. Forages on the ground, either singly or in pairs. Gives a loud, bright “whOW!” and a low rolling trill."
0,Javan Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis banyumas,https://ebird.org/species/hibfly3,"A medium-sized flycatcher with strikingly different male and female plumages. Male is beautifully colored, with deep blue upperparts, mostly orange underparts, and a white belly. Female is much duller, with a grayish head, gray-brown wings, a rufous tail, and rufous-washed underparts. Found at low and middle elevations in forest, especially in densely vegetated ravines and stands of bamboo. Song mixes melodious warbling and whistling with thin “seet” notes. Calls are a loud “chek” or “tak,” reminiscent of stones tapping. Male resembles male Mangove Blue Flycatcher, but generally found in different habitat and separated by darker blue back and more uniformly rufous underparts, including the chin. Female can be confused with many other flycatchers, but is usually identified by its combination of a rufous-washed breast and a lack of wingbars."
0,Javan Cochoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Cochoa azurea,https://ebird.org/species/javcoc1,"Slow-moving and highly elusive chunky Javan endemic, found only in montane and foothill forests. Generally scarce and difficult to pick out in the dark forest due to its coloration and inactive behavior. Males are entirely blue, with some paler highlights on the crown and wings. Female has a mostly dark brownish body with blue most evident in the wings, tail, and crown. Combination of size, shape, and behavior serve to distinguish this infrequently-encountered species from other dark blue forest birds, such as Javan Whistling-Thrush and the Javan subspecies of Sunda Robin. Vocalizations include high, thin whistles and harsh chattering."
0,Javan Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina javensis,https://ebird.org/species/javcus1,"Burly bird with a dark and heavy bill. Gray above and pale whitish below. Smudgy dark patch around the eye is present on both sexes, but more prominent on males. Females can have faint barring on the underparts, and average paler overall. Sunda Cuckooshrike is darker, with a gray belly and darker mask. Like other large cuckooshrikes, often perches up prominently in bare trees, hawking for insects from exposed perches. Typically singly, or in pairs or small loose groups. Regularly flicks wings. Quite vocal, often giving a loud, rippling “wheeEEIR!”, as well as a squeaky “whee’yiiIIP!”"
0,Javan Flameback,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Chrysocolaptes strictus,https://ebird.org/species/javfla1,"Dashing and uncommon pale-eyed woodpecker, found only in lowland and foothill woodlands and forests on Bali and eastern Java. Note lustrous golden-brown back and wings, black-and-white barring on the sides, black mask, and well-defined scaling on the neck and breast.

0,Javan Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus javensis,https://ebird.org/species/javfro3,"Endemic to Java, where it is the only frogmouth. Fairly typical-looking small frogmouth, with brown plumage broken up by white patches and pale barring on the tail. Readily separated from nightjars by its upright pose and forward-facing eyes, and from owls by its bristly “whiskered” face, lack of a facial disc, large broad-based bill, and long tail. Inhabits a wide range of wooded habitats from lowlands up into montane foothills, from dense rainforests to the edges of large plantations with suitable tall growth. Nocturnal, and can be difficult to spot on day roost. Gives a variety of calls, including a series of descending whistles, a high-pitched growl followed by a strangled whistle, and short, grating screams."
0,Javan Fulvetta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Alcippe pyrrhoptera,https://ebird.org/species/javful1,"Unremarkable-looking warm brown songbird. Endemic to Java’s montane and submontane broadleaf forests, where it is a common member of mixed flocks. Note warm rusty-toned wings and tail, long-tailed and round-headed profile, and slender dark line above the eye (sometimes inconspicuous). Song is a sad-sounding series of whistles. Calls include a fast rattling call, as well as a high-pitched, tinkling “ji’jink.”"
0,Javan Green-Magpie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Cissa thalassina,https://ebird.org/species/shtmag1,"Extremely rare and nearing extinction in the wild, this fluorescent green Javan endemic with a black bandit’s mask and bulbous lipstick-red bill is an unmistakable and unforgettable sight for any birder lucky enough to glimpse one. Found only in foothill forests, often joining mixed flocks. Can be quite loud, even when hidden away in dense middle levels of forest, giving chattering shrieks and a vibrant, liquid-sounding “wee’da’da!”"
0,Javan Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Halcyon cyanoventris,https://ebird.org/species/javkin1,"Large kingfisher with a massive lipstick-red bill. Note dark head, dark chestnut throat and chest, purplish body, electric blue wings, and large black shoulder patch. Bright white wing patches revealed in flight. Uses a variety of both wet and dry lowland and foothill habitats, including ponds, mangroves, agricultural fields, open forest, and scrub. Can be close to human habitation. Gives high piping screams, often in series."
0,Javan Munia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lonchura leucogastroides,https://ebird.org/species/javmun1,"Plain brown munia with a dark face and a white belly. Similar in appearance to White-rumped Munia, with which it overlaps in southern Sumatra; look out for dark, instead of white rump. Inhabits lowland fields, meadows, wetlands, and edge. Occasionally mixes with other species of munias, particularly when food is plentiful; otherwise found in small flocks, in pairs, and singly. Native to Indonesia; introduced to parts of Malaysia and Singapore."
0,Javan Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Acridotheres javanicus,https://ebird.org/species/whvmyn,"Originally restricted to the Indonesian islands of Java and Bali, this crested myna has since been introduced to Singapore, Taiwan, and various parts of Malaysia and Indonesia. Dark gray overall with a spiffy erect crest and a bright yellowish-orange bill. Darker than Jungle Myna, with which it overlaps in both its native and introduced ranges. Also compare with Crested Myna; note Javan’s brighter bill and white vent. Bold and social, foraging in farms, parks, and gardens. Roosts in large noisy flocks, often close to human habitation."
0,Javan Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium castanopterum,https://ebird.org/species/javowl1,"Chunky small owl with a big rounded head. Note finely barred head, bright chestnut back and wings, and white underparts marked with long brown streaks. The only owlet on Java; shape and coloration eliminate any scops-owl. Unlike Collared Owlet, this is a primarily nocturnal species, only rarely remaining active through the day. Inhabits forest and forest edge from lowlands up into foothills. Song is a barbet-like series of trilling barks which accelerates rapidly before ending suddenly."
0,Javan Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius javanicus,https://ebird.org/species/javplo1,"Relatively small plain plover, found from Java east through the Lesser Sundas. Brown above and white below, with a neat white collar, forehead, and eyebrow. Brown shoulder spur sometimes forms a complete thin band across the chest. Breeding adults have orange tinging behind the eye and around the collar. Juvenile is similar to non-breeding adult, but has pale-fringed upper body feathers. Very similar to Kentish Plover, but note Javan’s warm brown patch behind ears, lack of orange on the crown in breeding plumage, and paler legs. Malaysian Plover is also similar, but always has white fringes on brown upper body feathers, and warm tones on the head. A coastal species, found on beaches, mudflats, estuaries, fishponds, and wet fields. Gives soft peeps and a questioning “week?”"
0,Javan Pond-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola speciosa,https://ebird.org/species/japher1,"Stout heron with flashing white wings; can be mistaken for a egret in flight, but note darker head in all plumages. Handsome in breeding plumage, with creamy head, dark red breast, and lacy black plumes on the back. Streaky brown nonbreeding plumage is nearly indistinguishable from other pond-herons. Forages in rice paddies, pond and lake edges, and mangroves."
0,Javan Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus angelinae,https://ebird.org/species/jasowl2,"Typical scops-owl, endemic to Java’s montane and foothill forests. Favors the upper and middle levels of the forest, frequently roosting and foraging in the lower canopy. Warm brown with black streaks on the chest and prominent white eyebrows. Also note bright orange eyes. Collared Scops-Owl can be similar, but is larger overall, with darker eyes, more solid facial border, and less contrasting eyebrows. Quiet for a scops-owl, vocalizing fairly infrequently--listen for its squealing “eEEE-eeee”, which often has a trembling quality. Also gives sharper, shorter squeal calls, and a gruff “wurk.”"
0,Javan Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga mystacalis,https://ebird.org/species/scasun1,"Medium-sized sunbird of foothill forest and forest edge on Java; uncommon to rare in upper montane and lowland habitats. Forages actively in pairs, mixed flocks, or singly. Both sexes are very similar to Crimson Sunbird, but note Javan's bright white belly and sides. Female Javans can also be confused with White-flanked and the Leptocoma sunbirds, but have more white on the sides and belly than those species. Song is a very flat and insect-like series of dry “chit” notes; also gives a sparrow-like “chiweet.”"
0,Javan Tesia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Tesia superciliaris,https://ebird.org/species/javtes1,"Tiny short-tailed ground-dweller, restricted to foothill and montane forests on Java. Favors areas with dense, tangled undergrowth, in which it bounces around actively. Olive-brown with a gray head and chest. Black line through the eye gives this little bird a strongly “eyebrowed” appearance. Due to size and dense habitat, this tiny warbler can be difficult to track down; listen for its song, a tumbling, jumbled series of beautiful high-pitched notes. Also note call, a dry rattling trill."
0,Javan Trogon,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Trogoniformes,Trogonidae,Harpactes reinwardtii,https://ebird.org/species/javtro1,"Beautiful and highly range-restricted trogon found only in Java’s far western belt of volcanoes, where it inhabits montane and foothill forests at 900-2500 meters. Unmistakable, decked out in all the colors of the rainbow: note bright red bill, yellow breast, orange belly, olive-green head and chest, glossy blue-green back, and purple-and-green bare facial skin. Perches quietly in the middle levels of the forest. Sometimes joins mixed feeding flocks, flying noisily with whirring windbeats. Gives a harsh descending trill."
0,Javan Whistling-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myophonus glaucinus,https://ebird.org/species/javwht1,"Chunky dark blue bird. Brightest blue on the nape and shoulder. Readily distinguished from similar species by shape, uniform plumage, and dark bill. Often spreads its short tail in a rather unimpressive gesture. Endemic to Java and Bali, where it inhabits foothill and montane forests at 800-2400 meters. Typically encountered close to or on the ground, but will also perch up on branches at mid-height. Favors areas with rocky outcrops, sometimes (but not always) near water. Can be quite tame, especially in areas frequented by people. Gives a sharp, resonant “tsee-chk-chk!”"
0,Javan Woodcock,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Scolopax saturata,https://ebird.org/species/duswoo4,"Rare and reclusive long-billed inhabitant of moist montane and foothill forests at 1350-3000 meters. Dark brown and heavily patterned overall, with densest patterning on the back. Small pale patch present on upper belly. Forages in dense vegetation, flushing explosively if sufficiently startled. Can be quite tame, allowing close approach if located. Flies between and sings from display perches, giving a fast-paced series of “chu” notes. Also gives a high-pitched sneezing call, and a lower harsh note."
0,Jelski's Black-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Knipolegus signatus,https://ebird.org/species/andtyr3,"Rare flycatcher found in cloud forest along the east slope of the Andes in northern and central Peru, barely reaching over the border into southeastern Ecuador. Male is dark sooty gray; female is grayish-olive with pale wingbars and faint streaking below. Similar to White-winged Black-Tyrant, but male Jelski’s is grayer and lacks white in the wings (which is usually only evident in flight) and female Jelski’s is much darker, especially on the underparts. No overlap with Plumbeous Black-Tyrant."
0,Jerdon's Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Chrysomma altirostre,https://ebird.org/species/jerbab1,"Warm brown babbler with a distinctive round-headed and short-billed profile. Extremely localized, restricted to disappearing patches of tall riverine grassland and reedbeds. Usually in pairs or small groups.

0,Jerdon's Baza,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Aviceda jerdoni,https://ebird.org/species/jerbaz1,"Medium-sized raptor with a prominent white-tipped black crest that is usually erect. Shows conspicuous pale reddish barring on a white belly. Smaller size and narrower wing bases in flight separate it from hawk-eagles, and longer wings and completely feathered legs at rest separate it from Crested Goshawk and other accipiters. Sedentary across its range, occurring in wet tropical and subtropical forests across South and Southeast Asia. Difficult to see if not soaring; often tucked away in forest canopy."
0,Jerdon's Courser,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Glareolidae,Rhinoptilus bitorquatus,https://ebird.org/species/jercou1,"A delicate lapwing-like bird with a large eye and a short, bicolored bill.

Male has a dark blue throat patch outlined by a thick black border. Female has a pale blue throat with no dark border. Only similarly-colored bird in range is the Golden-fronted Leafbird, which has an orange forehead. Jerdon’s Leafbird is a species of lowland and foothill forests, particularly dry open wooded areas and forest edges. Joins mixed-species flocks, particularly at flowering and fruiting trees. Song is an assemblage of harsh squeaks, buzzing notes, whistles, and imitations of other species."
0,Jerdon's Minivet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Pericrocotus albifrons,https://ebird.org/species/whbmin2,"Dainty minivet of dry forests, scrubland, and cultivation edge in Myanmar’s central Irrawaddy plains. Male is black and white, with an orange patch on the chest. Female is paler, replacing much of the male’s black with soft gray-brown. Both sexes have a broad white eyebrow, large white wing patches, and a white rump with a pale orangish patch in the center. Often moves in pairs and small flocks. Song is a high, sweet burst of warbling twitters. Calls include sharp “djeep” and a buzzier descending whistle."
0,Jerdon's Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgus atripennis,https://ebird.org/species/jernig1,"Large-headed nightjar with a bright white throat. Male shows bright white patches near the wingtips and on the edges of the tail that are buffy-brown in females. Large-tailed Nightjar is very similar; in Jerdon’s, look for less-streaked crown and smaller wing patches. Indian Nightjar is smaller and much more intricately patterned, lacking the white throat. Song is a strange bubbling “bwr-wr-wr,” usually heard at dusk or dawn in wooded areas."
0,Jet Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacra nigricans,https://ebird.org/species/jetant1,"Small slender antbird, found in pairs skulking through low tangles in forest and edges. Male is very dark black with obvious white fringes on shoulder. Female similar to male but gray instead of black and shows white streaks on throat. Could be confused with Dot-winged Antwren, which is less skulky and has larger white spots on wing and tail; also note very different female plumage. Usually heard more often than seen; listen for harsh nasal song emanating from from the undergrowth: “reh-er, reh-er, reh-er.”"
0,Jet Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Chloropipo unicolor,https://ebird.org/species/jetman2,"Rarely encountered large manakin found in dense undergrowth of humid forests, mostly on outlying ridges along the east slope of the Andes. Male is entirely black with white underwings, visible when the wings are flicked or the bird flies; unlike any other manakin in range. Female is entirely brown and might be confused for a schiffornis, but note smaller size and white underwings. Most often noticed by its voice, a distinctive rising nasal “tuwee!”."
0,Jobi Manucode,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Manucodia jobiensis,https://ebird.org/species/jobman1,"A large bird of lowland rainforest. All black with red eye. Purplish-blue iridescence on wings and tail and iridescent scaling on the chest and back. Shy and little known. Best seen at fruiting trees.

0,Johanna's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris johannae,https://ebird.org/species/johsun2,"A large, long-billed sunbird of forest and forest edge, sometimes venturing into gardens and farms. Both sexes have a distinctive long and mostly straight bill with a noticeable droop towards the tip. Males are iridescent green above and dark below with a green throat, a red-and-purple chest, and a maroon belly. Females are light brown above with a subtle eye-line, and pale with fine brown streaking below. Most likely to be confused with Splendid Sunbird, but look for the male’s green throat and maroon rather than red belly, and the female’s finely streaked underparts. Call is a descending whistled “tiuw.” The song is a complex jumble of whistled notes, not unlike that of other sunbirds."
0,Jos Plateau Indigobird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Viduidae,Vidua maryae,https://ebird.org/species/jopind1,"A nest parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of Rock Firefinches.

Given current knowledge, can only be confidently identified by vocalizations. Imitates the vocalizations of its host, Rock Firefinch, including soft “teew” whistles, a descending trill, “tep” notes, and “pit-pit-pit” calls. These are often mixed into a scratchy jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Josephine's Lorikeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Charmosyna josefinae,https://ebird.org/species/joslor1,"A medium-sized, long-tailed lorikeet of foothill and lower montane forest. Red head and chest, green back, broad black line around the back of the head and a yellow undertail and tip. Similar to Fairy Lorikeet, but Josephine’s Lorikeet is distinctly larger, has a dark patch on the belly and lacks streaking on the chest. Travels in pairs or small groups looking for flowering trees where it associates with other species. Also similar to red morph Papuan Lorikeet, but Josephine’s is smaller with a much shorter tail. Call, a high-pitch, ringing “srik!” note."
0,Jouanin's Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Bulweria fallax,https://ebird.org/species/joupet,"An all-dark, pigeon-sized petrel. Very bulky, with broad wings and a heavy, dark bill. Similar to Bulwer’s Petrel, but Jouanin’s appears heavier overall with a shorter tail, a larger bill, and no white on the wings. Strong flier, gliding often with occasional wingbeats, and staying close to the water."
0,Joyful Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Chlorocichla laetissima,https://ebird.org/species/joygre1,"A large, richly colored greenbul, yellow-olive on the back and yellow below with a red eye. Found locally in humid forest at middle elevations, usually in groups, at middle levels of the forest and in the sub-canopy. More colorful than other greenbuls that overlap in range. Similar to Prigogine’s Greenbul, but distinguished by the lack of gray on the face and lack of white on the chin. Named for its exuberant song, several chattering calls that ascend and accelerate into a bubbly, explosive sequence, usually given by multiple birds together."
0,Jungle Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Argya striata,https://ebird.org/species/junbab2,"This familiar ash-brown colored babbler has a yellow bill and a dark brow in front of the eye that contrasts with its pale eye giving it a perpetual “angry” look. It has vague streaking on the upperparts, diffuse mottling on its throat, and barring on its tail. The multiple races vary slightly in color and strength of markings except the race somervillei of the NW peninsula which has dark brown outer wing feathers that contrast with the rest of the wing. They are often seen in noisy flocks hopping on the ground and flicking litter in search of food."
0,Jungle Bush-Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Perdicula asiatica,https://ebird.org/species/jubqua1,"A small, plump terrestrial bird, roughly spherical in shape. Identified by its rusty throat and rusty-and-white eyebrow. Males have barred underparts while females have uniform pinkish cinnamon underparts. Found in dry stony scrub jungles and dry grasslands. Often seen in groups of 2–7 (but can occur in groups up to 20). Generally secretive until flushed when it suddenly bursts into flight, flying with weak whirring wingbeats low over the ground before quickly dropping into cover. Feeds on grass,seeds, and small insects."
0,Jungle Myna,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Acridotheres fuscus,https://ebird.org/species/junmyn1,"Typical “crested myna,” dark gray overall (darkest on head and wings) with white vent and wing patches, yellow-orange bill and legs, and small tufted crest above base of bill. Contrary to its name, usually found in open areas such as farmland, fields, and parks. Similar in appearance to Javan Myna, but shorter-crested, paler overall, and with partially black bill (Javan has entirely yellowish-orange bill). Song consists of harsh, crackling, yet melodic notes."
0,Jungle Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Caprimulgus indicus,https://ebird.org/species/grynig2,"Gray-brown nightjar of wooded, open grassy, and scrubby areas; not restricted to jungles. Intricately patterned, with a golden patch behind the ear (often not visible on a resting bird) and pale tan spots on the wings. Male shows bright white patches near the wingtips and on the edges of the tail that are buffy-brown in females. Similar Savanna Nightjar is much more densely patterned and lacks the tan wing spots; Savanna also tends to roost on the ground, versus in trees for Jungle Nightjar. Song is utterly alien-sounding and unique: a long series of bouncing “pooKIHpooKIHpooKIH” notes, comparable to a cartoon laser gun."
0,Jungle Owlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Glaucidium radiatum,https://ebird.org/species/junowl1,"Squat little owl with dense barring all over the body. Lacks the false eyes on the back of the head possessed by many other owlets. Gives bursts of loud hollow trills, comparable to barbets, as well as a mellow “kaaaooo-kaaaaooo-kah-ow!” A forest species, found in densely wooded areas in lowlands and foothills. Most active at dawn and dusk."
0,Jungle Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia sylvatica,https://ebird.org/species/junpri1,"Dull brown prinia. Largely devoid of eye-catching field marks: gray-brown above and white below with pale eyebrow. Plain Prinia can be very similar, but Jungle averages larger and more thickset, with a heavier bill and weaker eyebrows. Look for this skulker in dry scrubby tangles, often in areas intermixed with boulders. Forages close to the ground. Song is a rollicking, repetitive “ti’li’lew-ti’li’lew-ti’le’lew.” Also gives various chip notes, as well as a loud chatter when agitated."
0,Junin Grebe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Podicipediformes,Podicipedidae,Podiceps taczanowskii,https://ebird.org/species/jungre1,"Critically endangered grebe found only on Lake Junín in the high Andes of central Peru. Adults are gray and white with a ruby-red eye; young birds have a brownish tinge. Extremely similar to the far more common Silvery Grebe, but Junin Grebe is slightly larger with a longer bill, a skinnier neck, darker flanks, and a paler bill. These differences are more evident when both species are present, to allow for direct comparison. Not easily seen or identified from the lakeshore; a boat is usually needed for close-up views."
0,Junin Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus gettyae,https://ebird.org/species/juntap1,"Poorly known Peruvian endemic found only in high Andean cloud forest northeast of the city of Huancayo. It was described to science in 2013. Adult male is plain gray, lacking the rufous barring on the lower underparts shown by Rufous-vented Tapaculo and Trilling Tapaculo. Female plumage not yet known with certainty. Younger birds are heavily marked with bars or scales. Best identified by range and voice. Typical song is a lengthy series that starts out with simple notes and gradually transitions into sputtering bursts."
0,Juniper Titmouse,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paridae,Baeolophus ridgwayi,https://ebird.org/species/juntit1,"Possibly the plainest bird in North America—medium gray overall with no patterning. Despite dull plumage it is undeniably cute with a large eye and plain face. Crest is distinctive. Aptly named, they are found in dry juniper woodlands (and occasionally seen away from junipers). Visits bird feeders in the correct habitat."
0,Kabobo Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis kaboboensis,https://ebird.org/species/chtapa2,"A slender, plain slate-gray apalis with red-brown eyes, a pale belly, and a white-tipped tail; female is paler than the male. Juvenile more greenish-yellow than adult. One of Africa’s most poorly known birds, restricted to the Kabobo highlands in Democratic Republic of Congo, where it is resident in the canopy of tall montane forest between 1600 and 2500 meters of elevation. The voice is uncertain, but reported to be a dry buzzy trill like that of Chestnut-throated Apalis. The similar Gray Apalis differs from Kabobo in having a white, not gray, throat."
0,Kadavu Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura personata,https://ebird.org/species/kanfan1,"Mouse-brown above and white below. Head brown with a white throat above a variable black band. White stripe extends behind eye. Long tail is often fanned. Prefers forest habitats, especially along waterways.

0,Kai Cicadabird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Edolisoma dispar,https://ebird.org/species/kaicus1,"A thrush-sized songbird. Male is entirely glossy-black, while distinctive female has a gray head, a brown back, and a buff underside with extensive barring. Singles, pairs, or small groups inhabit the canopy of forests, edges, and woodlands, from lowlands into foothills. Sometimes joins mixed-species flocks. Differs from Black-faced Cuckooshrike in lacking a clearly demarcated black face. Male is smaller and slimmer-billed than Wallacean Cuckooshrike. Song is a low, three-note rasping “gek-grrrt-grrrt.” Also gives a high-pitched “whit” call."
0,Kakapo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Strigopidae,Strigops habroptila,https://ebird.org/species/kakapo2,"New Zealand’s largest endemic parrot. Flightless, nocturnal, and solitary, confined to several predator-free offshore islands. Adults have a moss-green coloring mottled with black and yellow on top. Shows gray legs, feet, and bill with a unique pale owl-like face. A solitary bird that forages on the ground and climbs trees at night. During the breeding season, males gather on lek-breeding “arenas,” a series of bowls and tracks where they give deep, resonating booming calls to attract females. Calls can carry several kilometers."
0,Kalahari Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cercotrichas paena,https://ebird.org/species/kasrob1,"A medium-sized sandy-brown scrub-robin with pale unstreaked underparts. It has a brownish back and an auburn-rusty rump and tail with a white-tipped black terminal band. Pairs frequent thickets and clumps of thorn trees in Kalahari woodland, where they forage on the ground with the tail often cocked and rocking sideways, or perch in trees singing a varied musical song that often reveals their presence. The similar Red-backed Scrub-Robin differs in having white on the wing and a streaked breast."
0,Kalij Pheasant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Lophura leucomelanos,https://ebird.org/species/kalphe,"A distinctive pheasant with bare red facial skin, a backward-pointing crest, and a vertically compressed tail. Males are iridescent black and silver. Females are grayish-brown. Coloration varies considerably throughout its range, with northeastern birds averaging the darkest. Occurs in forested areas, usually in hilly or mountainous regions. Overlaps with Silver Pheasant in the north of its range, with which it produces confusing intergrades. Native to South and Southeast Asia and introduced to the Hawaiian Islands of Hawaii and western Oahu. Males give a soft crow, other calls include low grunts and high-pitched squeals."
0,Kalkadoon Grasswren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Amytornis ballarae,https://ebird.org/species/kalgra1,"Small rusty-brown bird with finely streaked plumage and long cocked tail, found in rocky areas and gorges with spinifex clumps in the Mount Isa region of northwestern Queensland. Upperparts dark gray-brown, underparts rich gray, adult female with rich reddish-brown flanks, male with gray flanks. Usually seen scampering around on the ground on rocky ledges and among boulders. Much more solidly built than fairywrens, and with fine white streaks on head and chest."
0,Kamchatka Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus examinandus,https://ebird.org/species/arcwar2,"Small songbird, essentially identical in plumage to Arctic Warbler and Japanese Leaf Warbler. A late spring migrant, often moving up the Chinese coast from Southeast Asia in mid- to late May. Breeds in the taiga forests and forest edges of the Kamchatka peninsula, Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kuril Islands. Call is a low “chuck,” averaging lower than that of Japanese Leaf and Arctic Warblers. Song is a broken series of chattering notes, with each segment being in more discrete phrases than the more consistent, higher-pitched song of Arctic."
0,Kandt's Waxbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Estrilda kandti,https://ebird.org/species/kanwax1,"Pretty waxbill that is gray, black, and white, with red highlights. The bright red rump is conspicuous in flight. Found along forest edge and clearings, usually in grassy areas, in pairs or small flocks. The calls include high-pitched “tsik” and “tseet” notes which are often given in chorus by a flock, especially in flight. Similar to Black-crowned Waxbill, but darker and browner overall, with a black rather than white undertail."
0,Karamoja Apalis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Apalis karamojae,https://ebird.org/species/karapa1,"A slender ash-gray apalis with a striking diagnostic white panel on the folded wing and two pairs of white outer tail feathers which are usually obvious on the dark tail. Upperparts are darker than underparts. Presumably resident in areas of semi-arid shrubland, particularly those with scattered thorn trees along dry watercourses. Pairs sing a swaying musical duet, typically a repeated “dree-dooo-tee-too” for up to a minute, interspersed with other musical notes, buzzes, ticks, and trills."
0,Karoo Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Emarginata schlegelii,https://ebird.org/species/karcha1,"A large, slender, long-tailed gray chat with bold white outer tail feathers that frame the black tail. South African races are slaty gray with grayish rumps, while Namibian races are smaller and paler with whitish rumps. This is a bold chat that perches conspicuously on fences and shrubs throughout arid rangelands, dropping to the ground to forage before flying strongly and occasionally distantly to another perch, showing the diagnostic tail pattern. The Tractrac Chat is shorter-tailed, prefers hyper-arid barren environments, and has a distinctive V-shaped black wedge in the tail that the Karoo Chat lacks."
0,Karoo Long-billed Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Certhilauda subcoronata,https://ebird.org/species/klblar1,"A large, slender lark with a long, thin decurved bill and long legs. Features can be variable, but generally the species has rufous upperparts, grayish coloration on the back of the neck, and a lightly streaked chest. As the similar-looking long-billed larks have separate ranges, location is a key factor in identification. This species strides purposefully through dry open shrubland, running quickly before pausing to dig in soil or pick at a shrub for invertebrate prey, seeds, or fruit. In a characteristic display the male flies low to the ground before flying directly up 10 to 15 meters, and then closing its wings and plummeting toward the ground while typically emitting a two-note “hit-seeeoooouuu” whistle, the second note descending. This call and similar ones can also be given from the ground. Most larks in the same range are smaller and more compact, with smaller bills and shorter legs."
0,Karoo Prinia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Prinia maculosa,https://ebird.org/species/karpri1,"An active warbler with a long graduated tail that is sometimes cocked. It is dull brown above and pale below with extensive streaks and blotches on the underparts that often extend to the throat and belly. Pairs frequent fynbos, strandveld, Karoo shrublands, and gardens, where they are active gleaners of insects, occasionally hopping on the ground. The typical song is a reedy piping “kli” note repeated 4-15 times, with scratchy buzzing notes interspersed. The similar Drakensberg Prinia differs from the Karoo Prinia by having warmer upperparts, yellower underparts, and finer streaks that are mostly restricted to the chest."
0,Karoo Scrub-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cercotrichas coryphoeus,https://ebird.org/species/kasrob2,"A drab, gray-brown scrub-robin with bold white tail tips, eyebrow, and throat markings. Pairs are active and noisy in dry scrubby thickets and arid brush, where they vocalize prominently from the top of shrubs, fences, and rocks, or hop and run around on the ground, sometimes with their tails cocked. A scolding harsh contact call and warbler-like song draws attention to them. Other scrub-robins in the same range are more strikingly colored, and chats lack the white tail tips of Karoo Scrub-Robin."
0,Karoo Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus smithi,https://ebird.org/species/karthr1,"A typical mostly olive-brown thrush, with rufous coloration restricted to the center of the belly. It is most easily identified by range. Pairs occupy dense scrub and thickets in arid savanna and Karoo, grassland, and urban gardens on the South African highveld. The species gives a varied song and typical thrush “chk-chk” or thin “tseeep” calls. It is an understory specialist that sometimes skulks, but at other times can be quite bold. The similar Olive Thrush differs from Karoo Thrush in its rufous (not olive) flanks, its brown (not yellow-orange) eye-ring, its dark brown (not yellow) base to the upper mandible of the bill, and its streakier throat."
0,Kashmir Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula subrubra,https://ebird.org/species/kasfly1,"Stubby little flycatcher with a highly restricted range; breeds in a corner of the northwestern Himalayas and winters in isolated pockets of hill forest in southern India and Sri Lanka. Male is gray above and bright orange below; female is paler, with only a faint orange wash on the chest. Note white panels on each side of the black tail. Breeds in forests at 1800-2700 meters of elevation, favoring areas with dense undergrowth. Winters in forested edge areas, including orchards and gardens."
0,Kashmir Nutcracker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Nucifraga multipunctata,https://ebird.org/species/sponut1,"A jay-like bird with a long pointed bill, a black cap, and white spots all over. Very similar to Eurasian Nutcracker, but the Kashmir Nutcracker appears whiter overall with more white on the back, underparts, undertail, and tail tips. Forages in conifers for nuts and seeds, occasionally descending to the ground. Calls include loud, harsh “kraaa” notes."
0,Kashmir Nuthatch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sittidae,Sitta cashmirensis,https://ebird.org/species/kasnut1,"Unremarkable-looking nuthatch with a highly restricted range. Found in hill and montane forests; favors coniferous-dominated forest types. Slaty-gray with dark “extended mask” stripe and buffy-orange underparts (paler in female). Chestnut-bellied Nuthatch can be similar; note Kashmir’s pale throat, paler underparts, and unbarred vent in all plumages. Calls include a tortured-sounding nasal scream."
0,Katanga Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus katangae,https://ebird.org/species/kamwea1,"This red-eyed masked-weaver has a plain olive-green back and pink-brown legs. The breeding male has a black face mask, with the black band on the forehead above the bill varying from broad in the south to narrow farther north. Female and juvenile are dull and inseparable from other masked-weavers. Pairs and colonies are localized residents of reedbeds, wetlands and adjacent woodland, in a narrow global range between northeastern Zambia and southeastern DRC. The breeding males of Katanga and Southern masked-weavers are very similar, but the former are smaller, have some saffron around the masks, and have darker green backs and rumps; breeding male Tanganyika and Lake Lufira Masked-Weavers have more burnt-orange around the face and underparts, and ranges do not overlap."
0,Kauai Akialoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Akialoa stejnegeri,https://ebird.org/species/greaki4,"Extinct, last reported in 1969."
0,Kauai Amakihi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Chlorodrepanis stejnegeri,https://ebird.org/species/kauama,"An uncommon Hawaiian honeycreeper of forests on Kauai. Males are bright yellow and females are grayer. Larger and thicker-billed than amakihis on other islands. Occurs in native forest above 3,000 feet elevation in the understory and forest canopy where it searches for nectar, insects, and fruit. Song is a trill that does not change in pitch or speed. Call is a nasal “chee.”"
0,Kauai Elepaio,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Monarchidae,Chasiempis sclateri,https://ebird.org/species/elepai5,"A small flycatcher of forested habitats on Kauai. Adults have a gray back and white wingbars, while immatures are reddish brown with buffy wingbars. Common in native forest at higher elevations. Bold and curious; not afraid of people and may follow hikers. Often holds tail cocked up at an angle. Male song consists of two notes that rise and fall and have a squeaky, rubber ducky quality. Both sexes give a variety of soft calls and scolding notes. Responds to pishing and squeaking."
0,Negros Bleeding-heart,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Gallicolumba keayi,https://ebird.org/species/nebhea1,"A very rare medium-sized ground dove of foothill forest floor on Negros and Panay. Iridescent greenish-blue on the head and sides to the chest, scaled on the upper back, with brownish flight feathers. White underparts narrow from the throat down the chest to the belly. Obvious white crescents mark the wing and sides of the chest. Note the red “bleeding heart” in the center of the chest. Unlikely to be mistaken if seen well. The only other dove likely to flush from the ground would be Asian Emerald Dove. Song is a short, accelerating series of low notes."
0,Kelp Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Chloephaga hybrida,https://ebird.org/species/kelgoo1,"A distinctive goose found locally along rocky coasts and in intertidal areas; very rarely away from the shoreline. Usually in pairs or small groups, readily associating with other geese. Pure white male stands out at long range, but handsomely patterned female can be cryptic—note her white tail, pale brown cap. First-year males are variably intermediate in plumage between adult males and females. In flight, females show bold black-and-white wing pattern like other austral geese such as Upland Goose."
0,Kelp Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Larus dominicanus,https://ebird.org/species/kelgul,"Large dark-backed gull. Few similar species in much of its range. Usually coastal. Adults have black backs and wings with very little white in the flight feathers. The bill is very strong and robust and the legs are greenish-yellow. Juveniles have a dark brown back mottled with white, a black bill, and a dark band on the tail."
0,Kemp's Longbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Macrosphenidae,Macrosphenus kempi,https://ebird.org/species/kemlon1,"An unusual warbler with a long bill and pale eye. The upperparts are pale, with blurry gray on the chest and rufous on the flanks. Found in humid forest at low and middle elevations, mainly in dense mid-level tangles. Similar in appearance to other longbills, but with a good view, separated by the rufous on the underparts. Also similar to Fraser’s Sunbird, but less yellow below, with a straighter bill. Most often detected by the distinctive song, a melancholy, wandering, variable series of whistles that can either descend or ascend. Sounds quite robin-like."
0,Kenrick's Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Poeoptera kenricki,https://ebird.org/species/kensta1,"A small, slim dark starling. The eyes are brown, and females show chestnut patches in the wings in flight. Found in the canopy of montane forest, mostly at middle elevations, usually in small flocks which frequently gather at fruiting trees. Perches out conspicuously on dead snags and other open perches. Similar to Waller’s Starling, but smaller and slimmer, with brown rather than red eyes, and only females have reddish wing patches. Very similar to Stuhlmann’s Starling, but separated by range. The most common call is a simple “tweep.” Also gives a subdued chattering."
0,Kentish Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius alexandrinus,https://ebird.org/species/kenplo1,"Small, pale plover with broken black collar, sandy upperparts, grayish legs, and rather fine black bill. Breeding plumage has black mask and black tabs at sides of breast (not a complete band). Nonbreeding plumages have black replaced by brown.

0,Kentucky Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Geothlypis formosa,https://ebird.org/species/kenwar,"Shy warbler of deciduous forest with thick understory. Often found in swampy areas or near slow-moving streams. Bright yellow below with olive back. Telltale black mask set off by yellow spectacles and throat. All plumages show face pattern; adult males boldest with black crown, females and immatures duller with grayish or olive crown. In the breeding season, more often heard than seen. Song is a series of 4-8 loud, rich, rolling notes ""preet, preet, preet, preet."" Can perch high when singing, otherwise stays near the ground."
0,Kenya Rufous Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer rufocinctus,https://ebird.org/species/kerspa2,"A typical sparrow with a striped back, a gray crown and nape, and a dark bib. The rufous rump is conspicuous in flight. The sexes are similar, though males have a bolder black bib and more rufous on the face. Both sexes have a pale eye. Generally common in savanna, in cultivated areas, and around human habitation. Very similar to Shelley’s Rufous Sparrow, but not known to overlap in range, and separated by the pale eye.

0,Kerguelen Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Aphrodroma brevirostris,https://ebird.org/species/kerpet2,"Dark ash-gray petrel of cold southern seas. Small- and stout-bodied overall, but with a large, “puffy”-looking head. Note underwing patterning, with a pale “shoulder” separated from pale-based primaries by a broad, diffuse dark bar. Flies quickly and strongly, often arcing up to impressive heights above the waves on angled, sharply kinked wings. Can be difficult to distinguish from other dark medium-sized petrels at a distance, but note pale patches under the wings, overall gray body coloration, relatively large “cute” head, and flight style. Often forages at night. Nests in loose colonies on the Prince Edward, Crozet, and Kerguelen Islands, as well as Gough Island."
0,Kerguelen Shag,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Phalacrocoracidae,Leucocarbo verrucosus,https://ebird.org/species/kersha1,"An attractive Southern Ocean crested and pied cormorant with pinkish feet, orange-buff warty caruncles on forehead, and a blue eye-ring, but without white wingbars. Juvenile is duller, lacking facial ornaments. Restricted to a single subantarctic island, Kerguelen, where it is the only cormorant and is commonly seen foraging in inshore waters. Although they do not overlap in range, most other Southern Ocean “blue-eyed” shags are larger, with whiter sides to the head, and many have white wingbars. Call is a grunting wheeze."
0,Kerguelen Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sterna virgata,https://ebird.org/species/kerter1,"A slender tern with a short bill. Breeding adults are dark-capped with an ashy-gray body, a strongly contrasting white cheek stripe and rump, and a reddish bill and legs. In flight, underwings and uppertail are mostly grayish. In non-breeding plumage resembles other non-breeding terns, but note structure. Restricted to a handful of subantarctic islands, where it forages in inshore waters; common on Kerguelen and uncommon on Crozet and Marion. In breeding plumage, the larger Antarctic Tern is paler gray than Kerguelen, with a larger bill and whitish (not grayish) uppertail and underwings. Arctic Terns (in non-breeding plumage) only overlap with Kerguelen Terns (in breeding plumage) in austral summer."
0,Kermadec Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma neglecta,https://ebird.org/species/kerpet,"Fairly large and thickset petrel of offshore tropical and subtropical waters across the Pacific; not seen from mainland. Plumage is highly variable (white-bodied and white-headed, dark-headed, or wholly dark), but all types have a white flash on the wingtip, including diagnostic white feather shafts on upperwing, which enhance this petrel’s resemblance to jaegers and skuas. Indeed, sometimes Kermadec Petrels chase and pirate other petrels, as do jaegers and skuas. Herald Petrel is very similar, but is smaller and slimmer with a longer and more tapered tail, and lacks white shafts on upperwings."
0,Killdeer,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius vociferus,https://ebird.org/species/killde,"Common, large plover. Slender shape with long wings and tail. Look for two black breast bands, unique among plovers in its range. Often nests near human development: parking lots, school roofs, road edges, and farms, usually on bare gravel. Adults perform broken-wing displays to distract predators from their nests and young. Gathers in larger numbers in migration and winter, often in fields with short grass or barren dirt. Occurs throughout North America; more local along the Pacific coast of northern South America. Can be very vocal; listen for loud namesake “kill-deer” call."
0,Kilombero Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus burnieri,https://ebird.org/species/kilwea1,"A fairly small and slim weaver with a relatively slender bill. Breeding male is distinctive, with bright yellow overall plumage and a black-and-chestnut bib. Females and non-breeding males are much duller, but show streaking on the back and usually a pale base to the dark bill. Found in a small range in central Tanzania, in reedbeds along rivers, often in flocks. Nests colonially. Plumages other than the breeding male’s can be hard to separate from other weavers, especially Vitelline Masked-Weaver, but can be cautiously identified by their dark back, by their less yellow overall coloration, and by range. Vocalizations are typical of weavers: “chek” notes and a sizzling “radio static” song."
0,Kimberley Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Territornis fordiana,https://ebird.org/species/kimhon1,"Medium-sized honeyeater found in sandstone escarpment and gorge country of the western Kimberley region. Upperparts uniformly gray-green, underparts pale with diffuse gray streaks on chest. Dark cheeks split by thin pale gape mark that extends upward under the blue eye. Calls include loud short whistled phrases."
0,King Eider,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Somateria spectabilis,https://ebird.org/species/kineid,"A fantastic sea duck of the high Arctic. Breeding male is particularly shocking, as if you left a child unsupervised with a set of paints; it would be very difficult to mistake this bird for anything else. At a distance, look for black back with “sails” sticking up, powdery-blue nape, and enormous orange knob on the face. Immature male is variable but usually dark brown or blackish overall with paler breast and orange bill. Female is buffy-brown with a blackish bill shaped to look like she’s smiling. Extensive breeding range across the Arctic tundra; winters at slightly lower latitudes, rarely as far south as the mid-Atlantic states of the U.S. Most often seen singly or in small flocks on the ocean, often mixed with Common Eider or other sea ducks. Rare on inland lakes, but more regular inland than Common Eider. Females and young males more regularly seen further south than adult males."
0,King Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Aptenodytes patagonicus,https://ebird.org/species/kinpen1,"Large, spectacular, and basically unmistakable penguin that is rarely seen away from well-known colony sites. The long and stout bill distinguishes King from the even larger but shorter-billed Emperor Penguin, which is a true Antarctic species, rarely seen far from ice. Also note the golden neck patches (can fade to whitish on immatures) and pink bill base (bill starts out black on immature). Breeding season requires more than a year, so birds can be seen year-round at colonies."
0,King Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus elegans,https://ebird.org/species/kinrai4,"Large, bright rail of freshwater marshes. Generally uncommon to rare across range. Note rich orange neck and face, contrasty black-and-white barring on sides, and rich brownish upperparts with distinct dark streaks. Females are duller than males. Very similar to Clapper Rail, especially on the Gulf Coast. Habitat is a good first clue: King prefers freshwater marshes with extensive cattails or other reeds; rarely found in brackish or saltwater marshes like Clapper. King is also brighter overall with more contrasting pattern on the sides and upperparts. Beware that King and Clapper can hybridize where fresh and saltwater meet; some birds are best left unidentified. Listen for series of harsh ""kek"" notes or loud, rasping grunts erupting from marsh, slower and deeper than Clapper Rail."
0,King Vulture,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cathartiformes,Cathartidae,Sarcoramphus papa,https://ebird.org/species/kinvul1,"Uncommon, large, and spectacular bird of lowland tropical forest, mainly in wilder areas and not around human habitation. Most often seen soaring overhead in mid-late morning, often fairly high up with kettles of Black Vultures; rarely seen perched. Striking adult has a colorful head and neck, piercing white eyes, and mostly white plumage with a black trailing edge to the wings and tail. Immature is blackish overall and lacks the white wing markings of the smaller Black Vulture. Immature develops adult plumage over a few years with white appearing first on the belly and the underside of the wings."
0,Kinglet Calyptura,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Calyptura cristata,https://ebird.org/species/kincal1,"One of Earth’s rarest and most sought-after birds. It inhabits humid forest in the coastal mountains of southeastern Brazil, and may now be extinct. Apart from a series of sightings in October 1996 near Teresópolis in the state of Rio de Janeiro, this tiny and colorful bird has not been reliably documented since the 1800s. Recent unverified reports have also come from other areas in the coastal range in the neighboring state of São Paulo. Plumage is mostly yellowish-olive, with a fiery red crest bordered by a black stripe, and white wingbars. Other features include a very short bill, white tips to the inner wing feathers, and a yellow rump that is usually hidden by the wings. The few living observers have reported that it tended to perch in treetops with a notably vertical posture. Its voice is unknown."
0,Kinglet Manakin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pipridae,Machaeropterus regulus,https://ebird.org/species/strman2,"Chunky little, short-tailed bird of lowland and foothill forest. Male is distinctive with bright red crown and bold white stripes on reddish belly. Female lacks red crown but shows faint streaking on sides unlike any other manakin. Inconspicuous; elaborate display dance infrequently seen. Found in the lower to middle levels of forest. Listen for its strong “chew” call."
0,Kioea,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Mohoidae,Chaetoptila angustipluma,https://ebird.org/species/kioea,"Extinct, last reported in 1900."
0,Kirtland's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga kirtlandii,https://ebird.org/species/kirwar,"One of the largest and rarest warblers. Breeds only in young jack pine forests in northern Michigan and Wisconsin. Winters in the Bahamas; seldom seen in migration. Blue-gray above and lemon-yellow below with broken white eye-ring, thin white wingbars, and black spotting on sides. Female slightly browner than male. Constantly pumps tail up and down. Most similar to drab female or immature Magnolia Warbler but larger with gray (not greenish) back and tail-pumping behavior. Also compare with Canada Warbler, which has bold black streaks across breast and bold yellow spectacles."
0,Kittlitz's Murrelet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Alcidae,Brachyramphus brevirostris,https://ebird.org/species/kitmur,"Small, oblong-shaped seabird. Breeding plumage mottled brown; darkness varies, but often shows golden tint. Nonbreeding plumage dark gray above and white below, with a white face and large white wing patch. Nests in crevices in rocky scree slopes, particularly around glaciers; forages in coastal glacial outflows. Similar to Marbled and Long-billed Murrelets, but with shorter bill and white outer tail feathers; breeding birds average paler with speckled back, while nonbreeders show white on face extending above the eye."
0,Kittlitz's Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius pecuarius,https://ebird.org/species/kitplo1,"Small plover with a brown back and pale underparts. Distinctive head pattern, with one black stripe behind the eye and another across the forehead. Found on mudflats, on saltpans, and in open fields, sometimes far from water. Generally most common along the coast, though locally common inland. Acts like a typical plover, running and plucking food from the ground. Bold head pattern and lack of chest bands separate adults from other plovers. Plainer juveniles can be confusing, but are smaller than White-fronted and Caspian Plovers."
0,Klaas's Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Chrysococcyx klaas,https://ebird.org/species/klacuc1,"A small, greenish cuckoo. The male has plain white underparts and glossy green upperparts; note dark spurs that extend from the head down onto the lower throat, as well as conspicuous white patch behind the eye. The female is barred with greenish-bronze on the back; her head is gray-brown; and her underparts are barred brown-and-white. It eats caterpillars and larvae, and its preferred brood-parasite hosts are batises, small warblers, and sunbirds. A fairly common resident and migrant, it is much more conspicuous when incessantly repeating its plaintive “meeee-jtie, meeee-tjie” call."
0,Klages's Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Drymophila klagesi,https://ebird.org/species/klaant2,"Stunning small bird with long, white-tipped tail. Head, back and breast streaked black-and-white in male; female also streaked but back and crown are rufous. Both sexes show rufous rump and belly. Wings have contrasting white spots and wingbars. Often in pairs in bamboo thickets or at edges of montane forest. Hard to see but easy to hear, raspy song starting with two strong peeps followed by two or three longer, wheezy notes. No similar species in range."
0,Klages's Antwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Myrmotherula klagesi,https://ebird.org/species/klaant1,"Tiny, compact antwren with a short tail. Males are gray and heavily streaked black. Females are similar but have an ochraceous tinge. Found in the canopy of seasonally flooded forests and on forested river islands. The song is a repetition of double notes: “teWic.” The male of Amazonian Streaked Antwren is rather similar but has a semi-concealed white back patch."
0,Kloss's Leaf Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Phylloscopidae,Phylloscopus ogilviegranti,https://ebird.org/species/klolew1,"Unlike “Blyth’s-type” leaf warblers, the similarly-sized but somewhat stouter Kloss’s and Davison’s leaf warblers flick both of their wings at the same time. A brightly-marked leaf warbler with a yolk-yellow brow and crown stripe, and a pale-yellow vent which contrasts with the white breast and belly. Wing bars are also yellow and average stronger than those of Claudia’s, Blyth’s, and Hartert’s warblers. Yellow vent and strong crown stripe may cause confusion with Eastern Crowned Warbler when the latter is migrating, but look for the relatively small, stubby bill and the strong double wing bars of Kloss’s."
0,Knobbed Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Rhyticeros cassidix,https://ebird.org/species/knohor1,"A huge black hornbill with a prominent knob on the bill, conspicuous red “gills” on the sides of the beak, a turquoise-blue throat pouch, and a white tail. Males have a red casque and rufous neck, females a yellow knob and black neck. Juveniles resemble male, but with an entirely yellow casqueless bill. Found in pairs or groups in canopy of forested and wooded areas of lowlands and hills. Larger and more colorful than Sulawesi Hornbill. Gives powerful, short “krok” notes and a more drawn-out “oooo-aa-ooo-aaa.”"
0,Knysna Turaco,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Musophagiformes,Musophagidae,Tauraco corythaix,https://ebird.org/species/knytur1,"A long-tailed, bulky, green bird that bounces agilely through evergreen forest canopies in pairs or small groups. In flight it explodes from the canopy with distinctive deep red panels in the wings. A harsh repeated, croaking “khaaar-khaaar-khaar” often reveals its presence. Knysna Turaco has a rounded, white tipped crest, unlike the pointed crest of the similar Livingstone’s Turaco. Purple-crested Turaco is much darker on the body."
0,Knysna Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus sylvaticus,https://ebird.org/species/knswar1,"A skulky, dark olive-brown warbler with a graduated tail and plain dark underparts (sometimes with fine streaking). It creeps around mouse-like in thick undergrowth and tangles in forest, forest edge, and coastal thickets. It is frequently detected and identified by its song, mostly delivered between August and November, which comprises a series of accelerating “tslip” notes that culminate in a reedy trill. The similar Barratt’s Warbler differs from Knysna Warbler by its longer tail, paler underparts, more pronounced throat streaking, and different song."
0,Knysna Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campethera notata,https://ebird.org/species/knywoo1,"A furtive woodpecker with densely spotted underparts and face. The male has a reddish crown and moustache; the female has a faint dark moustache and dark crown marked red only toward the back of the head. Pairs inhabit forest, forest edge, thickets, and plantations, moving slowly and deliberately while foraging for insects. Often prefers smaller branches in thick scrub where it remains well hidden, infrequently giving a distinctive shrill single note “pleeiiee.” Does not drum."

Underparts are pale, with diffuse tawny streaks on the breast. The tail is tricolored, mostly blackish with golden-rufous central feathers and white outer feathers, conspicuous in flight. Movements are poorly known, but small groups are partial migrants and nomads in scrubby semi-desert on reddish sands with grass. Vocalizations are poorly known, but one recording suggests varied whistles, churrs, and tweets, including imitations, and an aerial display. Kordofan is easily confused with the very similar Dunn’s Lark, which is paler, lacks breast streaking, and has a uniform pinkish horn-colored bill."
0,Kordofan Rufous Sparrow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Passeridae,Passer cordofanicus,https://ebird.org/species/korspa1,"A typical sparrow with a striped back, a gray crown and back of the neck, and a dark bib. There is rufous on the eye stripe, back, and rump. The sexes are similar, though males are brighter overall and show a blacker and more distinct bib. Found locally in dry thorn savanna and cultivated areas, sometimes around human habitation. Similar to House Sparrow, but easily separated by the bright rufous in the plumage. The call is a cheerful “chirp,” similar to that of other sparrows."

0,Lapland Longspur,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Calcariidae,Calcarius lapponicus,https://ebird.org/species/laplon,"Sparrowlike ground-dweller; crouches low to the ground and walks with pattering footsteps. Breeding male is gorgeous and unmistakable: yellow bill, black face, broad white eyebrow, and bright rufous nape unlike any other bird. Females and nonbreeding birds are much more subtle. Habitat and habits provide good clues: often in flocks in winter, sometimes mixed with Horned Larks or Snow Buntings, on barren landscapes such as beaches or dirt fields. To separate from other longspurs, look for combination of face pattern, rufous nape, and rufous wing panel with white tips. Breeds on Arctic tundra, where males sing a tinkling warble. Can also be heard giving ""teew"" notes and rattle calls like Snow Buntings and other longspurs."
0,Large Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis magnirostris,https://ebird.org/species/larblf1,"Typical blue flycatcher; male is bright blue above and orange below, while female is grayish-brown above with a light orange suffusion on her pale belly. Breeds in eastern Himalayan foothill forests and winters in more open habitat in lowlands of Thai-Malay peninsula. Combination of orange throat, long broad bill, and extensive orange on underparts (stretching from the throat down to the belly) serve to distinguish male from other similar species. Dull female is lighter-colored and has a paler throat than similar Chinese Blue-Flycatcher. Closely related Hill Blue Flycatcher is extremely similar and identification may be safer when based on range; visually, look for Large Blue’s slightly larger bill with a more pronounced hooked tip, paler throat in relation to the chest, and paler pinkish legs. Gives a high, sweet song with harsh rattling notes interspersed; averages longer than similar song of Hill Blue Flycatcher."
0,Large Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Coracina macei,https://ebird.org/species/larcus1,"A large gray cuckooshrike with a strong, hooked bill. Upperparts are mostly gray with black primaries; male darker than female. Rump and upper tail are paler than back, which is apparent in flight. Male has gray throat and upper breast becoming white in the belly with some gray bars. Female has white underparts with dark gray bars except from the lower belly to the tail. Both sexes have a dark patch from the bill to slightly behind the eye, giving a masked impression. Juvenile is brownish, heavily scaled with whitish-buff, and mottled on the underparts. Immature has broader white edges to wing feathers. Vocal. Call is a two-noted, rather nasal “gii-yaak,” uttered in flight as well as from a perch. Inhabits lightly wooded country, avoiding wet forests."
0,Large Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia spectabilis,https://ebird.org/species/larela1,"Medium-sized migratory flycatcher found at forest edges, in second growth, and along streams. As with other elaenia species, it has an olive-brown back and yellowish belly. Note the three wingbars and short crest. Very similar to Yellow-bellied Elaenia, but it is larger and has smaller crest with no white and three (not two) wingbars. The song is a loud whistle while the dawn song is series of “twee-wee-tweet” notes."
0,Large Fig-Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Psittaculirostris desmarestii,https://ebird.org/species/lafpar1,"A medium-sized, chunky parrot of forest from the lowlands to the mid-mountains. Reddish forehead, orange crown, yellow cheek and blue or purple band across the chest. Races differ and considered separate species by some. Similar-sized Edward’s & Salvadori’s Fig-Parrots not thought to co-occur, but Large Fig-Parrot has an orange rather than green crown. Somewhat similar to Double-eyed Fig-Parrot, but Large Fig-Parrot is larger and has yellow-orange cheek and a breast band. Fairly vocal. Call, a sharp, loud “tshek!” or sharp, slurred phrase sounding like a rusty-hinged door."
0,Large Frogmouth,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Podargidae,Batrachostomus auritus,https://ebird.org/species/larfro1,"Sizeable nightbird with deep black eyes and wispy pale whiskers above its eyes that give it the appearance of a distinguished professor. Warm, pale, brown overall with bright white spots on the wings. Despite its size, this lowland rainforest giant can be cryptic and difficult to find; roosts under cover by day and hunts from a perch by night.

0,Large Ground-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Geospiza magnirostris,https://ebird.org/species/lagfin1,"A large Galápagos finch with a bulky bill. Bill typically appears bulbous, showing a ridge along the upper edge that juts up where it meets the crown feathers. Bill is black on breeding male and dull orange on female and nonbreeding male. Adult male’s plumage is sooty-black; female is brown with paler underparts that are streaked with gray. Medium Ground-Finch has smaller, shallower bill lacking ridge along the top. However, bill size varies among individuals, and not all birds can be confidently identified. Common in arid habitats near the coast, and scarce in the highlands. Found on most islands, but absent from Baltra, Santa Fé, San Cristóbal, Española, Darwin, and Wolf. Formerly occurred on Floreana, but there are no recent records."
0,Large Niltava,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Niltava grandis,https://ebird.org/species/larnil1,"Typical niltava: male bright blue, female plain brown. Male is bright electric purplish-blue above and very dark blue below. Female is dark brown with rusty tones in the wings and an iridescent blue patch on the neck. Southeast Asian females have a pale powder-blue crown and nape. Lack of a bright white throat patch separates female from female Rufous-bellied and Fujian Niltavas. Small Niltava is similar in plumage, but much smaller and less heavyset. Male White-tailed Robin can be surprisingly similar but is proportionally smaller-headed and larger-bodied and has a wider tail with two bright white patches on it.

Habitat and behavior are helpful supporting clues, too. Typically forages in a crouched posture with bent legs, picking for invertebrates in the mud. Often in small loose groups, but not in large, tight flocks like Semipalmated or Western Sandpipers. Prefers drier mud, often on the higher edges of mudflats or small patches of water in marshes. Widespread and common, especially inland. Breeds in various wetland habitats throughout Alaska and Canada. Winters from the southern U.S. to South America. Listen for high-pitched, rolling “greeep!” calls."
0,Least Seedsnipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Thinocoridae,Thinocorus rumicivorus,https://ebird.org/species/leasee1,"Very small but stocky, quail-like bird of Patagonian steppe, sandy and stony plains in the Andes, coastal dunes, and deserts. Found in pairs or small groups; locally large flocks in nonbreeding season. Male has hooting song given from low mounds or fence posts, and sometimes during display flight. Flight is strong and fast; flushes with loud bleating chatters. Similar Gray-breasted Seedsnipe is larger, favors rockier Andean habitats, and has plain gray breast without diagnostic black Y pattern present on male Least Seedsnipes."
0,Least Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates microsoma,https://ebird.org/species/lsspet,"Very small, all-dark storm-petrel with a fairly short, graduated tail. Fairly common and can be seen from shore in the Gulf of California and along the Pacific coast. Often feeds and associates with the much larger Black Storm-Petrel, where size difference is obvious. Flight of Least is generally quick and weaving, with deep, rather jerky wingbeats and little or no gliding."
0,Least Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sternula antillarum,https://ebird.org/species/leater1,"Tiny tern with quick flicking wingbeats. A real beach bum, rarely straying far from sand, both on the coast and along inland rivers and lakes. Breeding adults have yellow bill, stumpy yellow feet, white forehead, and black cap. Nonbreeding and immatures have a black bill, blackish nape, and dark shoulder bar, but still always identifiable by size and quick wingbeats. Often seen with other terns. Listen for shrill high-pitched calls."
0,Lemon Dove,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Columbiformes,Columbidae,Columba larvata,https://ebird.org/species/lemdov2,"Dark, medium-sized dove with a pale face. Shows paler gray corners of the tail in flight. Varies geographically; most eastern and southern African birds have rufous underparts, while western and central African birds are gray below. Shy understory species that is most often seen on the ground inside thick forest. Often not noticed until it noisily flies away. Call is a deep hoot, usually delivered in a slow series, though sometimes in a quick series. Similar to Delegorgue’s and Bronze-naped pigeons but inhabits the understory and has a pale face."
0,Lesser Antillean Bullfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Loxigilla noctis,https://ebird.org/species/leabul1,"A tame and often conspicuous resident of thickets and tangles in a wide variety of habitats. Males are black with a red throat and vent, and females are buff and gray with rust on the wings and vent. The male is similar to the St. Lucia Black Finch, which has pale legs rather than black and lacks the Lesser Antillean Bullfinch’s red throat and vent. The female could be mistaken for a St. Lucia Black Finch or a female Black-faced Grassquit. The female black finch has a gray rather than brown crown and has pale (not dark) legs. Female grassquits are olive, not brown above and are smaller. The typical song is a series of three to seven “wheet” notes. Common calls include “chuk” and “tseet.”"
0,Lesser Antillean Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Myiarchus oberi,https://ebird.org/species/leafly1,"An inconspicuous, relatively tame, medium-sized flycatcher of woodlands and tall scrub. Typically perches motionless below the canopy of the tree before sallying forth in pursuit of prey. Distinguished from similar species within its range by combination of gray chest, yellow belly, and rust-brown undertail. Often first detected by its plaintive, drawn out “pheee” or “pheeuuu” song. Also makes a variety of “pip” and rolling trill calls."
0,Lesser Antillean Pewee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Contopus latirostris,https://ebird.org/species/leapew1,"A small drab flycatcher of woodlands including, at times, mangrove swamps. This species is dull brown above and yellow-buff to orange-buff below. Adults lack wingbars and eyering, but immatures have dull buff wingbars. The tertial edges are typically quite bright, forming narrow stripes on the posterior folded wing. The Caribbean Elaenia is passingly similar but has bold wingbars and a gray eyebrow. Vocalizations include a whistled “peee-oo” followed by a low whistled trill and “pee-ooooo,” with the first syllable a clear whistle and the second a low-whistled trill. Also, commonly utters a sharp “pee.”"
0,Lesser Antillean Saltator,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Saltator albicollis,https://ebird.org/species/leasal1,"A small to medium-sized, olive-colored inhabitant of thickets, scrub, and other low dense habitats. A distinctive species with a stout black-and-yellow bill, a pale throat, and a pale eyebrow. No similar species occur within its range. Its song is a series of loud musical notes that rise and fall. Call notes include faint “tsi” and sharp “chink.”"
0,Lesser Antillean Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Chaetura martinica,https://ebird.org/species/leaswi1,"An aerial feeder that is typically found over highland forests in flocks of up to forty birds; sometimes feeds at lower altitudes, particularly during inclement weather. Its stubby dark-gray body and rapid, shallow wingbeats eliminates all swallows. Short-tailed Swift is similar, but has a gray vent and gray rump, which contrasts more markedly against its dark body than Lesser Antillean Swift. Very rarely found when not flying. Call is a high, sharp twitter."
0,Lesser Antillean Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Stilpnia cucullata,https://ebird.org/species/leatan1,"A brightly colored small woodland species often found in pairs or small flocks at fruiting trees. Note the dark partial hood and striking turquoise wings. No other species in its range shares these characters. Song consists of a series of high, thin notes followed by a high-pitched jumbled twitter."
0,Lesser Adjutant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Ciconiiformes,Ciconiidae,Leptoptilos javanicus,https://ebird.org/species/lesadj1,"A large stork with a completely bare head and neck ideal for its scavenging habits. The adult’s face is red and the neck is yellow while the juvenile has a brownish head and a white, thinly-feathered neck. The upperparts are all dark while the underparts are mostly white. In flight, note the broad wings with distinctive white “armpits” and tucked in neck. Similar to the larger Greater Adjutant; Lesser has a more slender bill, has all-dark upperwings, and often adopts a more upright, less “hunched” posture. Often found in shallow marshes, fields, and swamps."
0,Lesser Akialoa,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Akialoa obscura,https://ebird.org/species/lesaki,"Extinct, last reported in 1940."
0,Lesser Coucal,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Centropus bengalensis,https://ebird.org/species/lescou1,"A dark, rather sturdy cuckoo of scrubby habitats, reedbeds, forest edge, and agricultural areas. Adults black with bright chestnut wings and fine silvery streaking on neck and shoulders. Immatures a grayish brown above, paler below, with dull chestnut wings and a brown-and-black barred tail. Similar to Greater Coucal but significantly smaller, with a dark (instead of red) eye and duller chestnut back and wings with silver streaks. Song is a distinctive series of sharp notes, with the crescendo cadence of a bouncing ball."
0,Lesser Crested Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Thalasseus bengalensis,https://ebird.org/species/lecter2,"Elegant medium-sized tern with a slender yellow-orange bill and black crown. Can be confused with Great Crested Tern; note proportionally longer, more orangey bill on Lesser Crested. Also note gray upperwing, which separates it from Sandwich Tern. Gray rump and tail are diagnostic if seen well. On juveniles, note dull legs, secondaries with dark centers, and a weakly patterned upperwing. Strictly coastal, usually found on beaches and estuaries. Call a noisy “kerrrick.”"
0,Lesser Ground-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Morococcyx erythropygus,https://ebird.org/species/legcuc1,"Furtive and rarely seen, but loud song carries well and sounds like a referee’s whistle being blown faster and then slower. Inhabits brushy dry woodland in tropical lowlands, where most of the time it walks stealthily on the ground. When alarmed it usually freezes offering good views—if you are lucky. Note the boldly colored turquoise and yellow skin around the eye and the warm buffy or cinnamon-colored underparts."
0,Lesser Cuckooshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Campephagidae,Lalage fimbriata,https://ebird.org/species/lescus1,"Medium-sized gray bird (small for a cuckooshrike) with considerable geographic variation. Male averages darkest on the wings, throat, and breast, contrasting more heavily with the rest of the plumage than in the fairly uniform-looking male Indochinese Cuckooshrike. Female is pale gray with fine barring on the underparts. Undertail is black with white-tipped feathers concentrated at the end of the tail; does not appear as evenly graduated as in the larger Black-winged Cuckooshrike, and is less extensively white-tailed than Indochinese Cuckooshrike. Forages in the upper levels of forests and forest edge in lowland and hilly areas, often as part of mixed-species flocks. Song begins with a few clear tinkling notes, then transitions into a loud, insistent “jeh, jeh, jeh, jeh”."
0,Lesser Elaenia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Elaenia chiriquensis,https://ebird.org/species/lesela1,"Confusing flycatcher, fairly small and nondescript. Like many other elaenias and flycatchers, brownish-olive above, pale gray on the throat, and pale yellow on the belly, with whitish wingbars. Only shows a slight crest and very little facial pattern. Usually seen in more open habitats like forest edge or second growth, singly or in pairs, sometimes following a mixed-species flock. Best identified by voice, which varies across range. Call is typically a single high-pitched “pseew”, sometimes buzzy and sometimes clear. Also gives a harsh stuttered song, varying from a short “chi-bur” to a longer series of notes."
0,Lesser Fish-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Haliaeetus humilis,https://ebird.org/species/lefeag1,"Gray-brown eagle with piercing yellow eyes and an immaculate white belly. Juvenile paler and browner than adult, with weakly streaked underparts. Most easily separated from larger Gray-headed Fish-Eagle in flight: note Lesser’s “dirtier” tail with a less contrasting black band and more mottled underwings in adult; note overall paler underside patterning in juvenile. White belly also tends to have a more poorly-defined and jagged shape than the sharp “V” of Gray-headed. Favors faster-flowing foothill streams and rivers, but can also be found in lowland lakes and wetlands."
0,Lesser Flamingo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Phoenicopteriformes,Phoenicopteridae,Phoeniconaias minor,https://ebird.org/species/lesfla1,The smallest flamingo in the world with a long and very dark tricolored bill and red legs. Juvenile are gray brown and darker than Greater Flamingos. Found in inland alkaline lakes where gathers in huge flocks to breed and eat microscopic blue-green algae at a few widely-spaced colonies. Makes extensive movements in response to changing environmental conditions.
0,Lesser Florican,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Sypheotides indicus,https://ebird.org/species/lesflo2,"Small and gracile bustard of grasslands, scrubby fields, and select agricultural matrices. Male is striking: black with pale wings and a filamentous crest. Light brown female is less eye-catching, but her size and shape set her apart from other similar species. Difficult to detect in tall vegetation; male’s crazy courtship dance puts him in view during the breeding season."
0,Lesser Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata ariel,https://ebird.org/species/lesfri,"The smallest of the frigatebirds, but note that the female is larger than the male. Adults are easier to identify than younger birds. Adult males are almost entirely black with a red throat and white spurs emanating outwards from the body onto the wing. Adult females have a black belly and throat, a white breast and hind collar, with similar white spurs on their sides. Juvenile and immature plumages are variable and are best separated from other frigatebirds by size when comparison is possible. Mostly silent except while breeding in oceanic islands. Strongly pelagic during non-breeding season but wind-blown or fatigued birds can be found from continental coasts."
0,Lesser Goldfinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Spinus psaltria,https://ebird.org/species/lesgol,"Tiny yellowish finch. Blackish conical bill is stout, but sharply pointed. Long wings are black with one white wingbar and large white patch at the base of the primaries. Small head. Short notched tail. Adult males have either green or black (Texas to South America) back. Regularly visits feeders. Females similar to American Goldfinch; note bill shape and color, usually more yellowish undertail coverts, less distinct wingbars, and more obvious white patch at base of primaries."
0,Lesser Grass-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Emberizoides ypiranganus,https://ebird.org/species/lesgrf1,Large finch with a long spiky tail and strong yellow bill. It is yellow-brown above with dark lines running down the back and pale buff below with a gray face and a white throat. Differs from Wedge-tailed Grass-finch in having a white rather than buff throat. Usually found in marshes and humid grasslands. The song is a harsh “ch-ch-ch-ch.”
0,Lesser Green Leafbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Chloropseidae,Chloropsis cyanopogon,https://ebird.org/species/leglea1,"Male and females are bright green overall, but the male has a black-and-blue throat while the female sometimes shows a slight yellow tinge to the throat. The Lesser Green Leafbird is very similar in appearance to the Greater Green Leafbird, but note that the male Lesser Green Leafbird has a smaller black mask and traces of yellow on the forehead. Lack of blue traces in the wings distinguishes this species from the otherwise similar Blue-winged and Bornean Leafbirds. Inhabits lowland primary and secondary broadleaf evergreen forests, as well as adjacent plantations and large parks. Joins mixed-species foraging flocks, usually in the canopy."
0,Lesser Greenlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Pachysylvia decurtata,https://ebird.org/species/lesgre1,"Small plain vireo of tropical forest and woodland in lowlands. Usually stays fairly high in trees and likely to be overlooked unless its rather tuneless, monotonously repeated song is learned. Identified by a combination its gray head (in Mexico and Central America) with a diffuse whitish eyering; whitish underparts with a yellowish wash on the sides; and plain olive upperparts. Head of birds from eastern Panama to South America is olive, with a whitish eyering."
0,Lesser Ground-Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Morococcyx erythropygus,https://ebird.org/species/legcuc1,"Furtive and rarely seen, but loud song carries well and sounds like a referee’s whistle being blown faster and then slower. Inhabits brushy dry woodland in tropical lowlands, where most of the time it walks stealthily on the ground. When alarmed it usually freezes offering good views—if you are lucky.

0,Lesser Ground-Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Amalocichla incerta,https://ebird.org/species/legrob1,"A fairly small, long-legged bird of montane forest floor. Brown above with rufous edges to the flight feathers, buffy chest, white throat, and white spot behind the bill. Same general shape and habits as the Greater Ground-Robin, but Lesser occurs at lower elevations and is much smaller. Heard more often than seen. Song, a series of whistled notes, either rising, falling or the same pitch."
0,Lesser Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator minor,https://ebird.org/species/leshon1,"A small, inconspicuous, gray-green bird with striking white outer tail feathers that are evident in undulating flight. It is easily confused with other honeyguides, but a pale spot on the top of the bill and subtle, darker (moustachial) streaks on either side of the throat are characteristic. Often it is the commonest honeyguide in mixed woodland, cultivation, and pasture; it can be tracked down by following its continuous, strident “swiiit, swiiit, swiiit” calls. Thick-billed Honeyguide (not recognized by some taxonomies) is almost identical, but it is darker in coloration and prefers closed-canopy forest. The smaller Least Honeyguide is often more heavily streaked underneath, and Pallid Honeyguide has a plainer face and indistinct moustachial streaks; both have differing vocaliations."
0,Lesser Hornero,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Furnarius minor,https://ebird.org/species/leshor1,"The smallest hornero. Plumage rusty overall with a white eyebrow, a gray crown, and a white throat. Note the gray legs. Found in scrub on river islands and occasionally in human-modified habitats near major rivers. Forages walking on the ground, especially at the water’s edge. The song is a series of fast staccato “kee” notes, usually given in duet. Other horneros with overlapping distributions have longer and louder songs."
0,Lesser Jacana,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Jacanidae,Microparra capensis,https://ebird.org/species/lesjac1,"Very small and generally uncommon jacana. Adults show rufous on the crown, breast sides, rump, and tail. Juveniles are duller. Most distinctive in flight, when the white trailing edge to the wing is revealed. Found in thickly vegetated wetlands, especially those with waterlilies. Seems to move around in response to changing water levels. Call is a quick, hooting series. Often confused with immature African Jacana, but smaller and with a shorter bill that never shows any blue. Easily separated in flight by the white stripe at the back of the wing and the pale patches on top of the wing."
0,Lesser Kestrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco naumanni,https://ebird.org/species/leskes1,Shape very similar to Eurasian Kestrel but tail slightly shorter and central tail feathers project slightly. Wings more rounded and shorter than Eurasian Kestrel; claws are white rather than black. Males are unspotted above with blue-gray patches on the upperwings and largely pale underwings. Females have an indistinct mustache but otherwise are rather similar to Eurasian Kestrel. Hovers frequently and catches insects on the wing. Breeds colonially.
0,Lesser Kiskadee,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Pitangus lictor,https://ebird.org/species/leskis1,"This flycatcher is brown above and bright yellow below with a black-and-white head pattern; very similar in plumage to a host of other species including Great Kiskadee and Rusty-margined Flycatcher. However, note Lesser Kiskadee’s smaller size, slender shape, and longer, narrower bill. Sexes alike. Found singly or in pairs, almost exclusively around slow-moving bodies of water in the lowlands of northern South America. Easy to find; tends to perch conspicuously often at eye level close to the water’s surface. Also listen for its slurred buzzy calls to help distinguish from similar species."
0,Lesser Koa-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Rhodacanthis flaviceps,https://ebird.org/species/lekfin,"Extinct, last reported in 1891."
0,Lesser Lophorina,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Lophorina minor,https://ebird.org/species/lesbop1,"A fairly large bird of mid-montane forest. Male, mainly black plumage with 2 remarkable erectile fans which are lifted up over the head during its display. Metallic, blue-green, trapezium-shaped breast shield and patches above the eyes. Female has a dark brown back, barred underparts and a black head. Male is unmistakable. Female distinguished from Lawes’s Parotia female by slightly smaller size and black eye, and from female Magnificent Bird-of-Paradise by its black bill. The male’s yellow-green interior of the mouth is visible whilst it gives its piercing nasal screech."
0,Lesser Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus intermedius,https://ebird.org/species/lesmaw1,"A small, slender weaver with a whitish eye and distinctive slate-colored (not pinkish) legs. The male has a black mask that extends to the peak of the crown in breeding plumage. The female is nondescript but has a distinctive pale eye and white belly. Pairs prefer riverine thicket and wooded savanna, where they breed colonially. In the non-breeding season, they form large flocks that may wander. Most other pale-eyed weavers have pinkish legs and a yellow crown in breeding plumage."
0,Lesser Melampitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Melampittidae,Melampitta lugubris,https://ebird.org/species/lesmel1,"A shy, medium-sized ground bird of montane forest. Velvety black plumage with long legs, a fairly short tail and a bulbous head. Eye color is red in male and brown in female. Hops around looking for food. Somewhat similar to Blue-gray and Smoky Robins, but Lesser Melampitta is larger and black rather than gray. More often heard than seen. Call, a rather unbirdlike “klik!” or “puk-klik!”."
0,Lesser Moorhen,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Paragallinula angulata,https://ebird.org/species/lesmoo1,"Small, reclusive moorhen. Often confused with the much more common and extroverted Common Moorhen. Lesser Moorhen is smaller and has a narrower white streak along the side, a mostly yellow bill, and all-yellow legs. Immature is brownish--warmer brown than immature Common Moorhen--with a yellow bill. Found in wetlands, especially grassy, seasonally flooded ones. Shy and retiring. Calls a series of clucks or drier “chak” notes."
0,Lesser Necklaced Laughingthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Leiothrichidae,Garrulax monileger,https://ebird.org/species/lenlau1,"A mid-sized laughingthrush, usually seen foraging on the ground and in shrubbery of hilly forest. Brown overall, with rusty highlights on the neck and flanks, and with prominent black markings on the white breast and face. Looks similar to the slightly larger Greater Necklaced Laughingthrush, with which it often associates in mixed flocks; Lesser differs in being duller rusty overall, having a complete (rather than partial) breast band, and having minimal streaking on the cheeks. Classic laughingthrush repertoire, with a beautiful fluty, meldic song and hooting calls."
0,Lesser Nighthawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Chordeiles acutipennis,https://ebird.org/species/lesnig,"Long-winged nocturnal bird which catches insects in flight often around dawn and dusk. Found in shrubby open areas. Intricate brown, buffy, and gray patterning with white patches near wingtips. Very similar to Common Nighthawk, best distinguished by the position of white wing patch: closer to wingtip on Lesser, closer to base of wing on Common, but this difference can be very difficult to judge. Also typically paler than Common with more golden buffy tones. During the day, roosts on the ground or on a tree branch."
0,Lesser Noddy,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Anous tenuirostris,https://ebird.org/species/lesnod1,"A small dark tern which appears grayish-black and extremely slender. Very similar to Black and Brown Noddies, but the Lesser Noddy has a very thin bill, is somewhat paler gray overall, and has gray between the bill and the eyes. The flight is fast and graceful, and it often mixes with other terns. Often found offshore, not far from islands in the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean."
0,Lesser Nothura,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Tinamiformes,Tinamidae,Nothura minor,https://ebird.org/species/lesnot1,Sandy-colored tinamou that usually holds an upright posture. Has a brown crown and a heavily streaked back and throat. Occurs in grassland areas with scrub. The song is a series of metallic whistles: “peee peeeeee-peeep peeep peeep peeeeee.” The similar Spotted Nothura is larger and more rufescent and prefers areas with shorter grasses.
0,Lesser Prairie-Chicken,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Tympanuchus pallidicinctus,https://ebird.org/species/lepchi,"Plump chickenlike bird found in grasslands. Body and wings entirely barred brown with paler buffy throat. In spring, males gather at display site and perform dance to attract females: look for them hunched over with ear-like feathers protruding from atop head and darker reddish-orange skin exposed on the neck. Inconspicuous and difficult to find away from display sites. Very similar to Greater Prairie-Chicken but no range overlap. Averages slightly paler and smaller than Greater."
0,Lesser Redpoll,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Acanthis cabaret,https://ebird.org/species/lesred1,"Fairly common in mixed and coniferous woodland and forest, especially with birch trees; also found in parks and gardens, and visits seed feeders. Often in flocks, mainly in autumn–winter; feeds especially on birch catkins, also on seeds on the ground. Rather warm brown and streaky overall with a small yellowish bill and deep red forehead patch (or ""poll"") and small black chin; male has bright pinkish-red blush to throat and breast. Compare with very similar Common Redpoll (identifying redpolls outside their breeding range is not always possible)."
0,Lesser Roadrunner,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Geococcyx velox,https://ebird.org/species/lesroa1,"Slightly smaller version of the familiar cartoon Greater Roadrunner, but usually the two species do not occur in the same places. Favors dry brushy woodland and overgrown weedy fields in tropical lowlands and foothills. Can be very elusive, but at other times runs out in the road or sits quietly sunning itself on a fence post or bush top in the early morning. Note that the center of the throat and breast are plain rich buffy, without the dense dark streaking of Greater Roadrunner."
0,Lesser Sand-Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius mongolus,https://ebird.org/species/lesplo,"Medium-sized plover with a pale throat, brown back, and white belly. Breeding adults have a black mask and a bright orange chest and neck; males average brighter than females. Non-breeding and immature birds are brownish above and white below, with white “eyebrows.” Subspecies vary slightly. Compare with slightly larger Greater Sand-Plover; Lesser is proportionally smaller-headed and darker-legged, and its shorter bill has a slight bulge at the tip. Smaller Kentish Plover can be similar in non-breeding plumage; Lesser is taller and longer-legged, without Kentish’s strong white neck band. Breeds on margins of high-elevation lakes and rivers, winters on coastal mudflats."
0,Lesser Scaup,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aythya affinis,https://ebird.org/species/lessca,"Peak-headed diving duck. Males have black breast, finely-barred gray back, whitish sides (often slightly dusty-looking), and yellow eye. Head appears black with a purplish or greenish sheen in good light. Females are brown overall with white patch at base of bill and yellow eye. Very similar to Greater Scaup; note Lesser’s peaked head shape with angle near the rear of crown, slimmer cheeks, less extensive white stripe on wing in flight, and smaller, narrower bill. Also similar to Ring-necked Duck, but Lesser Scaup has grayer back and whiter sides. Usually in flocks or pairs on a variety of wetland habitats, from small ponds to large lakes and bays. Slightly more likely to be seen on smaller bodies of water, especially fresh water, than Greater Scaup, but much overlap. Frequently in mixed flocks with other Aythya ducks. Widespread across North America, with more southerly range extent than Greater Scaup, regularly reaching northern South America."
0,Lesser Seedcracker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Pyrenestes minor,https://ebird.org/species/lessee1,"A colorful, chunky waxbill with a large conical bill. Both sexes have a red hood and tail, but females have slightly less extensive red. Found in moist habitats with dense understory, including forest edge, areas along streams, and occasionally reedbeds. Scarce, shy, and inconspicuous. Somewhat similar to Red-headed Bluebill, but separated by many details, including the red tail. The calls include rough “drek” notes that may be given in a long, fast series."
0,Lesser Shortwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Brachypteryx leucophris,https://ebird.org/species/lessho1,"A small ground-hugging bird found in areas with dense cover, usually near moving water. Unlike most shortwings, male and female are not significantly different; both sexes are brown or gray overall, with a white eyebrow and throat. Furtive and quite difficult to see; its tinkling melodic song, which starts with 1-2 slow notes and quickly accelerates into a rushed-sounding loud musical jumble, may give away its position in the undergrowth."
0,Lesser Spotted Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Clanga pomarina,https://ebird.org/species/leseag1,"Medium-sized, compact eagle. Adults are conspicuously two toned when perched: dark flight feathers contrast with paler body. Head and bill small for an eagle. Juveniles quite different, with bold white bars on the back, wings, and pale uppertail. Smaller and paler than the similar Greater Spotted Eagle. Look for the diagnostic double (not single) white ""commas"" on the wrist of the underwing. Normally found in open woodland or forest edges but can be found around low intensity farmland areas, sometimes perching prominently."
0,Lesser Spotted Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Dryobates minor,https://ebird.org/species/leswoo1,"Uncommon to locally fairly common in deciduous woodland, parkland, larger gardens. Very small (sparrow-sized) and easily overlooked, often foraging quietly on smaller branches and twigs high in canopy. Note bold white barring on back and wings, whitish underparts with no red blush under tail; male has red crown patch."
0,Lesser Striped Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Cecropis abyssinica,https://ebird.org/species/lessts1,"A rather small, neat swallow with a distinctive burnt-orange skullcap extending onto the cheeks like a helmet, a rufous rump, and boldly streaked underparts. It is mostly resident in equatorial Africa, and a wet season breeding visitor to the northwest and southeast parts of its range. Pairs and small groups forage over grassland, woodland, and cultivation, generally at lower elevations than Greater Striped Swallow. The flight is fairly strong, much like that of a Barn Swallow. The larger Greater Striped Swallow is similar to Lesser Striped Swallow but with fewer and finer streaks, especially on the throat and ears, giving it a more open-faced appearance."
0,Lesser Swamp Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus gracilirostris,https://ebird.org/species/leswar1,"Nondescript, long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Varies geographically, with the back being olive-brown to rusty-brown, and the underparts pure white to pale brown. Found in reedbed wetland habitat, including papyrus. Far less secretive than many marsh-dwelling warblers; often hops about in the open. Frequently sings a variable, complex mix of raspy and musical notes that usually ends in a trill. Smaller than Greater Swamp Warbler, larger than African Reed Warbler, and shorter-winged than Great Reed Warbler."
0,Lesser Vasa Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Coracopsis nigra,https://ebird.org/species/blapar1,"Fairly large, black parrot that is found in and around all types of forest. Often seen in flight, sometimes in small, loose flocks. Incredibly loud calls consist mainly of musical whistles. Can be very hard to separate from Greater Vasa Parrot, but smaller and smaller-billed, with a curving edge to the skin at the back of the bill. Vocalizations are higher-pitched and more musical than those of Greater Vasa Parrot. Can easily be mistaken for a raptor in flight, but has all-black plumage unlike any raptor in range."
0,Lesser Violetear,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Colibri cyanotus,https://ebird.org/species/lesvio1,"Medium-sized hummingbird, all sparkly green with obvious blue or purple cheek patch. Bill is slightly decurved. Sexes similar. Extremely similar to Mexican Violetear, but no range overlap. Sparkling Violetear of South America is larger and has violet belly. Found singly in forests, where it can be quite common. Also visits feeders and gardens. Listen for the constant chipping song."
0,Lesser Whistling-Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Dendrocygna javanica,https://ebird.org/species/lewduc1,"A small, well-proportioned, tree-nesting duck. Pale brown overall with a darker brown crown and nape, warmer chestnut underparts, and chestnut-fringed feathers on the back. Note the faint orange-yellow eyering and the dark gray bill and legs. Sexes similar; juveniles duller. A gregarious duck found in shallow water bodies with abundant vegetation. Flies with rapid wingbeats on broad dark wings; note flashing chestnut shoulders and chestnut rump. Call is a wheezy whistling “seasick-seasick."""
0,Lesser Whitethroat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sylviidae,Curruca curruca,https://ebird.org/species/leswhi4,"Fairly common summer migrant from winter grounds in Africa. Found in scrubby habitats, especially dense hedges with thorny bushes and trees. Skulking and difficult to see well; often located by scratchy chortling song that ends with distinctive loud rattle.

0,Lesser Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Xiphorhynchus fuscus,https://ebird.org/species/leswoo2,"Small, slim woodcreeper with a thin slightly decurved bill. Found in a variety of forest habitats, where it regularly follows mixed-species flocks. The rufous-brown body is heavily marked with drop-shaped spots on the breast, head, and back. The strong pale eyering, eyestripe, and throat add to the overall pale appearance of the head."
0,Lesser Yellowlegs,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Tringa flavipes,https://ebird.org/species/lesyel,"Medium-sized shorebird with bright yellow legs. Plumage is essentially identical to Greater Yellowlegs: gray upperparts with white speckling, streaky neck, and white belly. Proportions are most important for identification. Lesser is smaller overall with shorter, narrower, straighter bill, shorter neck, more rounded head, and smaller chest. Forages actively on mudflats and in shallow pools and marshes, often in loose mixed flocks with Greater Yellowlegs. Somewhat more likely to be found in smaller, marshier habitats than Greater, but much overlap. Listen for soft, whistled “tew” calls, typically only one or two notes, unlike the stronger series of notes from Greater."
0,Lesser Yellownape,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Picus chlorolophus,https://ebird.org/species/lesyel1,"Medium-sized woodpecker with a colorful crest. Coloration varies considerably based on range, but always look for a bright yellow hindcrest, overall greenish coloration, and white-barred chest. Greater Yellownape is significantly larger with an all-gray belly.

Perches low to high, usually in shady areas. Blue crown with a big black central patch, unlike solid blue of Blue-capped Motmot, which occurs to the north. Plumage overall less contrasting in pattern than Turquoise-browed Motmot, with much smaller tail rackets. The name ‘motmot’ comes from double-hooting call of this species, which can sound like an owl, and is mainly uttered around dawn."
0,Lesson's Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sporophila bouvronides,https://ebird.org/species/lessee2,"Small, sparrow-like bird. Male has mostly black head with large white whisker mark; female is olive-brown on back and pale yellowish below with a dull yellow bill. Found in open marshlands and disturbed habitats with long grass, especially near water; often seen in flocks, feeding on grass seeds. Song is a staccato series of about 10 notes on one pitch. Most similar to Lined Seedeater, but male Lesson’s lacks a white stripe on crown; females of the two species are identical and not safely identified unless accompanied by males. Females are best told from other seedeaters (except Lined) by strong yellowish wash on underparts and relatively small, dull yellow bill."
0,Lettered Aracari,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Ramphastidae,Pteroglossus inscriptus,https://ebird.org/species/letara1,"Small toucan found across southern Amazonia. Unlikely to be confused in range. Essentially dark above with entirely yellow underparts; note the bare blue skin above the eye. Named for the squiggly dark markings on the bill.

Cheek patch is often a crescent compared to the circular patch on Graceful Honeyeater and the oval path on Yellow-spotted Honeyeater. Adults have a bluish eye, while the similar Graceful Honeyeater has a blue-gray eye and Yellow-spotted Honeyeater has a brown eye. Listen for the rapid staccato machine-gun call of Lewin’s compared to the loud repeated whistles of the Yellow-spotted Honeyeater and the more simple, single note call of Graceful Honeyeater. Of the three easily confusable species, this is the only one found away from the tropics; it occurs in wetter forests and gardens all along the eastern coast of Australia."
0,Lewin's Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Lewinia pectoralis,https://ebird.org/species/lewrai1,"Cryptic rail with long, decurved bill. Adult has reddish-brown crown and nape, gray breast, and black-and-white barred belly. Darker juvenile very dull in comparison and lacks the reddish-brown crown.

Pairs often forage and perch together, often on exposed bare branches. Like other pigeons, frequently gathers at fruiting trees. Song is a series of strangely buzzy rising whistles."
0,Little Green Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Anthreptes seimundi,https://ebird.org/species/ligsun2,"Tiny, drab warbler-like sunbird. The bill is slightly curved and partially pink. Also note the pale eye-ring. Found in the canopy and mid-story of humid forest at low and middle elevations, usually in pairs or small groups. The most common call is a simple, high-pitched “tseeet”. Very similar to Bates’s Sunbird, but has a less curved bill and a more distinct eye-ring. Distinguished from females of other species of sunbirds by the pink on the bill and the green rather than blackish tail."
0,Little Green Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campethera maculosa,https://ebird.org/species/ligwoo1,"A small woodpecker with a green back, barred underparts, and a finely speckled face without strong markings. The crown is red in males and black in females. Inconspicuous in lowland rainforest, including in edge habitat and clearings. The call is an arresting “ka-reek,” sometimes repeated several times. Very similar to Green-backed Woodpecker, though there is only a small area of range overlap. Distinguished by subtle details, including the all-black rather than olive-and-black tail. Female further distinguished by the all-black rather than red-and-black crown."
0,Little Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Eurillas virens,https://ebird.org/species/litgre2,"This small greenbul is unusually plain, even by the standards of greenbuls. It does show a rusty tinge to the tail. Found in the understory and mid-story of forest, thickets, and overgrown cultivation. Skulking bird that is difficult to see well, but which is often common. Usually detected by distinctive song, which starts with hesitant introductory notes, then finishes with an explosive, bubbling jumble of notes. Very similar to several other greenbul species. Best distinguished by a combination of vocalizations and lack of a pale eye-ring."
0,Little Ground-Tyrant,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Tyrannidae,Syrtidicola fluviatilis,https://ebird.org/species/ligtyr1,"Small tan flycatcher of river beaches; terrestrial, or perches on low shrubs. Tan above, lighter whitish below, with a black tail with white outer tail feathers. Overlaps with the similar and often more common Drab Water Tyrant. Compared to that species, Little Ground-Tyrant has lighter underparts, no facial pattern (unlike the black eye line and pale eyebrow of Drab Water Tyrant) and white outer tail feathers contrasting with black inner tail feathers (as opposed to uniformly brown). They often flush and move in low flight along river banks, exposing their diagnostic tail patterns. Prefers wide, open beaches and mudflats along rivers to steep river banks. Known to wander when not breeding, when it can be found in a variety of open habitats."
0,Little Gull,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Hydrocoloeus minutus,https://ebird.org/species/litgul,"Smallest gull in the world. Compact with short legs, short rounded wings, and small bill. Breeding adults have black head, pale gray back, white wingtips, and blackish underwings. Nonbreeding adults have a black ear patch and smudgy cap. Immatures are similar to nonbreeding adults but with a black “M”-shaped pattern on the upperwing, especially noticeable in flight. When perched, this looks like a thick horizontal stripe across the wing and shoulder. Primarily a Eurasian species, breeding in marshy wetlands and wintering offshore or in coastal waters. Uncommon to rare in North America, where typically found singly among flocks of Bonaparte’s Gulls on lakes, beaches, estuaries, or bays. Note adult Little Gull's smaller size, white wingtips, dark underwings, and more rounded wings compared to Bonaparte's."
0,Little Hermit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Phaethornis longuemareus,https://ebird.org/species/lither2,"Tiny, mostly warm brown hummingbird. Note distinctive curved bill; long, white central tail feathers; and dark brown throat. Found in understory of swampy forest, including second growth and abandoned plantations, primarily in coastal areas. Forages on nectar, visiting widely-spaced food sources and often seen flying between them in low, direct flight, giving a characteristic plaintive squeak. At close range, often detected by loud and erratic wing noise, like a large bee, as it weaves among understory plants. May pause briefly to investigate people. Males sing from low perches; song is a series of high, slurred notes with a distinctive pattern. Most similar to Reddish Hermit, but Little is much less rufous, lacks a black breast band, and is generally restricted to coastal swamp forests."
0,Little Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Ceyx pusillus,https://ebird.org/species/litkin1,"A tiny blue and white kingfisher. Typically occurs beside rivers, lagoons, waterholes, as well as in mangroves at the coast, where it hunts prey from a perch above the water. Gives a high pitched very thin whistle."

0,Little Pied Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula westermanni,https://ebird.org/species/lipfly1,"Male is strikingly unique with his bold black-and-white patterning. Female is unique in her plainness: somber gray-brown above with pale underparts and a slightly cinnamon tint to the rump. Breeds in broadleaf, coniferous, and mixed forests in foothills and montane areas. Himalayan birds descend into lower foothills in the winter. Sallies from exposed perches in the upper and middle levels of the forest and moves with mixed flocks in the non-breeding season. Vocalizations are variable, and include a series of high notes followed by buzzing and tinkling notes (“chi-chi-chi-brr-titititi”), a steadily accelerating series of chiming notes, and a series of clear bell-like phrases followed by a short buzzy sputtering. Calls include high notes and rolling low rattles."
0,Little Raven,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Corvus mellori,https://ebird.org/species/litrav1,"Australian crows and ravens are challenging to identify; concentrate on call, throat-hackles, behavior, and location. Calls usually fairly fast and lack the drawn-out wail typical of Australian Raven. Long throat hackles lend it a slightly bearded appearance. Often flicks wings when calling. Inhabits a broad area of southeastern Australia. The default crow/raven in Adelaide and Melbourne and forms very large flocks in high-elevation areas like the Australian Alps."
0,Little Ringed Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius dubius,https://ebird.org/species/lirplo,"Delicately built small plover with bright yellow eyerings. Note dull pinkish legs and large white forehead patch (in adults). Plumage much like bulkier Ringed Plover, but white eyebrow continues unbroken across forehead. In flight shows narrow, indistinct whitish wing stripe. Breeds on stony substrates around lakes, gravel pits, and along rivers; migrants occur in wide variety of fresh and brackish wetland habitats, but rarely out on open tidal areas. Clipped “peu” call quite distinct from call of similar Common Ringed Plover."

The tail has a black-and-orange “T” pattern that is conspicuous in flight. Males and females vary slightly: males are cleaner blue-gray above, while females are more brownish. Found locally in a variety of habitats with a mix of rocks, trees, and bushes. Sometimes also on and around human structures. Similar to redstarts, but easily distinguished by the clean gray hood and the lack of black on the face. Also similar to male Rufous-tailed Rock-Thrush, but smaller, lacking white on the back, and with a more extensive gray hood. The quiet song consists of musical phrases that can be short or quite long."
0,Little Rush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Bradypterus baboecala,https://ebird.org/species/afbwar1,"A nondescript long-tailed, long-billed warbler of wetlands. Varies geographically: the back can be dark brown or rusty brown, and the underparts can have heavy distinct streaking or a bit of blurry streaking. Found in reedbed wetland habitat, including papyrus. Extremely secretive and skulking. Most often seen when it sits up to sing or gives a short display flight. Song starts with slow, hesitant, low wooden notes that speed up, then ends with a trill made by beating the wings together at incredible speed. The variably streaked breast separates it from reed-warblers and swamp-warblers. Very similar to Highland Rush Warbler, but there is little or no overlap in range, and Little sings a much lower-pitched song."
0,Little Shearwater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Puffinus assimilis,https://ebird.org/species/litshe8,"A small, pale-faced shearwater with the separation line between black and white on the face passing through or above the eye. Mainly sedentary and relatively shy, feeding farther offshore than similar seabirds. Winter breeding birds mainly found around the Kermadec Islands, off southwest Australia, and off the northeastern coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The Fluttering Shearwater can be distinguished by its larger size, smudgy brown underwing, dark face, and tendency to congregate in flocks much closer to shore."
0,Little Slaty Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Ficedula basilanica,https://ebird.org/species/lisfly1,"A small bird of tangled undergrowth in lowland and foothill forest. White below with pale orange legs. Male has dark gray upperparts and a short white stripe behind each eye. Upperparts are dark brown in female with no head stripes.

0,Little Sparrowhawk,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Accipiter minullus,https://ebird.org/species/litspa1,"A tiny, secretive and inconspicuous hawk that flies quickly and nimbly within woodland thickets and forest while hunting small birds, other vertebrates, and insects. It has a very distinctive white rump and two pale spots on the upper tail. Call is a distinctive high-pitched bisyllabic, down-and-upslurred “chy-lip”. Similarly-plumaged African Goshawk is much larger; Red-thighed Sparrowhawk is similar in size but prefers dense rainforest, is more rufous below, and generally lacks barring on the underside."
0,Little Spiderhunter,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Arachnothera longirostra,https://ebird.org/species/litspi1,"Active little bird with a long, slightly decurved bill. Olive back, lemon-yellow underparts, and faint gray-and-white facial pattern. Active in the lower levels of secondary forest, forest edge, plantations, and gardens.

0,Little Spotted Kiwi,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Apterygiformes,Apterygidae,Apteryx owenii,https://ebird.org/species/liskiw1,"New Zealand’s smallest kiwi species. Light grayish brown with white horizontal banding or “spotting” along the length of the body. Restricted to offshore predator-free island sanctuaries and to the mainland Zealandia sanctuary in Wellington. More often heard than seen, including loud sniffling as it forages for invertebrates. Male produces a series of burry, rising high-pitched whistles. Female has a lower ascending burry whistle. Both sexes repeat their call many times, often duetting. Could be confused with Weka by voice and shape; look for the kiwi’s much longer bill and lack of tail, and listen for its multisyllabic call."
0,Little Stint,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Calidris minuta,https://ebird.org/species/litsti,"Tiny shorebird with extensive range across Europe, Africa, and Asia. Very rare vagrant in North America. All ages show dark legs and a straight, fine-tipped bill. Adults in breeding plumage are variably flushed with bright rusty orange on the head, neck sides, and upperparts, usually brightest in mid- to late-summer. Compared with breeding Red-necked Stint, note white throat and more uniformly bright wing coverts and scapulars on Little. Juveniles are typically quite bright and neatly patterned above, often with bold white stripes or ""braces"" down the back, and have very black-centered wing coverts and tertials. Nonbreeding birds rather plain pale gray and extremely difficult to separate from other small “peeps”. Note bill shape and overall structure. Temminck’s has longer tail and more crouched posture; Red-necked has slightly shorter bill and legs and more attenuated wings. Found in fresh and brackish wetland habitats.

0,Little Tern,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Laridae,Sternula albifrons,https://ebird.org/species/litter1,"Tiny, delicate-looking tern. Mainly coastal, but also occurs inland locally. Breeding plumage has black cap with white forehead chevron, black-tipped yellow bill. Readily identified by tiny size, though wintering adults can be confusingly similar in patterning to Common Tern; look out for black stripes extending from the shoulder to the wingtip. Breeds colonially on sandy and stony substrates, at times with other terns, from beaches to riverbanks and lakeshores. Often overlooked unless noisy and mobbing you at a colony. Flies with hurried deep wingbeats; splash dives in water to catch small fish."
0,Little Thornbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Phacellodomus sibilatrix,https://ebird.org/species/littho1,"The smallest thornbird. Plumage dull brown, tinged with cinnamon.

During the breeding season, favors fast-moving streams with lots of rocks to hop on. In the northern parts of its range, often in steep hemlock-lined ravines. Winters primarily in Middle America and the Caribbean, where it’s slightly less picky about habitat, and can be found around slower-moving water. Very similar to Northern Waterthrush, but whiter base color below, brighter pink legs, and broader white eyebrow. Also look for clean white throat (usually streaked on Northern). Best distinguished by song: several piercing clear whistles followed by a complex jumble of notes. Call note very similar to Northern: a loud, metallic chip."
0,Lovely Cotinga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cotingidae,Cotinga amabilis,https://ebird.org/species/lovcot1,"Unobtrusive, rather chunky bird of forest canopy in tropical forest of humid lowlands. Most often seen as a single male perched on exposed high branches, less often at fruiting trees where can be quite low. Male is unmistakable: brilliant electric blue (glowing even at long range) with plum-colored throat and belly patch. Female very different: pale grayish overall with white scalloping above and dusky dappling below. Basically silent."
0,Lovely Fairywren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Malurus amabilis,https://ebird.org/species/lovfai1,"A small bird with a long blue and white tail that is held cocked. Tail is much shorter than that of Variegated Fairywren. Breeding male has a pale blue helmet, brownish wings, and a white belly. Females and nonbreeding males are similar to each other: they are completely white underneath (all the way up to the chin) with blue back, crown, and cheeks. They have white eye rings and white in front of their eyes, giving them a spectacled appearance. This species is typically found on the edges of rainforests, mangroves, and dense vegetation in coastal far northern Queensland, where it is the only ""blue"" fairywren."
0,Lovely Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Aethopyga shelleyi,https://ebird.org/species/lovsun1,"A tiny bird of wooded areas from the lowlands to the mountains of Palawan and neighboring islands. Has a fairly long, curved bill, a whitish belly, and olive wings. Male has a pointed green tail, a bright red back, sides, and head, a purple crown and moustache stripe, and a yellow chest with fine red streaking. Male is unmistakable. The drab female is similar to other female sunbirds, but is the only one with a combination of very small size, pale underparts, and olive wings. Voice is a repeated up-and-down “chip-chap! chip-chap! chip-chap!”"
0,Loveridge's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris loveridgei,https://ebird.org/species/lovsun3,"A medium-sized sunbird. Males are colorful, with green upperparts and hood, a yellow belly, and an orangey-red patch on the chest. Females are drab brownish. Endemic to central Tanzania’s Uluguru Mountains. Found in montane forest, especially clearings and forest edge. Separated from similar sunbirds by range. Female could be mistaken for female Variable Sunbird, but is darker on the throat and breast, making for less contrast with the dark head. The calls include a long, descending whistle and a harsh “chet” that often precedes a very quick jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Lowland Akalat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Sheppardia cyornithopsis,https://ebird.org/species/lowaka1,"A small shy akalat found in the lower levels of tall forests, often in dark shady areas near water. Note the reddish-brown back and wings, the gray face, and the bright red-orange chest contrasting with a white belly. Almost always found in lowland forest, but a few local populations are found higher up in the foothills. Within its range, most likely to be confused with Forest Robin, but note Lowland Akalat’s plain gray face and distinctive vocalizations. Song is a series of clear, melancholy whistles given with slight pauses in between, “wheeer, gowheer,” as well as faster, more resonant and metallic series of whistles."
0,Lowland Peltops,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Artamidae,Peltops blainvillii,https://ebird.org/species/lowpel1,"A medium-sized bird of lowland forest edge and clearings. Distinctive plumage. Mainly black, bright red above and below the base of the tail, and white marks on the cheek and back. Perches in tall trees, sallying for flying insects. Very similar to Mountain Peltops, but Lowland is found at lower elevations and has a smaller white cheek. Voice, a double note rap, “plik-it!” repeated at regular intervals. Also, a distinctive, unbirdlike, vibrating rattle."
0,Lowland Sooty Boubou,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius leucorhynchus,https://ebird.org/species/soobou1,"An entirely dark boubou found in thickets and dense vegetation. Widespread, but can be surprisingly rare and local in many parts of its range. A distinctively nondescript medium-sized skulking forest bird whose most obvious field mark is a lack of field marks, as it is wholly dark all over. The scientific name, which means “white-billed,” refers to young birds, whose bills start out white and darken with age. Similar to other species of sooty boubou, but Lowland Sooty Boubou is found at lower elevations and has a distinctive voice: a series of drawn out, ringing hoots or whistles, given singly or in short groups. Calls are harsh, sometimes mechanical chatters."
0,Luapula Cisticola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Cisticolidae,Cisticola luapula,https://ebird.org/species/wincis5,"Relatively colorful, mid-sized, long-tailed cisticola. Note the brown back with thick black streaks, rufous on the wing and cap, and pale underparts. The base color of the back is gray in breeding plumage and rufous in non-breeding plumage. Found in wetland habitats, especially wet scrub. The song is a few “pleek” calls followed by several lower “chek” notes. Very similar to Chirping Cisticola, and best separated by song. Visually, Luapula Cisticola is slightly smaller, the tail is grayer, and the rufous crown and wing patch are brighter."
0,Lucy's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Leiothlypis luciae,https://ebird.org/species/lucwar,"Tiny, nondescript warbler of mesquite woodlands and shrubbery. Plain gray with a whiter belly, faint white eyering, and rufous rump. Rufous crown patch is usually difficult to see. Active, constantly flitting around in brushy areas. Listen for sweet song similar to Yellow Warbler, but typically including sharper notes at the end. Mainly breeds in the southwest U.S.; departs breeding grounds early in summer and migrates to the Pacific slope of Mexico (rarely as far south as Oaxaca) for the winter. Most similar to Virginia’s Warbler, but Lucy’s totally lacks yellow. Also compare with Verdin, but note bill shape."
0,Ludwig's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Neotis ludwigii,https://ebird.org/species/ludbus1,"A large-to-medium-sized bustard with a dull orangish nape and hind neck, and dark gray-brown fore neck and face. Female and juvenile are smaller than male and paler on the face and throat. Pairs and small groups march purposefully in open shrubland and arid woodland in the Karoo and Kalahari. It is partially nomadic within its range and can gather in groups of up to 70 individuals after good rains. The much larger Kori Bustard has a barred grayish neck. Denham’s Bustard has a pale gray fore neck, rather than the dark gray-brown fore neck of Ludwig’s Bustard."
0,Lake Lufira Masked-Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus ruweti,https://ebird.org/species/lalmaw1,"A red-eyed masked-weaver with a plain olive-yellow back and pink-brown legs. The breeding male has a black face mask extending to the hind-crown and almost enveloping the head, and a strong chestnut breast and flanks (mid-belly is yellowish). Female and juvenile are dull green above with wingbars, and yellowish below. Pairs and colonies are very localized residents of riverside vegetation, preferring trees to reedbeds for breeding, at Lake Tshangalele and Kiubo Falls in the southeastern DRC. The ranges of most similar masked-weavers do not overlap, but breeding male Tanganyika Masked-Weaver has a less extensive black mask; Katanga and Southern Masked-Weavers are much yellower."
0,Lunulated Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Oneillornis lunulatus,https://ebird.org/species/lunant2,"Scarce antbird of lowland rainforest understory in eastern Ecuador and northeastern Peru. Both sexes have white throat and eyebrow. Male is otherwise all gray, and female is brown with tan scaling on upperparts and buff spots in the tail. Male is similar to White-throated Antbird, but lacks white barring in tail; also note range and voice. Typically found alone or in pairs, often around swarms of marauding army ants.

Small for a hornbill. Bill fairly short with black bands. Has black wings and rump, a black tail with a pale band, and bare skin with a blue tinge around the eye and chin. Male has pale underparts and head with a black cheek, while female is entirely black. The only other hornbill in range is Rufous Hornbill, but Luzon lacks the red bill. Voice is a sharp, medium-pitched nasal honk, reminiscent of a squeaky toy."
0,Luzon Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus longicornis,https://ebird.org/species/lusowl1,"A fairly small owl of lower-elevation montane forest on Luzon. Dark brown on the head, chest, and upperparts, with barred flight feathers. Eyebrows, beard, and belly whitish, with some patterning. Overlaps geographically with Philippine Scops-Owl, but Luzon is smaller, usually found at higher elevation, and has yellow rather than orange-brown eyes. Voice includes a single slightly rising then falling whistled note, repeated at intervals."
0,Luzon Striped-Babbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Zosteropidae,Zosterornis striatus,https://ebird.org/species/lusbab1,"A fairly small bird of lowland and foothill forest and overgrown disturbed areas on Luzon. Rufous-brown on the wings, back, and tail, with a gray head, heavily-streaked pale underparts, and a black face and moustache stripe. Often found in mixed-species flocks. Somewhat similar to Stripe-sided and Long-billed Rhabdornises, but smaller, with a white eye-ring rather than a black band through the eye. Voice includes a loud rattling trill and various quiet chips and squeals."
0,Lühder's Bushshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Laniarius luehderi,https://ebird.org/species/luebus1,"Distinctive and attractive mid-sized bushshrike. Adults have black upperparts with a white slash across the wing. The top of the head and the breast are orange, and the belly white. Found in forest openings, thick woodland, dense scrub, and overgrown cultivation, where it skulks in thick tangles. The vocalizations include a quick vibrating trill, frog-like notes, ratchets, and low scratchy notes."
0,MacGillivray's Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Geothlypis tolmiei,https://ebird.org/species/macwar,"Chunky, skulking warbler that favors dense undergrowth. Yellow below and olive above with blue-gray head and chest. Blacker lores set off distinctive white arcs above and below eye. Adult males show darkest head; females and immatures have paler gray head and whitish throat. Found in thickets, clearcuts, open mixed forests, and riparian zones. Breeds primarily in mountainous regions of western North America; winters from Mexico to Costa Rica. Compare with Mourning Warbler, but little range overlap, and note longer tail and white eye-arcs on MacGillivray’s."
0,MacGregor's Bowerbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ptilonorhynchidae,Amblyornis macgregoriae,https://ebird.org/species/macbow2,"The common and widespread bowerbird of montane forests. Fairly large, stocky brown like other closely-related species, but the male has a long, flowing, orange crest from the back of its head. The male builds a “Maypole” bower of sticks from a central pole and has a circular mossy arena at the base. Similar to the Streaked Bowerbird, but MacGregor's Bowerbird is found higher up and is larger and unstreaked. Call, a loud rasping. Various whistles and other sounds made at the bower, including mimicry."
0,Macgregor's Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Macgregoria pulchra,https://ebird.org/species/machon3,"A huge distinctive honeyeater of high montane forests and shrubbery. Plump shape and almost entirely black with large orange wattles on the head and orange wing feathers which are very obvious in flight. A territorial and fruit-eating species that is very obvious and easy to see. Smoky Honeyeaters have a similar color scheme but are much smaller. Call is a quiet, fairly high-pitch “cheeep!” note that sounds like it should come from a smaller bird. Also, a series of quicker “chip” notes."
0,Macqueen's Bustard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Otidiformes,Otididae,Chlamydotis macqueenii,https://ebird.org/species/macbus1,"A medium-to-large bustard; significantly smaller than Great Bustard, but larger than Little Bustard. Overall tones are rather pale sandy. The neck is white with a vertical black stripe, most prominent in adult males. Females are slightly smaller and slimmer than males. Very similar to African Houbara Bustard, separated mainly by range. Display of male is an amusing dance in long straight lines across open hills with white ornamental feathers covering its tilting head. Breeds in dry steppe and semi-desert with scattered shrubs. Eastern populations migratory. Normally mute."
0,Macaroni Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Eudyptes chrysolophus,https://ebird.org/species/macpen1,"Medium-sized bulky penguin with a bulbous red bill and a dash of stiff orange “hair.” Disappointingly, named for the resemblance of its spiffy, “fashionable” crest to the hairstyle of fashionable youth, or “macaronis”, and not for the pasta-sauce-orange color of the crest itself. Similar to Southern Rockhopper Penguin, but note Macaroni’s larger size, much more heavy build, chunkier bill, and a droopier, more orange, crest. Breeds in noisy colonies on rocky islands, across a wide area of the Subantarctic and the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula."
0,Maccoa Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Oxyura maccoa,https://ebird.org/species/macduc1,"Medium-sized, chunky, oddly shaped, big-billed duck. Long tail is sometimes cocked up to produce a distinctive silhouette. Breeding male has a black head, rufous body, and blue bill. Female and non-breeding male are dark brown with white head stripes. Prefers freshwater wetlands such as lakes, ponds, and lagoons, though sometimes found on saline lakes. Floats low on the water. Rarely seen in flight; prefers to dive to flee disturbance. Odd shape is unlike any other duck in its range. Colorful breeding male is distinctive."
0,Mackinnon's Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius mackinnoni,https://ebird.org/species/macshr1,"Medium-sized, slim shrike patterned in dark gray, black, and white. The male has completely white underparts, while the female has a rufous flank patch. There are large white slashes across the shoulders. Found along forest edge and in forest clearings, lush woodland, cultivations, and gardens. Usually seen singly or in pairs. The song is a slow, highly varied series of many different types of notes, and can include imitations of other birds. Similar to Northern Fiscal, but has a gray crown and back. Distinguished from other black-masked, gray-backed shrikes by the lack of a white nick on the wing."
0,Macleay's Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Xanthotis macleayanus,https://ebird.org/species/machon2,"Distinctive medium-sized rainforest honeyeater. Underparts are olive with white streaking. Upperparts brown with small white spots on back of neck and larger white spots on back. Black cap on top of head, gray throat.

Note the bright blue eye-ring and large yellow warty patch of skin in front of the eyes. Breeding adult has a wispy crest. Marine, nesting coastally. No other similar birds occur within its limited range. Calls include growls, barks, and hisses."
0,Madagascar Buzzard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Buteo brachypterus,https://ebird.org/species/madbuz1,"Typical brown buzzard that is endemic to Madagascar. Found throughout the island in many different habitats, though absent from pure grassland. Voice is a series of increasingly strident wails, often given in flight. Distinguished in flight from Madagascar Cuckoo-Hawk by larger size, less paddle-shaped wings, and the pale panels toward the tips of the wings. When perched, look for a paler chest and heavily marked belly, whereas Madagascar Cuckoo-Hawk shows the opposite. Separated from immature Madagascar Harrier-Hawk by dark head and lack of pale fringes on the wing."
0,Madanga,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Madanga ruficollis,https://ebird.org/species/rtweye1,"A little-known, highly unusual songbird confined to the island of Buru. Taxonomically confusing; formerly considered a white-eye, but now thought to be an abnormal, arboreal pipit. A plain-looking bird with dull olive upperside and gray upperparts, but with a diagnostic, conspicuous rust-colored throat. Inhabits stunted montane forest, where it behaves like a nuthatch, climbing up and down tree trunks, and often accompanies mixed-species flocks singly or in pairs. Only known vocalization is short, high-pitched, downslurred “zit” note."
0,Madarasz's Tiger-Parrot,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Psittacella madaraszi,https://ebird.org/species/matpar1,"A small, compact parrot of lower and mid-montane forest and clearings. Green body, red vent, and a barred rump. Only males have a brown head. Similar to Modest Tiger-Parrot, but where they co-occur, Madarasz's Tiger-Parrot is usually at lower elevations. Males are very similar but Madarasz’s has larger diffuse, mustard spots on the back of the head. Female Madarasz's has a green head and strong barring on the back of the head. Call, a quiet, modulated high-low-middle whistle “wit-wu-wii”."
0,Madeira Firecrest,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Regulidae,Regulus madeirensis,https://ebird.org/species/firecr3,"Fairly common to uncommon in mixed woodland, forest, plantations, gardens, usually with conifers. In autumn–winter, often travels with foraging flocks of tits and other small woodland birds. Inconspicuous but active, often high in the canopy.

0,Magdalena Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Sipia palliata,https://ebird.org/species/dumant3,"Medium-sized, short-tailed antbird with a bright red eye. Has slate gray head and breast, black throat, brown belly and upperparts, and whitish dotted wings. Female is similar but has a white barred throat and buffy dots in the wings. No overlap with the similar Dull-mantled or Esmeraldas Antbirds. Often found in pairs, typically in rocky shaded ravines along streams in foothills. Often quite vocal; song a strong, relatively high-pitched series of notes “fee-feet-feet-FEET-feteu-feek!”, and call is a harsh “FEeuh.”"
0,Magdalena Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus rodriguezi,https://ebird.org/species/upmtap1,"This tapaculo is a Colombian endemic with two widely separated populations in the eastern Andes. Adult is gray with rusty barring on lower underparts and rump. Young birds are washed and scaled with brown. Very similar to Spillmann’s Tapaculo and Long-tailed Tapaculo, and ID should be based on voice. Song is a seemingly endless series of soft chirps that can continue for a minute or more. Inhabits cloud forest understory and usually quite hard to see well."
0,Magellanic Diving-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pelecanoides magellani,https://ebird.org/species/madpet1,"Very small diving seabird. Fairly common locally in fjords, channels, and the Strait of Magellan, where it can be seen from shore and ferries; uncommon out in open ocean. Swims low in the water and usually dives when approached or runs along the water to fly away from boats. Flight is low and fast over the sea with rapid “whirring” wingbeats; does not glide. Plumage blackish above, whitish below with contrasting white neck sides and a black cap, unlike other diving-petrels."
0,Magellanic Oystercatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Haematopodidae,Haematopus leucopodus,https://ebird.org/species/magoys1,"A boldly patterned large and chunky shorebird of southern South America and Falklands. Favors rocky coastlines and adjacent river mouths, but also frequent on nearby grasslands and lakeshores. Associates readily with other oystercatchers. Told from American Oystercatcher by its glossy black head and upperparts that lack the white shoulder spur. In flight the distinctive upperwing pattern with big white panel on trailing edge separates it from American. At close range, also note the yellow eyering (red on American). Voice is also very distinct from other oystercatchers."
0,Magellanic Penguin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Sphenisciformes,Spheniscidae,Spheniscus magellanicus,https://ebird.org/species/magpen1,"Fairly common to locally common; often seen in inshore waters and from ferries. Breeds around coasts of southern Chile, Argentina, and in the Falklands; nests in colonies in underground burrows. Only identification concern is limited range overlap in central Chile with Humboldt Penguin, which has single (not double) black breast band, narrower white eyebrow, and big pink patch at base of bill. Immatures of the two species very similar and not always safely identified in the field, but Humboldt often shows big pink patch at base of bill."
0,Magellanic Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Pluvianellidae,Pluvianellus socialis,https://ebird.org/species/magplo1,"Uncommon and local in Patagonia, where it favors stony lakeshores; also adjacent coastlines, mainly in winter. Easily overlooked; its mostly gray plumage helps it blend in. Usually in pairs or small groups, feeding mainly along shorelines or wading in shallows; sometimes associates loosely with migrant White-rumped and Baird’s Sandpipers. Stocky shape, plain dove-gray upperparts, and bright pinkish legs are a distinctive combination. In flight shows a white wing stripe, like many other shorebirds. Placed in its own family; more closely related to sheathbills than to plovers."
0,Magellanic Snipe,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Scolopacidae,Gallinago magellanica,https://ebird.org/species/soasni3,"Cryptic shorebird found predominately in lowland wet grasslands and flooded fields. Note the long straight bill, white belly with variegated cryptic plumage, and prominent contrasting pale lines on the face and back. In flight, shows a white terminal tail band. Sings a repetitive “kek kek kek kek” when on the ground. Also listen for harsh and vibrating “drumming” notes given in stuttered couplets, produced with its tail feathers during flight displays. Occurs from central Chile to southern Argentina, extensively across the Patagonia region, including the Falkland Islands. Formerly known as South American Snipe."
0,Magellanic Tapaculo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhinocryptidae,Scytalopus magellanicus,https://ebird.org/species/magtap1,"Often heard but rarely seen; a retiring little gray bird of bamboo thickets and other dense shrubbery at forest edges and along streams, mainly in humid areas. Occurs locally in boulders and low scrub, mainly in the Andes. Can move very quickly through bamboo like a mouse. Plumage is slaty gray overall, often with some paler or brownish barring; some birds have a silvery-white cap or a few white head spots. Best told from Dusky Tapaculo, which has a limited range overlap by voice. Also compare with Ochre-flanked Tapaculo."
0,Magellanic Woodpecker,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Picidae,Campephilus magellanicus,https://ebird.org/species/magwoo1,"Very large black woodpecker of native forests with large diameter trees, from dense, bamboo-choked temperate rainforest to rather open and stunted woodlands in drier areas. Ranges widely in large territories, often in pairs or family groups. Can be very confiding, feeding quietly at close range, when best located by strong taps as it digs out grubs from rotting wood. Male has a flame-red head while the female’s head is black with a distinctive recurved crest. Drumming is a loud, resonant, rapid double-rap that carries well."
0,Magenta Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Procellariidae,Pterodroma magentae,https://ebird.org/species/magpet1,"One of the rarest seabirds in the world, endemic to the Chatham Islands. Medium-sized bird with a distinctive dark gray head, neck, and upper breast and a gray chin. The rest of the underside is white with a light gray underwing. During breeding, the birds mainly forage south and east of their colonies, venturing across the Pacific Ocean to South American and tropical seas in the winter. Many petrel species can appear similar to the Magenta Petrel but can be ruled out if they appear partially hooded, show traces of an “M” across their back, or are found outside of the Chatham Island range during breeding season."
0,Maghreb Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Galerida macrorhyncha,https://ebird.org/species/crelar3,"The North African counterpart of the very similar and closely-related Crested Lark. Slightly paler overall with paler breast streaking and a longer bill than Crested Lark.

0,Maghreb Magpie,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Corvidae,Pica mauritanica,https://ebird.org/species/eurmag3,"The magpie of North Africa; very similar to Eurasian Magpie and closely related. Slightly shorter-winged and longer-tailed than Eurasian Magpie with blue bare skin around the eye. Also lacks gloss on the tail. Found in various wooded habitats including urban and suburban gardens, woodlands, cultivated areas, and forests. Call is a rapid chatter and is slightly higher-pitched than that of Eurasian Magpie."
0,Maghreb Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Strix mauritanica,https://ebird.org/species/tawowl3,"A medium-sized owl with deep black eyes, strictly nocturnal and infrequently seen. Gray to gray-brown overall with a big rounded head. Found at a broad range of elevations from sea level to high mountains, in woodland, forest, parkland, rocky areas, and sometimes towns and villages. Tends to roost well hidden in foliage during the day, when may be detected by tracking down the excited sound of small birds mobbing the owl. Comes out at night to hunt in clearings and more open areas. Most often detected by its quavering hoots and ""kee-wik!"" shrieks, given at night. Somewhat similar to Pharaoh Eagle-Owl, but smaller and grayer, with dark rather than yellow-orange eyes."
0,Magnificent Frigatebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Suliformes,Fregatidae,Fregata magnificens,https://ebird.org/species/magfri,"Massive seabird of warm tropical oceans and coastlines. Overall black with extremely long, deeply forked tail and angular wings. Male completely black with inflatable red pouch on throat (not seen away from breeding colonies) and bluish eyering. In good light, black coloration can show purplish sheen. Adult female has white chest and golden bar on shoulder. Young birds have white head and breast. Often soars for long periods and flies with slow wingbeats. Steals food from other seabirds. Surprisingly acrobatic during aerial chases despite its large size. Limited range overlap with Great Frigatebird (mainly offshore western Mexico and in the Galapagos); identification is complicated by age and sex variation. Adult males are extremely similar; females and immatures best identified by exact pattern of white on head and breast, bill color, and eyering color."
0,Magnificent Riflebird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Paradisaeidae,Ptiloris magnificus,https://ebird.org/species/magrif3,"Large songbird with a very long curved bill, found in rainforest on Cape York and in New Guinea. Males mostly black, with bright metallic blue metallic chest and crown and shaggy black flank plumes. Females brown above, pale with fine barred pattern below, strong white eyebrow, and brown moustachial mark.

0,Magnolia Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Parulidae,Setophaga magnolia,https://ebird.org/species/magwar,"Breeding males are striking and unmistakable: especially look for white wing patch, head pattern, and thick black streaks on underparts. Females and immatures are less obvious and might be mistaken for Canada Warbler, but combination of gray head, yellow underparts, white wingbars, and at least some dark streaks on the flanks is distinctive. Always look for tail pattern from below: basal half is white, tip is black. Breeds in coniferous forests, especially with dense understory. Migrants and wintering birds can be found in any wooded area or edge. Winters primarily in Central America and the Caribbean."
0,Magpie Goose,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anseranatidae,Anseranas semipalmata,https://ebird.org/species/maggoo1,"Large black-and-white waterbird with bulbous lump on the top of its head and striking orange legs and feet.

Quite scarce across most of its range. Call is a descending “teeiw”. Superficially similar to Bronze Mannikin but larger and bigger-billed, with an all-black head and distinctive scallops along the breast sides."
0,Magpie Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius melanoleucus,https://ebird.org/species/magshr1,"A bulky black shrike with scattered white patches on the shoulders and wings and a very long, floppy tail. The sexes have differently colored flanks: females white, males black. Small groups of 3 to 10 sit upright on perches 1 to 5 meters high in grassy open savanna and sparse broadleaf woodland. Perch-and-wait predators, they drop onto insect and small vertebrate prey, and often move locally into recently burned areas to forage. The species gives a shrill starling- or parrot-like “pleeee-eouuu,” often produced by more than one bird at once, and also gives harsh grating cries."
0,Magpie Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Speculipastor bicolor,https://ebird.org/species/magsta1,"An unusual and distinctive starling of dry country. Males are dark above and white below, with a blue-black hood and upperparts; females are dark gray. Both sexes have an orange eye and white patches in the wings that are conspicuous in flight. Found in dry thorn savanna, thorn scrub, and woodland, usually in flocks which wander erratically. The song is a continuous jumble of scratchy notes and whistles. The most common call is a harsh “chek.”"
0,Magpie Tanager,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Cissopis leverianus,https://ebird.org/species/magtan2,"Huge unmistakable pied tanager with a very long tail and a white rump and belly.

0,Malabar Barbet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Megalaimidae,Psilopogon malabaricus,https://ebird.org/species/crfbar1,"A chunky green barbet with diagnostic red over its entire face, forehead, throat, and breast. It has a diffuse blue band on the sides of the head and breast, while a thick black traverse band separates the blue parts from the red. Some faint streaking visible below on an otherwise green ground color. Juvenile is duller green, lacks the prominent face pattern of the adult, sports a gray band instead of blue, and shows some yellow among the red feathers. Juvenile is best told from a juvenile Coppersmith Barbet by its unstreaked underparts. Malabar Barbet is heard more often than seen. Its call is a fast paced “kuk-kuk-kuk,” doubtfully separable from that of a Coppersmith by its sometimes slightly faster pace. Malabar sticks to the wetter jungles of the Western Ghats and does not occupy the drier or more open habitats of the Coppersmith, though in some localities both species co-occur."
0,Malabar Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Galerida malabarica,https://ebird.org/species/mallar1,"A rusty-brown bird with very heavily streaked upperparts.

0,Malabar Whistling-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myophonus horsfieldii,https://ebird.org/species/mawthr1,"Deep blue ground-dweller with shining forehead and shoulder patches; belly can appear mottled blue-and-black in the right lighting. Inhabits foothills and montane forests, where it sticks closely to water, especially rocky streams and smaller rivers with overhanging vegetation and rocky ledges. Song is an eerie and human-like series of variable, deliberate-sounding whistles. Call is a high thin “tseeeeee.”"
0,Malabar Woodshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vangidae,Tephrodornis sylvicola,https://ebird.org/species/malwoo1,"Large, dark woodshrike with ashy gray upperparts and darker gray wing panel and tail with a variable brownish tinge.

Found in almost all habitats with water, including streams, rivers, lakes, rice paddies, and lagoons. Sits motionless for long periods before plunging to the water to snatch prey. Call is a harsh “tshik,” often given in flight. Similar to African Pygmy-Kingfisher, but larger, has less orange on the face, and prefers aquatic habitats."
0,Malachite Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Nectarinia famosa,https://ebird.org/species/malsun1,"Breeding male is unmistakable: bright green with a long tail. Non-breeding male is duller but usually still shows some iridescent green and an elongated tail. Female is a big, dull sunbird with a long bill. Found in fynbos, moorland, grassland, scrub, and exotic tree plantations. Restricted to high elevations except in South Africa, where it occurs down to sea level. Song consists of “tyep” notes and emphatic rattles. Female similar to female Bronze Sunbird but larger, duller below, and with a fainter eyebrow."

The head is pure black in breeding plumage and streaked white in non-breeding plumage. Found in a wide variety of habitats, including forest, scrub, plantations, savannah, and marsh. Generally skulks in thick vegetation, anywhere from the ground to high in the canopy, though will sometimes sing from an exposed perch. “Water bottle” song is a beautiful descending series of “boop” notes. Call is a long, dry rattle. Size, shape, and dark coloration make it distinctive within its range."
0,Malagasy Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus macrosceles,https://ebird.org/species/reuhar3,"A typical harrier, with long slender wings and tail and graceful swooping flight. Male has pale gray panels in the wings, while female is browner and more uniform. Found mainly in open habitats, including marsh and montane grassland. Occasionally seen flying over forest. Spends long periods on the wing and is rarely seen perched. Most often confused with Black Kite, but has longer wings, a longer, narrower, and un-forked tail, a white rump, and pale underparts. Coloration overall similar to other raptors like Madagascar Buzzard, but lanky harrier shape is distinctive."
0,Malagasy Kestrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Falconiformes,Falconidae,Falco newtoni,https://ebird.org/species/madkes1,"Typical kestrel with a rufous back, barred tail, and dark “moustache” mark on the face.

Found in almost all habitats with water, including streams, rivers, lakes, rice paddies, and along the coast. Sits motionless for long periods before plunging to the water to snatch prey. Call is a harsh “tshik,” often given in flight. Separated from Madagascar Pygmy-Kingfisher by blue upperparts and mostly dark bill. Prefers wetlands, whereas Pygmy-Kingfisher is found in forest."
0,Malagasy Palm-Swift,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Cypsiurus gracilis,https://ebird.org/species/malpas1,"A very slender gray-brown swift with a long, deeply forked tail that is often held closed, making it look needle-like and pointed. The erratic flight pattern, with frequent direction changes and rapid wingbeats on long, scythe-shaped wings, is distinctive. Less gregarious than other swifts; usually found in pairs or small flocks, and association with other swallows and swifts is usually only fleeting. Forages over a wide variety of habitats with palms, including savanna, coastal scrub, towns, villages, cultivated areas, forest edge, and clearings, from sea level up to 1100 meters of elevation, preferring lowlands. Nests and roosts in palms, especially Hyphaene, Bismarckia, and coconut palms. Gives a high-pitched, metallic “tre-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit-tit” call, solitarily or in unison with others. Separated from other swifts by its longer and thinner tail. Further separated from the larger Madagascar Swift by its much weaker and more fluttering flight."

Female is rufous and lacks tail streamers. Both sexes have a blue ring around the eye. Found in all forest types and in adjacent plantations and scrub. Restless, active mid-story bird that sometimes joins mixed feeding flocks. Call is a tearing “shree-shreeet”, and song a long, musical series of “twee” notes. Black-and-white males larger and longer-tailed than Ward’s Flycatcher, without a black chest band. Rufous coloration, blue eye ring, and upright posture identify female."
0,Malagasy Pond-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Ardeola idae,https://ebird.org/species/mapher1,"Chunky, short-legged heron. All white with a black-tipped blue bill and bright red legs in breeding plumage. Dark brown with white wings and belly in non-breeding plumage. Found in a variety of freshwater wetlands, though generally rare. Distinctive in breeding plumage, but easily confused with Squacco Heron in non-breeding plumage, when Madagascar Pond-Heron can be carefully distinguished by the much darker brown color on most of the body, which contrasts sharply with the white belly and wing."
0,Malagasy Sacred Ibis,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Threskiornithidae,Threskiornis bernieri,https://ebird.org/species/sacibi3,"Large white ibis with fluffy black feathers across the rump and a black head. A good view reveals a pale eye in adults. Immatures can have a dark eye and white on the throat. In flight, the wings are completely white. Rare and local resident of western Madagascar and Aldabra, in the Seychelles. Found on coastal mudflats and sandy shores, in mangroves, and on the banks of brackish rivers, ponds, and lakes.

0,Malayan Night-Heron,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Pelecaniformes,Ardeidae,Gorsachius melanolophus,https://ebird.org/species/manher1,"Bizarre-looking bird with the squat, staring appearance of a toad. Adult is dark cinnamon-brown with a black crown and a black stripe running from the throat down to the breast. Juvenile is very different, with gray-brown barring all over the body (darkest on the crown). Breeding birds have an especially bright blue facial skin patch between the bill and the eyes; the patch is faded in non-breeders, and yellowish in juveniles. Japanese Night-Heron is similar but averages duller brown with less contrasting black patches. Typically nocturnal and furtive in forested areas, but can frequently be tame and active during the day as well."
0,Malayan Whistling-Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Myophonus robinsoni,https://ebird.org/species/mawthr2,"Dark bluish thrush-like bird with a bright yellow bill. Found solely in the highlands of peninsular Malaysia. Lacks “spangled” look of Blue Whistling-Thrush. Found in hilly or montane forests, where it favors wet stony areas around streams or gullies. Call is a high sharp whistle, somewhat akin to brakes squealing."
0,Malaysian Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis turcosus,https://ebird.org/species/mabfly1,"Small flycatcher with brilliant blue upperparts, a pale orange throat and chest, and a white belly. Slightly paler female has a whitish throat, while male’s is blue; sexes are otherwise quite similar. Head is fairly uniformly blue, without boldly lighter or darker patches, unlike in many other “blue flycatchers”. Pale and restricted orange also serves as a helpful identifying feature. A lowland species, restricted to secluded riverine forests in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, but found in a variety of dry and wet forests on Borneo. Song is a short smooth series of drawn-out piping whistles."
0,Malaysian Eared-Nightjar,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Caprimulgidae,Lyncornis temminckii,https://ebird.org/species/malnig1,"Medium-sized nightjar with a long-necked and short-headed profile; namesake “ears'' are often difficult to see. Note dark face, thin off-white collar, and white slashes on the throat (most visible in flight). Unlike many other nightjars, often perches quite erect on branches. Very similar to Great Eared-Nightjar, with which it overlaps incrementally in northern Malaysia; in good lighting, note Malaysian’s less contrasting crown and overall darker coloration. Gives a ringing “wit-peew-ow!” in flight. Flies over a range of habitats, from lowland rainforests to open scrub forest and farmland."
0,Malaysian Honeyguide,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Piciformes,Indicatoridae,Indicator archipelagicus,https://ebird.org/species/malhon1,"Uncommon and unobtrusive in lowland and foothill forests. Unremarkable yet distinctive in its appearance: olive brown above and pale below with a bicolored bill, somewhat resembling a large-bodied, small-headed sparrow in structure if not in size. Male has yellow edges on the wings and a blood-red eye; female lacks these yellow areas and has a duller brownish eye. Gives a nasal “nyeh!” as well as an odd, low grating trill. Forages at beehives, consuming beeswax like its more well-known relatives."
0,Malaysian Pied-Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura javanica,https://ebird.org/species/piefan1,"A bold and adaptable songbird of wooded areas, ranging from open forests to parks and gardens. Dark above and white below; note slender white eyebrows, black chest band, and white-tipped black tail. Combination of all-white belly and plain back separates this species from similar dark fantails within its range. Very active, often bobbing and fanning its tail. Frequently joins mixed-species flocks. Song is a very high-pitched, squeaky “chee-wee-chee-wee-chee-wee-chit”, with a short, falling last note. Calls include harsh churring and high-pitched squeaky chattering."
0,Malaysian Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius peronii,https://ebird.org/species/malplo1,"Small pale plover, typically found on sandy beaches. Occasionally visits estuaries, seawalls, and mudflats as well. Very similar in all plumages to Kentish Plover, with which it occasionally mixes. Male is sandy brown with a black collar, pale face, and a rufous-and-black crown. Thinner collar and eye-line than Kentish Plover. Female and juvenile are similarly brown with a white collar and face. All plumages have diagnostically pale-fringed feathers which give the bird a worn, faded-out appearance; molting Kentish Plover may appear worn but not in such a uniform manner."
0,Maleo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Macrocephalon maleo,https://ebird.org/species/maleo1,"A massive black-and-white megapode with a rose-pink breast and a diagnostic prominent knob on the nape. Found in lowland and hill forest, in areas near beaches or areas with volcanic sands in which they lay their eggs. Immatures show a blacker head with a white throat and a tufted crest. Occurs in pairs that forage on the ground and roost in trees by night. Often best seen at known egg-laying sites, either during laying sessions, or roosting in trees nearby. Generally silent, but occasionally gives a loud, bubbling “waow.”"
0,Malherbe's Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittaculidae,Cyanoramphus malherbi,https://ebird.org/species/malpar2,"A small, green, long-tailed parakeet endemic to New Zealand. Note the distinct lemon-yellow crown and the thin orange band extending from the base of the beak to each red eye. Juveniles are a duller color and their orange band and crown may be absent. A critically endangered bird now restricted to three beech forest valleys in inland Canterbury and several offshore island sanctuaries. Usually very quiet and challenging to see. Listen for its loud, brief chatter call to give away its location. When pairs are together, softer contact calls can be heard. Forms small flocks in autumn and winter. Smaller size and lack of crimson frontal band and rump patches distinguish Malherbe’s from Yellow-crowned Parakeet. Juvenile Yellow-crowned Parakeet can confuse identification, and calls of the two species can be challenging to differentiate."
0,Mali Firefinch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Estrildidae,Lagonosticta virata,https://ebird.org/species/malfir1,"A small brown and reddish waxbill with a blue-gray bill and black under the tail. There are usually a few white spots along the shoulder, but these are sometimes lacking. Found locally in dry, rocky habitat with grass and bushes. Usually in pairs or small groups. Extremely similar to African Firefinch, but duller overall, with more red on the forehead and fewer white spots on the shoulders. Also similar to Red-billed and Bar-breasted Firefinches, but shows black under the tail. Calls include a short dry trill, a high “veet” note, and a long, lower “feeeu” note. Quiet song is a mix of low trills and higher-pitched whines and whistles."
0,Malia,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Locustellidae,Malia grata,https://ebird.org/species/malia1,"An oriole-sized, bulbul-like songbird confined to Sulawesi. Plain olive-green above and yellow below. Central and southeast Sulawesi form shows rufous wings and tail; elsewhere these are olive. Noisy pairs or small groups are leaders of mixed-species flocks within canopy and subcanopy of montane forest, often gleaning food from thick, mossy trunks. Large size, bulbul-like appearance, and behavior make it unmistakable. Raucous, jarring calls include loud chattering and explosive warbles. These are conspicuous and far-carrying."
0,Malindi Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus melindae,https://ebird.org/species/malpip1,"A large pipit with a long, strong bill and legs and a long tail. Shows heavy streaking on the underparts, brown upperparts, and a strong pale eyebrow. The base of the bill and the legs are bright pinkish-yellow. Found in coastal grasslands, especially seasonally flooded ones, and cultivated areas. Can be separated from other pipits by a combination of range, habitat, large size, sturdy structure, dark plumage overall, and very heavy streaking below. The song is a slowly repeated “churee” note, and the common call is a rising “sveet.”"
0,Mallard,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Anas platyrhynchos,https://ebird.org/species/mallar3,"A large duck, generally common and familiar within its extensive range. Males are distinctive with iridescent green head, yellow bill, chestnut breast, and gray body. Females are mottled brown with orange and black splotches on the bill. Found anywhere with water, including city parks, backyard creeks, and various wetland habitats. Often in flocks, and frequently mixes with other duck species. In North America, females can be tricky to distinguish from American Black Duck, Mottled Duck, and Mexican Duck where ranges overlap. Those species are all darker-bodied than Mallard. A good view of the wing can be helpful, too: white wingbars on the leading and trailing edges of the blue wing patch are bolder on Mallard. Frequently hybridizes with those species, which can be even more confusing. Any bird with extensive white in the tail or curled feathers above the tail has some Mallard genes."
0,Mallee Emuwren,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Maluridae,Stipiturus mallee,https://ebird.org/species/malemu1,"Tiny buff-brown bird with enormously long, fine tail, found in areas of mallee woodland with large spinifex clumps in a small area of far western Victoria. Crown a clean, rich brown, with streaked back, wings, and cheek; underparts buffy brown. Males have a sky-blue throat. Tail is much longer and far more spindly than tail of fairywrens. The trick to finding this shy species is to find large unburned patches of spinifex, listening carefully for the species’ very thin, faint calls."
0,Malleefowl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Megapodiidae,Leipoa ocellata,https://ebird.org/species/mallee1,"Heavily-built grayish ground-dwelling bird with short heavy legs, gray neck and chest, and strongly marked (camouflaged) back and tail. Scarce endemic resident of semi-arid open forest (typically the multi-stemmed ""Mallee"" Eucalypt vegetation). Builds large nest-mounds from leaf litter. Most sightings are of single birds or pairs."
0,Mamberamo Shrikethrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Colluricincla obscura,https://ebird.org/species/litshr1,"A chunky bird with a notably thick dark bill. Quite plain: gray-brown on the upperparts and paler below, with indistinct breast streaking. Overall color varies geographically from dark gray to paler and browner, especially on the underparts. Found at low and middle elevations in humid forest, including secondary forest. Rich, melodious, variable song consists of several penetrating whistles, generally in an up-and-down pattern, often ending with a sharp upslurred note. Somewhat similar to Rusty Pitohui, but smaller, with a dark rather than pale eye. Can be very similar to Sooty Shrikethrush and Black Pitohui, but slightly paler, especially on the underparts, and shows some streaking on the breast."
0,Manchurian Bush Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Horornis canturians,https://ebird.org/species/manbuw1,"Warm brownish songbird of shrubby forest edges, reedbeds, and gardens. Brown above, pale below, with pale supercilium and dark eyeline. Note rufous crown. Shy and skulking, rarely straying from dense undergrowth even when singing. Usually detected by its song, a long mournful whistle followed by a quick burst of rich, bubbly notes. All but indistinguishable from Japanese Bush Warbler; averages slightly more rufous on the crown, but best identified by range and voice."
0,Manchurian Reed Warbler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acrocephalidae,Acrocephalus tangorum,https://ebird.org/species/manrew1,"Small, shy, and poorly understood, this reed warbler breeds in the remote marshlands of northeastern China and Russia and winters in drier, grassier habitats in Southeast Asia. Warm brown overall with a clean-cut whitish brow and throat; brow extends well behind the eye, unlike in Blunt-winged Warbler. Very similar to extralimital Paddyfield Warbler, but Paddyfield shows dark-tipped lower mandible, duller brown tones overall, and a dirtier brow stripe with a distinctive pinch just before the eye, after which it fades out; Manchurian’s brow broadens behind the eye instead. Oriental Reed Warbler much larger, with a weaker head pattern. Rambling jumbled song consists of high-pitched warbling notes and sharp clicks and rattles; more pleasant-sounding than that of Oriental Reed Warbler."
0,Mandarin Duck,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Anseriformes,Anatidae,Aix galericulata,https://ebird.org/species/manduc,"Small exotic-looking duck found at lakes and parks, usually with nearby trees. Male very ornate with big orangey ""sail fins"" on the back, streaked orangey cheeks, and a small red bill with a whitish tip. Female has narrow white spectacles on shaggy gray head, bold pale dappled spots along flanks, and pale bill tip. Mainly found in pairs or singly, but will gather in larger flocks over the winter; perches readily in trees over water. Native to East Asia, but has established feral populations throughout Western Europe."
0,Maned Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Jubula lettii,https://ebird.org/species/manowl1,"Distinctive and unusual rainforest owl. Mostly rufous-brown, with long, shaggy ear tufts and plumes at the back of the head. The eyes vary from yellow to orange. The breast is rufous and the belly is buff with fine black streaks. Rare and local in the understory of lowland rainforest in thick areas, usually those with abundant lianas. The voice is unknown. Somewhat similar to some eagle-owls, but smaller and slimmer, with differently shaped drooping ear tufts."

0,Mangrove Blue Flycatcher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cyornis rufigastra,https://ebird.org/species/mabfly2,"Bright blue-and-orange flycatcher of coastal woodlands; found in mangroves, mangrove edge, coastal scrub, and plantations. Can be common on small, forested offshore islands where other blue flycatchers are absent. Male and female are similar, but the female has lighter orange underparts and a pale patch between the eye and the base of the bill. Habitat generally serves to identify this species, but also note extent of orange underparts, pale blue patch on the forehead, short bill, and dark rump and tail. Both sexes sing, giving a short but beautiful series of fluty whistles. Calls include a fast buzzing rattle and tapping notes, comparable to rocks being struck together."
0,Mangrove Cuckoo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Cuculiformes,Cuculidae,Coccyzus minor,https://ebird.org/species/mancuc,"Slender, long-tailed bird found in shrubby woodland (especially mangroves). Brown above and buffy below with gray cap, black mask, and bold black-and-white pattern on underside of tail. Bill is black on top, yellow below. Similar to Yellow-billed Cuckoo, but note buffy belly, black mask, and no rufous in the wings. Shy; tends to sit still for long periods of time, can be difficult to spot. Song is a series of low croaking notes, gradually becoming longer and lower-pitched. Feeds primarily on insects and small reptiles."
0,Mangrove Fantail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Rhipiduridae,Rhipidura phasiana,https://ebird.org/species/manfan1,"Small pale gray flycatcher, exclusively coastal and usually observed in or very close to mangroves. Pale gray head and back, white throat and chin, pale wingbars, and a very thin gray chest band. Holds tail up and frequently fans it as it forages. Compare Gray Fantail, which is larger, darker, and has a wider black chest band, and Northern Fantail, which has a pale-streaked gray chest without a dark narrow band and lacks the pale streak behind the eye."
0,Mangrove Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Camarhynchus heliobates,https://ebird.org/species/manfin1,"A critically endangered Galápagos finch and one of the world’s rarest birds. Currently known only from mangroves at a few sites (with restricted access) on Isabela. Formerly found on Fernandina, but there are no recent substantiated records there. Both sexes typically have brown upperparts, whitish underparts with tan streaking, and a faint eyebrow. Some older males may have a faint, dark hood. Bill is relatively long, with a curved upper edge and mostly straight lower edge. Male’s bill is black when breeding and slightly paler at other times. Female’s bill is orange. Similar to Woodpecker Finch, but that species has a longer bill and less prominent streaking."
0,Mangrove Gerygone,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Gerygone levigaster,https://ebird.org/species/manger1,"Small plain bird with thin bill. Upperparts gray, underparts whitish, with striking white tail spots (best seen in flight), pale eyebrow, and red eye. Usually detected by song, a tinkling melodious string of notes moving up and down in pitch (like a musician practicing scales). Inhabits mangroves and surrounding habitats, unlikely to be far from mangroves."
0,Mangrove Honeyeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Meliphagidae,Gavicalis fasciogularis,https://ebird.org/species/manhon1,"Medium-sized honeyeater found in coastal habitats of eastern Australia. Back is brown-green, breast is gray, and underparts are pale. Distinguished from Varied Honeyeater by presence of clear barring on the throat and lack of yellow underparts and breast streaking. Usually found in or around mangroves, where it is typically quite conspicuous and vocal."
0,Mangrove Hummingbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Trochilidae,Amazilia boucardi,https://ebird.org/species/manhum1,"This restricted species is found only along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, most often in or near mangrove trees.

0,Mangrove Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Halcyon senegaloides,https://ebird.org/species/mankin2,"Mid-sized, big-billed, colorful kingfisher. Adults have an all-red bill and a pale gray head. Found in mangroves, coastal forest, woodland, and scrub. Loud call is an introductory note followed by a “bouncing ball” series of wooden trills. Woodland Kingfisher is similar, but Mangrove is separated by its grayer head and all-red bill. Immatures of the two species are very similar, but Mangrove usually shows a red bill with a black tip, as opposed to a mostly black bill in Woodland."
0,Mangrove Pitta,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pittidae,Pitta megarhyncha,https://ebird.org/species/manpit1,"The huge crab-smashing bill of this mangrove specialist sets it apart from all other pittas. Brightly colored with a black mask, green-and-black wings, and a yellow belly. Similar in color to Blue-winged Pitta, but note Mangrove’s larger-headed appearance and habitat. Like other pittas, shy and difficult to see; listen for its throaty and fluid two-parted whistles."
0,Mangrove Rail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Gruiformes,Rallidae,Rallus longirostris,https://ebird.org/species/manrai1,"Large, generally drab rail, of coastal salt lagoons and mangrove forests. Dull grayish-brown overall with few contrasting features; faintly barred gray-and-white on sides and pale orange bill.

0,Mangrove Robin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Petroicidae,Eopsaltria pulverulenta,https://ebird.org/species/manrob1,"Small round songbird of dense mangrove areas, particularly the large stilt-rooted mangroves. White below, dark gray above, with blackish wings and white patches on sides of black tail. Distinctive species, much more rotund than other white-chinned bird species in this habitat (e.g., female Shining Flycatcher). Voice is a plaintive, slow, whistled note, usually repeated."
0,Mangrove Swallow,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Tachycineta albilinea,https://ebird.org/species/manswa1,"Small swallow of tropical lowlands. Usually near water, from mangroves and coastal lagoons to rivers well inland; mainly in small groups, often mixed with other species of swallows. In its range, the big white rump patch is distinctive. Adult is metallic blue above with small white chevron across base of bill; gleaming white below. Juvenile has dusky gray-brown upperparts with white rump, looks like adult by early winter."
0,Mangrove Vireo,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Vireonidae,Vireo pallens,https://ebird.org/species/manvir1,"Despite the name, not found in mangroves in most of its range. Common in scrubby woodland, brushy fields, and thickets of Yucatan Peninsula. Also very local in mangroves along the Pacific coast. Best field marks are the white wingbars and the yellow patch between the eyes and bill; most birds are pale yellowish below, a few are paler and grayer overall. Birds in mangroves of Central America are often rather colorless, with very reduced yellow tones. Twanging song is a common sound in much of Yucatan Peninsula."
0,Mangrove Whistler,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pachycephalidae,Pachycephala cinerea,https://ebird.org/species/manwhi1,"Drab small bird with brownish-gray upperparts and white underparts. Resides primarily in mangrove forest, but can also be found in other well-vegetated adjacent habitat types. Overall lack of prominent markings distinguishes it from other mangrove species within its range. Song varies; Indian birds give songs containing long ringing whistles, while Southeast Asian birds give somewhat more complex whistled phrases."
0,Manipur Bush-Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Phasianidae,Perdicula manipurensis,https://ebird.org/species/mabqua1,"Poorly known. Small, dark gray quail with a short white eye-stripe. The dark upperparts are scaled with black, while the yellowish-brown belly has strong, black spots. The male has a reddish face, while the female’s face is gray.

0,Manu Antbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thamnophilidae,Cercomacra manu,https://ebird.org/species/manant1,"Skinny antbird of bamboo stands. Males are dark gray or black with small white wing bars and white spots on the underside of the tail; females are gray below, brown above, looking dark overall, with faint buffy wing bars and spots on the underside of the tail. Almost always found in bamboo thickets. Listen for its distinctive song, a rubbery, bouncing “pook-cha-pook-cha-pook-cha.” Distinguished from the similar Gray Antbird by male’s nearly black plumage (not gray) and female’s grayer underparts (not uniformly brown). Males also are similar to Dot-winged Antwren, but are larger, with less white on the wing bars and slightly lighter overall plumage (not glossy black like the antwren)."
0,Manus Boobook,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox meeki,https://ebird.org/species/manhao1,"A medium-sized brown owl with a rounded head and yellow eyes. Head and upperparts dark brown, with indistinct scattered pale markings above. Chest and belly white with prominent dark streaking. Juvenile shows bolder pale markings above and less heavy streaking below. Occupies forest and more open areas with scattered trees. Confined to Manus. Distinctive: one of only two owl species present on Manus, the other being the very different Manus Masked-Owl, a type of barn-owl. Manus Boobok gives a frog-like song of repetitive rough, curt “grrr” notes."

Found singly or in pairs in forest edges and open environments with trees, avoiding dense forest. The smaller Manus Cicadabird is the only other cuckooshrike in its limited range on the Admiralty Islands; the cuckooshrike can be distinguished from the cicadabird by its white belly. Gives “kitcheek” or “sh-zick” calls."
0,Manus Dwarf-Kingfisher,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Coraciiformes,Alcedinidae,Ceyx dispar,https://ebird.org/species/vardwk7,"A small blue-and-orange kingfisher with a bright waxy orange bill, ginger underparts, a white throat, and blue upperparts with a bright white neck spot. Female has a bright orange, not blue, head with a blue crown. Found in forest habitats, not necessarily near water, tolerating plantations and degraded forest. No other dwarf-kingfisher shares its range. Told from Common Kingfisher by smaller size and entirely red bill. Call apparently nearly identical that of other Melanesian dwarf-kingfishers: a high-pitched, weak repetitive whistle, often given in flight."

Dark blackish-brown head, breast, upperparts, and tail. Rump and belly white with variable dark streaking running down from breast. Underwings have pale panel with broad dark edge. Note especially long legs, with feet trailing well behind the square tail. Thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 2003 on Little Barrier Island, which remains the only known breeding location. At sea, recorded mostly around New Zealand’s northern waters. Four similar species: Wilson’s Storm-Petrel has dark underparts and underwing; Black-bellied Storm-Petrel is larger, with shorter legs that still extend past tail and with a white belly that has a black line down the middle; White-bellied Storm-Petrel is larger, with feet that do not extend past tail; Gray-backed Storm-Petrel does not have a white rump."
0,Maquis Canastero,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Asthenes heterura,https://ebird.org/species/maqcan1,"Slender and long-tailed canastero of the high Andes from Cochabamba, Bolivia south to NE Argentina. Prefers scrubby hillsides, ravines, and open Polylepis woodland above treeline. Distinguished from the more common Puna and Creamy-breasted Canasteros by lack of streaked back (from Puna) and brown cap and long, slender tail (from Creamy-breasted). Often in pairs or small family groups, though can be quite elusive. Song a rising series of slightly nasal whistles, each of which descends and the ascends rapidly in pitch: “tuwhee-tuwee-tuwhee-tuweeh-tee!”"

A white ruff and loose inflatable skin on the neck add to its odd appearance. It soars effortlessly at great heights searching for food; note its white belly in flight. Marabous are equally content in wetlands or in dry bush; they are most frequently encountered lurking near carrion, as they attend kills of major predators and will opportunistically snatch scraps. They also readily scavenge around humans and waste dumps."
0,Marail Guan,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Cracidae,Penelope marail,https://ebird.org/species/margua1,"Medium-sized guan of rainforest canopy. Usually appears entirely dark; note short-legged profile, contrasting red throat patch, and sluggish behavior. Slips quietly through canopy, feeding on fruit; typically found alone or in pairs but may congregate at fruiting trees. Generally wary, especially where hunted, but sometimes tolerates close approach. May be seen near the ground at forest edge or along roadsides. Very similar to Spix’s Guan; Marail is smaller and shorter-legged, but this can be surprisingly difficult to judge accurately."

Males have dark gray upperparts, pale gray underparts, and black wings and tail. Females have brown upperparts, a whitish throat, and otherwise rufous underparts. Both sexes have pale marks at the tip of the tail. The juvenile is a drastically different-looking brownish bird with strong wing bars and unmarked buff underparts. Rare and local in remnant patches of humid forest on the island of Mauritius. The song is a quick, slightly accelerating series of nasal whistles. Within its small range, most similar to Mauritius Bulbul, but easily separated by many details, including the lack of an orange bill."
0,Mauritius Fody,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Foudia rubra,https://ebird.org/species/maufod1,"A sparrow-like weaver. Red-hooded breeding males are distinctive, but females and non-breeding males are drab. A rare Mauritius endemic that is found in and adjacent to humid forest and woodland. Can be very similar to Red Fody. Breeding male Mauritius Fody lacks red on the back and belly, though molting male Red Fody can match this pattern. Females and non-breeding males very similar to Red Fody, but Mauritius Fody is darker and more greenish, with a longer, slimmer, slightly curved bill. Also similar to female House Sparrow, but distinguished by the thinner bill. Calls include high, silvery notes and lower-pitched “vet” notes. Both are sometimes given in a series."

Call is a high, repeated “keek.” Shares general falcon shape with migrant Eleanora’s and Sooty Falcons, but smaller, with shorter, less pointed wings."
0,Maxwell's Black Weaver,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Ploceidae,Ploceus albinucha,https://ebird.org/species/mabwea1,"An entirely black forest weaver with piercing white eyes found in low-elevation and foothill forests, in small groups or with mixed-species flocks, sometimes with other species of weaver. Occasionally forms much larger groups, and will sometimes nest in large single-species or mixed-species colonies. Birds in the western part of the range have a silver nape, but birds in the east are wholly black. Western populations are nearly identical to co-occurring populations of Vieillot’s Weaver, but have a thinner, pointier bill and prefer more forested habitats. Vocalizations include dry chatters and soft mechanical rasps, sometimes given in complex combinations."
0,Mayan Antthrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Formicariidae,Formicarius moniliger,https://ebird.org/species/bkfant2,"Elusive inhabitant of humid tropical lowlands and foothills from Veracruz to Honduras. Dark brown and gray overall with pale bluish eyering, darker throat, and rusty rump.

0,Mayotte Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus mayottensis,https://ebird.org/species/maysco1,"Small, compact dark owl with small ear tufts. Most birds have dark brown upperparts and medium-brown underparts, but there is a rare rufous morph with rich rufous underparts and head. Fairly common in remnant rainforest, secondary forest, gardens, and plantations on the island of Mayotte, in the Comoros. The remarkable vocalization is a series of several low-pitched hollow hoots. Sometimes active and vocal during the day, especially the early morning and late afternoon. Easily identified, as the only other owl on Mayotte is the much larger Barn Owl."
0,Mayotte Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris coquerellii,https://ebird.org/species/maysun2,"A small sunbird with a relatively short, slightly downcurved bill. Males are a beautiful mix of green, purple, red, and yellow. Females are fairly drab, with a dark-streaked pale breast and a yellow belly. Found in all habitats on the island of Mayotte, though most common in scrubby habitat rather than in forest. In its small range, it is the only sunbird, so it is easily identified by its bill shape. The song is a typical sunbird jumble of high-pitched notes, and the call is a rising whine."

Similar to Golden-tailed Woodpecker, but there is virtually no overlap in range, and Mombasa is easily distinguished by the pale throat and the spotted rather than barred back. Fairly similar to Reichenow’s Woodpecker, but distinguished by the striped rather than spotted breast. The vocalizations include a repeated “kree” call and a raspy, trilled “krrrrr.”"
0,Mongolian Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Bucanetes mongolicus,https://ebird.org/species/monfin2,"A pale, large-billed finch found in dry areas with sparse plant cover. Usually seen in small and medium-sized groups. Pinkish hues make it superficially similar to rosefinches, but it is much paler overall with very different patterning. Male is brown with a pink blush on the brow, rump, breast, and wings. Females are pale gray-brown with much fainter, almost unnoticeable, pink. White wing stripes flash brightly in flight."
0,Mongolian Short-toed Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Calandrella dukhunensis,https://ebird.org/species/sstlar4,"A small lark with a short, conical bill. It appears long and horizontal, and has strong streaks on the upperparts. Very similar to Greater Short-toed Lark, but Sykes’s is slightly larger, is warmer brown with a rust-colored tinge on the breast and underparts, and has bolder streaking. It usually inhabits open, dry grassy habitats. Song is a prolonged melodious jumble of notes, often given in flight. Calls, often heard when individuals or flocks go overhead, are distinctly trilly, with a squeaky-wet quality to them: “tr’liu, tr’liu, liu, liu”; not as strong and insistent-sounding as the calls of Greater Short-toed Lark."
0,Monk Parakeet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Psittaciformes,Psittacidae,Myiopsitta monachus,https://ebird.org/species/monpar,"Native to South America, where it is found in various open habitats, especially rural agricultural areas and towns. Introduced colonies can be found in large cities. Bright lime green above with whitish face and chest, pinkish bill, and blue wingtips. Builds enormous stick nests, often on large structures like cell phone towers and power poles. Listen for its harsh, screeching voice."
0,Monotonous Lark,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Alaudidae,Mirafra passerina,https://ebird.org/species/monlar2,"A medium-small, compact lark with a small bill, a plain face, and an indistinct eyebrow. It has streaky upperparts with a distinct rufous wing panel and a lightly-streaked buffy chest that separates the white throat from the pale belly. Its movement patterns are poorly understood; it is nomadic, appearing unpredictably in large numbers to breed after rain. The male sits on perches, incessantly singing a croaking, gurgling, distinctive four-note “for-syrup-is-sweet” song every 3-5 seconds for hours on end, day and night, earning it its name. When singing, the male stretches its neck, puffs out its whitish throat feathers, and raises a small crest. Occasionally the male rises up 5-10 meters in the air on rapidly flapping wings, sings, and parachutes back down to a prominent perch. The similar Latakoo Lark is smaller than the Monotonous Lark, with a bolder facial pattern including an eyebrow, and a different song and display."
0,Montagu's Harrier,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Circus pygargus,https://ebird.org/species/monhar1,"Lightly built hawk with rather narrow and somewhat tapered wings. Favors heathland, grassland, arable fields, marshes. Mainly seen in flight, quartering fairly low with wings raised in shallow V; flight rather buoyant. Male pale gray overall with black wingtips (can be confused with a gull); note narrow black bar on upperwing. Female told from Hen Harrier by narrower wings, more buoyant flight; juvenile bright rusty below. Some individuals are very dark overall. Pallid Harrier males lack the black wing bars and rusty traces on the underparts of their Montagu's counterparts, while Pallid females and juveniles average far paler in the face."
0,Montane Woodcreeper,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Furnariidae,Lepidocolaptes lacrymiger,https://ebird.org/species/monwoo1,"Fairly small and slender woodcreeper found in Andean subtropical zone from Venezuela to Bolivia. Warm brown overall, with rufous wings and tail. Distinct white streaking on underparts, white throat, and white eyebrow. Note slender, obviously decurved bill, which is useful to separate Montane from other woodcreepers in range. Fairly common in mossy cloud forest, where it frequently follows mixed species flocks. Like other woodcreepers, hitches up tree trunks and large limbs."
0,Monte Yellow-Finch,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sicalis mendozae,https://ebird.org/species/monyef1,"Small yellow terrestrial finch-like tanager of the Monte desert of central Argentina. Distinguished from most other Yellow-finches by its uniform bright yellow underparts, and from Saffron Finch by Monte Yellow-Finch’s larger bill and lack of orange in forecrown."
0,Monteiro's Bushshrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Malaconotidae,Malaconotus monteiri,https://ebird.org/species/monbus1,"A large, robust bushshrike with a massive head, a chunky hook-tipped bill, and a gray eye and head; a white patch on the face often extends above and below the eye. Wings are green, spotted with yellow. Pairs skulk at middle levels and in the canopy of montane and gallery forest and plantation edges, seldom joining flocks. The species forages slowly and deliberately, hopping along branches, diligently searching for food. Gray-headed Bushshrike, which prefers savanna, differs from the larger Monteiro’s by having pale yellow eyes and a white facial patch that is restricted to the area between the eye and bill base. Monteiro’s gives a low-pitched extended sorrowful “whhooooooo” song repeatedly, along with various harsh clicks and rasps."
0,Monteiro's Hornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Bucerotiformes,Bucerotidae,Tockus monteiri,https://ebird.org/species/monhor1,"Brown hornbill with a white belly and a yellow-and-orange bill. The white outer tail feathers and wing patches are conspicuous in flight. Found in arid savanna. Usually solitary or in pairs; sometimes in small flocks. Call is a series of clucking notes that accelerates and becomes louder. Fairly similar to Bradfield’s Hornbill, but has white in the wings, much more white in the tail, and a yellow base to the bill."
0,Monteiro's Storm-Petrel,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Procellariiformes,Hydrobatidae,Hydrobates monteiroi,https://ebird.org/species/monstp1,"Very similar to Band-rumped Storm-Petrel, and closely related to it. Both taxa differ mainly in timing of breeding and subsequent wing molt: Monteiro's Storm-Petrel breeds in summer and molt post-breeding, while Band-rumped breeds in winter and molts in winter. Morphologically they are very similar, however Monteiro's has on average a longer and more deeply-forked tail. Breeds in burrows and crevices on islands."
0,Montezuma Oropendola,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Icteridae,Psarocolius montezuma,https://ebird.org/species/monoro1,"Spectacular, very large ‘blackbird’ of tropical lowlands. Favors forest edge, open woodland, plantations, semi-open areas with trees; colonies of large pendulous nests adorn tall trees. Male is much larger than female, but sexes look similar: dark rusty overall with a black head, bold yellow sides to the tail, and ornate face and bill patterning. Flies rather directly, with slow, ‘rowing’ wingbeats. Memorable gurgling song sounds like water poured from a bottle."
0,Montezuma Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Cyrtonyx montezumae,https://ebird.org/species/monqua,"A remarkably patterned quail, uncommon and difficult to spot as it runs through open grassy woodlands in dry regions of the southwest U.S. and Mexico. Male looks like he’s are wearing a black-and-white helmet; otherwise look for bold spots and streaks covering body and wings. Female is more subtly patterned with shades of brown; look for rounded, puffy head shape. Between bursts of running, often crouches motionless and becomes nearly invisible. Rarely flies unless flushed at very close range; most often seen crossing a road or trail. Male song is a rich descending whistle with unique ethereal tone like an incoming spaceship."

0,Moreau's Sunbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Nectariniidae,Cinnyris moreaui,https://ebird.org/species/morsun2,"A medium-sized sunbird. Males are very colorful, with a shining coppery-green iridescence on the head and back and a purple-and-red breast band with yellow sides. Females are drab yellowish-brown. Found locally in montane forest, especially clearings and forest edge. Similar to Forest Double-collared Sunbird, but there is only minor overlap in range, and males are separated by their broad yellow sides. The calls include a squeaky “tseet” that often precedes a very quick jumble of high-pitched notes."
0,Morelet's Seedeater,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Thraupidae,Sporophila morelleti,https://ebird.org/species/whcsee1,"Fairly common little bird of grassland and weedy areas in the tropical lowlands and foothills. Occurs from Texas to Panama. Often in flocks, mixing readily with other “weed-eating” small birds. Plumage is very variable, but all birds have a stubby dark bill with a curved culmen. Usually shows two whitish wingbars. Breeding plumage males with a black cap and bold white collar are usually outnumbered by female-plumaged birds, which are plain brownish, sometimes showing buffy wingbars."
0,Morepork,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Ninox novaeseelandiae,https://ebird.org/species/morepo2,"Small brownish owl with dark ‘glasses’ surrounding eyes. Fairly common in a wide variety of habitats in Tasmania and New Zealand.

Range of the northern subspecies overlaps slightly with that of Yunnan Fulvetta, from which it can be distinguished by duller, more olive-green upperparts, a bolder black line above the eye, and colder gray-washed underparts. Southern subspecies, found in peninsular Malaysia and southern Thailand, is richer brown above with a whiter belly. Fast twittering song is comparable to that of Yunnan Fulvetta but somewhat quicker and shorter. Dry churring rattles are likewise similar to those of Yunnan Fulvetta. Despite its name, does not necessarily inhabit higher altitudes than Yunnan Fulvetta, and altitudinal ranges do overlap."
0,Cameroon Mountain Greenbul,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Pycnonotidae,Arizelocichla montana,https://ebird.org/species/camgre2,"A medium-sized greenbul of the mountains of Cameroon and southeastern Nigeria. Remarkably uniform yellow-olive in plumage, with a red eye. Found in montane forest, secondary habitat, and scrub. Feeds in the understory and at middle levels of the forest. Somewhat similar to Western Mountain Greenbul, but easily separated by the lack of a gray head and contrasting white eye crescents. Might be confused with Cameroon Olive-Greenbul, but separated by brighter coloration overall and an olive-green rather than reddish-brown tail. The song is a chirpy series of nasal notes that ends with an accelerating flourish."

0,Mountain Peltops,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Artamidae,Peltops montanus,https://ebird.org/species/moupel1,"A medium-sized bird of montane forest edge and clearings. Distinctive plumage. Mainly black, bright red above and below the base of the tail; and white marks on the cheek and back. Perches in tall trees, sallying for flying insects. Very similar to Lowland Peltops, but Mountain is found at higher elevations and has larger white cheeks. Voice, a high-pitch, downward trill, sounding rather like a cricket."
0,Mountain Pipit,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Motacillidae,Anthus hoeschi,https://ebird.org/species/moupip1,"A large, dark, boldly marked pipit with a pinkish base to the bill. Pairs breed in alpine scrub and grassland above 2000 meters of elevation from October to April, before dispersing to wintering grounds presumed to be in Central Africa. It runs between bushes foraging on the ground, and occasionally perches up to sing. It has a long undulating display flight; the flight call is a 2-syllable “chiREE,” slower and deeper than other pipits. The similar African Pipit differs from the Mountain Pipit by having a yellow (not pink) base to the bill, white (not buff) outer tail feathers, and less heavily marked plumage. The Long-billed Pipit is more slender, with a longer tail and a less boldly marked face, back, and chest."
0,Mountain Plover,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Charadriiformes,Charadriidae,Charadrius montanus,https://ebird.org/species/mouplo,"Medium-sized, plain buffy plover that favors flat open areas with little or no vegetation. Plain whitish underparts with no breast band. Look for black forehead and white eyebrow in breeding plumage. Nonbreeding birds have a plainer face. Also note slender dark bill and upright posture. Rare and local. Rather poorly-named; essentially never seen in mountainous regions. Breeds on shortgrass prairies, often with areas of bare ground. Winters in flocks in barren fields, from the southwestern U.S. to central Mexico."
0,Mountain Quail,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Galliformes,Odontophoridae,Oreortyx pictus,https://ebird.org/species/mouqua,"Uncommon and more often heard than seen. Listen for the male's ventriloquial song, a rich whistled ""PWEE-uh"" that carries for great distances. Found in scrubby montane forest, often in small groups. Boldly patterned quail with tones of rich chestnut and blue-gray accentuated by white highlights. Look especially for the long, straight black plume atop the head and thick white bars on the sides, which help separate this species from California Quail. Female is slightly drabber than male."
0,Mountain Robin-Chat,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Muscicapidae,Cossypha isabellae,https://ebird.org/species/morcha1,"A fairly plain brown-and-orange robin-chat with a white eyebrow and a dark face. As in most robin-chats, the tail has a dark center and orange edges. An inconspicuous bird of the understory of montane forest. Sometimes follows columns of ants. Similar to White-bellied Robin-Chat, but distinguished by the orange belly and the much bolder white eyebrow. Also similar to Bocage’s Akalat, but distinguished by the white eyebrow and the two-colored tail. The song is a series of several squeaky, rasping whistles, far less conspicuous and musical than the vocalizations of most robin-chats."
0,Mountain Sawwing,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Hirundinidae,Psalidoprocne fuliginosa,https://ebird.org/species/mousaw1,"An entirely brownish-black swallow with darker wings and a forked tail. Often encountered in groups at the forest edge and in montane grassland. Only found on Bioko, where it is the only sawwing, and on Mt. Cameroon, where it is the common sawwing of high elevations. Calls are short, liquid “shu-shu” notes. Appears similar to other sawwings, especially to young Black Sawwings, but Mountain Sawwing is completely dark all over, including on the underwing."
0,Mountain Scops-Owl,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Strigiformes,Strigidae,Otus spilocephalus,https://ebird.org/species/mosowl2,"Small brown owl of hilly and montane broadleaf forests, rarely in parks and gardens. Dark brown above, paler on the underparts and face, with bright yellow eyes. Prominent bright white stripe between back and wings is more contrasting than in other owls in its range. Brows are frosty white, as in larger Collared Scops-Owl, but ear tufts much shorter in Mountain. Song is a long series of soft double hoots, with 5-10 second pauses between each pair of notes."
0,Mountain Serin,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Fringillidae,Chrysocorythus estherae,https://ebird.org/species/mouser1,"Rare and localized highland finch, restricted to upper montane forest and open scrubby and grassy habitats above the treeline. Generally not very obvious, often foraging quietly in dense growth, but flocks will sometimes betray their presence by flying overhead and giving a chorus of chittering twitter calls. Found only on high peaks in Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and Mindanao. Combination of thick conical bill, bright yellow wing-bars, and well-streaked underparts are unique within this species’ range and habitat. Extent of yellow on males’ faces varies, with the Mindanao population having the most extensive yellow. A currently undescribed population in north-central Sulawesi has reddish-orange in place of other populations’ yellow patches. Song is a dry, whirring buzz following a few husky notes."
0,Mountain Serpent-Eagle,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Accipitriformes,Accipitridae,Spilornis kinabaluensis,https://ebird.org/species/moseag1,"Small, striking eagle with broad, rounded wings. Broad white wing bands and base to tail prominent in flight. At rest, note dark head and chestnut underparts. Darker overall than similar Crested Serpent-Eagle and appears longer-winged in flight. Adult Blyth’s Hawk-Eagle can be similar in flight, but appears smaller-headed, with more intricately-marked underwings. Restricted to north Bornean montane forest, where it can often be seen soaring above ridges. Gives a short, shrill scream."
0,Mountain Shrike,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Laniidae,Lanius validirostris,https://ebird.org/species/gycshr1,"A medium-sized bird of montane clearings and shrubland. Has a typical shrike shape, with a long tail and hooked bill. Gray above with darker wings and tail, white underparts, orange sides, and a black mask through the eye. Some races have more orange on the underparts. Similar to Long-tailed Shrike, but usually occurs in more wooded areas at higher elevations, is slightly shorter-tailed, and lacks a white spot in the wing. Calls include a dry “chit!” note and a repeated grating alarm call, “krr-krr-krr-krr-krr!”"
0,Mountain Starling,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Sturnidae,Aplonis santovestris,https://ebird.org/species/mousta1,"Dark brown starling with pale eyes. Darkest on crown and brightest, with chestnut tinting, on rump and underparts. Endemic to the western half of the Vanuatuan island of Espiritu Santo, where it is found only in remote, rugged montane cloud forest. Behavioral information is extremely sparse, but generally known to forage low in the mid- and understorey, typically singly or in pairs. Reported to give various harsh calls, including a series of repeated buzzy notes."
0,Mountain Swiftlet,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Caprimulgiformes,Apodidae,Aerodramus hirundinaceus,https://ebird.org/species/mouswi2,"A common, mid-sized swiftlet found over forests and open areas, mainly in the mountains. Slender shape and a notched tail that it sometimes fans. Gray-brown with a contrasting darker tail and forewing. Often seen in flocks and can fly at all levels. Does long glides with tips of the wings held down slightly, and sometimes tipping from side to side. Not safely distinguished from the lowland Uniform Swiftlet. Call, a high-pitch, up-and-down chatter including some grating notes."
0,Mountain Tailorbird,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Scotocercidae,Phyllergates cucullatus,https://ebird.org/species/moutai2,"Tiny warbler with a long bill and frequently cocked tail. Secretive, tending to stick to the brushy underlayer of hill and submontane forest. Often moves about solitarily, but can sometimes be found with mixed-species flocks, especially with small warblers and fulvettas. Green above and yellow below, with a pale gray throat. Somewhat resembles a Common or Dark-necked tailorbird, but only a fraction of the size, with a proportionally far longer bill, black eye-stripe, and bright orange forehead. Song is an extremely high-pitched tinkling series of whistled notes with an otherworldly quality. Calls include high descending trills and dry chittering."
0,Mountain Thornbill,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Acanthizidae,Acanthiza katherina,https://ebird.org/species/moutho1,"Small bird with thin pointed bill found in middle- to high-elevation rainforests in far northern Queensland. Greenish gray above, pale below, with faint streaks on chest, pale eye, and faint pale speckling on gray forecrown. Forages among leaves of forest canopy. Compare Brown Gerygone, which has darker eye and white tail tips."
0,Mountain Thrush,Animalia,Chordata,Aves,Passeriformes,Turdidae,Turdus plebejus,https://ebird.org/species/mourob1,"Rather dull-colored large thrush of mountain forests, rarely encountered. Feeds mainly in fruiting trees and bushes, less often on the ground. Both sexes gray-brown overall with a black bill and dark legs. If seen well, only confusion species is female Black Thrush, which occurs in the same areas and even at the same fruiting trees. Note that female Black Thrush has yellowish legs, faint throat streaking, and slightly warmer brown tones."
